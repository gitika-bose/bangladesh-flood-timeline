      "text": "   The global climate change is one of the most significant environmental issues of the present world. The problem of this human-induced climate change first came to the attention of the global public and international policy makers when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its first assessment report in 1990 (Huq and et.al).\nThe effects of global climate change are evident now, as we are experiencing through irregular weather conditions. These effects are multidimensional. Among the many effects, scientific evidence has proved that several low-lying countries of the world will be badly affected by climate change, and scientists are predicting that Bangladesh will be among the countries most affected by the change (The Daily Ittefaq, June 22).\nThe sea level along the Bangladesh coast is rising at about 3 millimeters a year, and the sea surface temperature is also showing a rising trend (Bangladesh National Adaptation Program of Action, 2000). Bangladesh is facing the reality of climate change due to global warming like other parts of the planet.\nThe climate pattern is altering across the world due to global warming. This will have an impact on the composition of the atmosphere, hydrology, geomorphology, ecology, soil, land use, biological diversity, vegetation etc. The individual impacts on each environmental component also have interactive effects. Environmental components are interrelated, and the world's ecosystems are linked to these components. Therefore, many natural ecosystems will be changed as a result of climate change.\nThe tropical and subtropical countries will be more vulnerable to the potential impact of global warming through the effects on crops, soils, insects, weeds, and diseases (Bangladesh State of the Environment, 2001). Bangladesh is in the subtropical region. Therefore, the agriculture of this country will be affected. The effects of climate change are already evident in the agro-ecosystem of the country.\nAgriculture is strongly interrelated with climatic factors. Temperature, which is one of the main factors of climate, is closely associated with agricultural production. In agriculture, rice production is affected by deviation in temperature. Climate change will increase the temperature, which will bring changes in rice farming activities and affect crops yields.\nVarious studies indicate that a rise of 10C to 20C, in combination with lower solar radiation, causes sterility in rice spikelets, and high temperature was found to reduce yields of HYVs of aus, aman and boro rice in all study locations and in all seasons in Bangladesh (Bangladesh National Adaptation Program of Action 2000). As temperature has an influence on plants, temperature change will modify rate of pollination and flower blooming, seed distribution, plant growth etc., as a result production of rice, wheat, and maize will decrease.\nClimate change will act as a factor for sea level rise in the costal regions of Bangladesh. This will cause an increase in salinity in water and soil in the coastal regions. Growth of standing crops (like rice, jute, sugarcane etc.) will be affected due to soil salinity, and this will limit overall crop production in the costal regions as well as make the soil unsuitable for many potential crops.\nThe index of aridity will increase during winter under changed climate conditions. As a result, an increased rate of desiccation in topsoil, leading to higher rates of capillary action, will be observed.\nIt is expected that due to climate change, humidity, wind flow, and temperature in Bangladesh will be changed. These three climatic mechanisms, in changing conditions, cause an increase in insects, pests, diseases and microorganisms in agriculture, and accordingly, crop production will decrease.\nThe production of potato, brinjal, ladie's finger, tomato, cauliflower, sugarcane, groundnut, ginger, onion, garlic, banana, date, plum etc. will decrease. Increase of diseases, pests and insects will also effect transportation and storage of different crops and vegetable.\nLess rainfall during winter due to climate change will lead to a decrease in moisture content of the topsoil, as well as less recharging of the ground water. Higher evaporation will cause drought-like conditions. In summer, increased precipitation will worsen the flood situation, which will have negative effect on agriculture production (Bangladesh State of the Environment, 2001) . Climate change will lead to extreme weather, which will increase the burning or destruction of crops. Due to climate change, occurrence of tornadoes, cyclones and hailstorms will be greater than before. It will hamper the total agriculture production.\nBangladesh is an agro-economy based developing country. There is no doubt that its agriculture will be badly affected by the climate change. Loss in agriculture would increase many social problems, and force the import of food, which will require spending of hard currency.\nTherefore, from now on, adaptation and awareness about the impact of climate change in agriculture, and many other sectors, are imperative for the development of Bangladesh. In this respect, the government, the people of Bangladesh, and international bodies will have to work unitedly to face the climate change problem.Byomkesh Talukder is one of the Faculty Members of Bangladesh Public Administration Training Centre (BPATC), now doing his MSc in Environmental Policy at Graduate School for International Development and Cooperation (IDEC), Hiroshima University, Japan.

      "text": "WE have lost everything we worked for during our lives. We do not know when and where to start again\" was what I heard from most of the people of the devastated areas that I visited last week. Manikhali, Betaki and Amtali are the three places that I along with a few others visited after the ravaging cyclone Sidr, which razed everything on the fateful night of November 15.\nMost of the people who had to bear the brunt of the gusty 220 km per hour windstorm associated with 30-foot high tidal-bore were the poor people who occupied the most dangerous locations like flood plains, riverbanks and reclaimed land (char). It is often said that disasters seek out poor people and ensure that they stay poor. What an irony!\nWe know that natural vagaries are \"fait accompli,\" but efficient disaster management is very much in our hands. Vulnerability reduction is time consuming, but timeliness of response to disasters depends on detailed planning and committed implementation. Flawed planning exacerbates these factors and, thus, exposes more and more people to disasters.\nDisaster management encompasses planning and activities of pre-, during and post-disaster. In my opinion, disaster response requires quick evacuation, supply of relief materials, disposal of casualties and clearance of lines of communication immediately after the occurrence of disaster to enable victims to overcome the psychological fear of becoming destitute, regardless of their pre-disaster economic status.\nWhen we reached Manikkhali under Burirchar union of Borguna upazila, we were awestruck at the sight of a plain piece of land beside Peara River, which we were told was a cluster village. It was quite a difficult journey as the road on the barrier embankment (Beri Bund) had suffered topsoil erosion, creating crater after crater.\nSoon after, we stopped at a designated point, which had not been visited by anybody before us. Houses had been razed to the ground, large trees were uprooted, and cattle and people were swept away. Thanks Almighty, only a few lives were lost. People were wailing for the loss of means of livelihood, and some were shivering because of the trauma, which was still persisting.\nOn enquiry, we found that even though nobody had visited them on the spot, most of the victims were taken to relief distribution points and were given adequate relief materials. They felt that they needed money and construction material more than anything else. They also told us that the medical support they received was negligible. Their need for pure drinking water merits mention here. Taltali of Amtali upazila and Betaki upazila of Borguna had a similar saga to narrate. Their suggestion for post cyclone Sidr disaster management is no different.\nSome elderly people of the areas we visited complained that not enough workers were available to lend their helping hands to reconstruct the houses. When questioned about the reason, the reply was that so much food had been received that a part of the same was being sold to meet other household requirements, therefore, they did not feel the necessity of working on daily wages basis.\nWe met fairly large segment of cyclone stricken people who confided in us that they would not be able to pay their installments against the loans taken under microcredit scheme run by a few NGO's, and they did not hesitate to tell me that their experience pertaining to default in payment of installment was not pleasant.\nWe saw a few burials of cattle. The owners told us that some of them had stayed back in their huts to save their cattle, but their efforts ended in futility as the 20'-30' tidal bore simply swept those cattle away, and they themselves were lucky enough to be able to hold onto the branches and trunks of trees or swim to safety. Some even told us that there were not enough cyclone shelters to house the people and cattle in the area. So they preferred to stay home and save as much of their belongings as was possible.\nAlthough Bangladesh is known in the world as a success story in cyclone preparedness and post cyclone rehabilitation, our experience this time reveals that community response was not forthcoming. This brings to the fore the necessity of volunteerism on a large scale.\nWe met some young people, fairly well attired, in the makeshift tea stalls, who told us that they were yet to be marshaled to be assigned tasks. This statement is good enough to tell us that they were not imbibed with the spirit of volunteerism (maybe due to the lack of inspiring local leadership).\nWe held a few opinion exchange meetings at Borguna and Betaki, where we gathered that they were happy about the prompt response of the government but were not quite sure about long-term commitment of both the government and other relevant agencies. Some even suggested the creation of a coastal affairs division on the lines of the existing Hill Tract Affairs Division, so that it can prepare the nation over months and years to ensure risk reduction and efficient disaster management.\nKeeping the findings in mind, I have the following recommendations:\n It is indeed a gigantic task to cover every detail in the brief expanse of this article. It is the author's conviction that if these suggestions are followed many lives will be saved and damage to property will be controlled. Last but not least is the necessity of good governance, which can be ensured by social cohesion and solidarity that can be achieved through self-help and citizen based social participation at community level.\nTrust among the authorities and civil society, investment in human development, investment in social capital, institutional capital, transparency, attention to vulnerable groups, political commitment to risk reduction, effective risk communication system and attention to lifeline infrastructure are a few key points that should be ensured to mitigate human suffering in disasters."

      "text": "   Photo: STAR City markets have been flooded with counterfeit cellular phones that are basically imitation of popular name brands including Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Samsung, etc..\nThese fake phones can be easily found at most cellphone shops -- even with street vendors all over the capital.\nAlthough loaded with all the advanced features anyone can ever dream of, most of these cheap mobile phones are in fact substandard and flimsy. Lured by their attractive features along with the low prices, people are easily drawn into buying these cheap counterfeit mobile sets.\nDuring a visit in a cellphone market, it was found that hundreds of substandard fake cellular phones were being sold openly.\nWhen this correspondent asked Mahfuz, a cellphone retailer at Eastern Plaza, about the reason his store carries low-grade cellphones, he said, \"We keep both superior and inferior quality mobile sets to serve the needs of different buyers,\"\n\"We do warn the customers about the possible drawbacks of low-grade products, but most of them tend to prefer the cheap ones -- the substandard ones,\" added Mahfuz.\nWith the invasion of Chinese-made look-alikes of popular brands, there is a surge of poor quality mobile sets in the market and the users become the worst victims as they fall for the brand name at a cheap price.\nAdnan Habib, a student of Dhaka City College, purchased a feature-rich cellular phone at a price of Tk 6 thousand from Motalib Plaza. Habib was thrilled to own a cellular phone featuring a camera, video playback, BlueTooth along with mp3 and mp4 function at such a low price.\nWithin a month of the purchase, however, the display of his cell phone stopped functioning.\n\"After the display went out just like that, I went to a dozen places trying to find a replacement [display] and I found none. The set has become quite useless,\" said a dismayed Habib.\nA number of shopping centres in the city, especially Bangabandhu National Stadium Market, Motalib Plaza, Bashundhara City shopping complex, Rajlakshmi Complex, are swarming with substandard and counterfeit mobile sets.\nWhile some of these 'look-alike' phones are being sold without any logo or brand affixed on them, most others are sold by using names and logos that spell or look similar to those of the major brand names.\nDespite minor differences, the model numbers and the names or the logos affixed on the fake phones are readily indistinguishable from the original brand.\n\"Counterfeits of popular brands such as Nokia or Sony Ericsson can be easily found in the markets under the names Nckia or Sony Emirson,\" said Sikiandar Ali, a retailer at Eastern Plaza shopping complex.\nDuring visits in city markets, numerous imitations of Nokia cellphones were found to be selling under many different names such as Nckia, Ndikia, Nokai, Inokia, Noka and Nokta.\nSimilarly, fake Sony Eriksson phones were selling under names like Sony Erisom or Song Ericson.\nIn a cellphone store at the Motalib Plaza, a Nokia 6300 mobile set was available at a price of Tk 16,000 while the counterfeit, with identical looks and features, was for sale at a price of only Tk 5,000.\nWhen an original Sony Ericsson Cybershot phone comes at a price of Tk 18,000, the Chinese look-alikes are available for only Tk 8,000 to Tk 10,000.\nMost salesmen refuse to refer to these mobile phones as counterfeits. \"These are Chinese brand products, not counterfeits,\" said Nurul Huque, a mobile phone retailer at Motalib Plaza. \"You can purchase them if you like. If you consider these fakes, than just don't buy them,\" he advised.\nAsked why the prices of the Chinese phones are so low, Huque said Chinese products sell at lower prices everywhere.\nHowever, a number of salesmen admitted that most of these sets are substandard imitation of the major name brands.\n\"The Chinese made mobile phones have very low durability. You may not be able to recharge their batteries after a month or two,\" said Rafique Hossain, a retailer from Basundhara City Complex.\nTo makes matters worse, these cheap mobile phones do not come with any warranty or after sales service.\nCity dwellers alleged that a number of sellers, although promising to provide service warranties during purchase, refuse to take any responsibility of a malfunctioning product later on.\nAccording to mobile phone businessmen, around 70 percent mobile phones available in the markets are counterfeits and are substandard.\n\"About 70 percent, if not more, of mobile phone sets available in the market are imitations of popular brands. These substandard products are taking over the market due to unabated smuggling,\" said Nizam Uddin, president of Bangladesh Mobile Phone Businessmen's' Association.\n\"The widespread availability of counterfeit mobile phones through massive smuggling and customs corruption are actually depriving the government of a huge revenue,\" he added.\nAccording to Russel Mahmud, Manager of Mobile Zone, distributor of Sony Ericsson mobile sets, to be able to distinguish original Sony Ericsson mobile sets, buyers should look for the hologram sticker on the package. He also added that they are planning to launch a mass awareness campaign against fake products."

Six talented rock bands participated in the final. Thrash metal band 'Power Surge' from Dhaka secured the title of the first \"DRockstars band\" of the country.\nThe young musicians of Power Surge have already become quite popular among the young TV viewers in Bangladesh. Characterised by powerful on stage performance, Power Surge says, live shows are an important source of motivation for them.\nAlong with winning the title, Power Surge received a cheque for Tk 5 lakh, an album contract with G series, djuice brand ambassadorship and a membership of BAMBA (Bangladesh Musical Bands Association). Each member of the band also received a Sony Ericsson W880i handset and a new wardrobe from Trendz.\nMore than 600 aspiring rock bands from all over the country took part in the initial selection rounds held at the six divisional cities, over the last four months. Along with Power Surge, Bortoman, Dreek, Dour, Eclipse and Radio Active emerged as the top six bands.\nThousands of text messages and online voting by audiences from both home and abroad selected the winner of DRockstars-2. It should be noted that the proceeds from the SMS will be used for rehabilitation of the flood victims. The total amount raised from the SMS is over Tk 15 lakh.\nGrameenphone's youth brand djuice was the sponsor of the show while BAMBA was the strategic partner of DRockstars-2. Channel-i and Radio Foorti were the media partners and Sony Ericsson was the co-partner of this talent hunt competition. Conceptualised by Bitopi Advertising Ltd, the programme was organised by Spotlight Entertainment Ltd and directed by Red Dot Multimedia Ltd. The grand finale was aired last night at 7:30pm on Channel-i."

Packed liquid milk of some brands available in the market. Photo: Amran Hossain Pran, one of the country's leading food industry groups, is to launch a major initiative in the dairy industry in an attempt to encourage farmers to produce more milk.\nIn what is seen as the first private sector attempt to bring in a co-operative style system into the dairy industry, Pran-RFL Group plans to set up a new organisation,   Bangladesh Dairy Development Company (BDDC). The new body will work closely with farmers to improve cattle breed, assist in vaccinations, feeds and medicine. The group plans to invest Tk 5 crore in BDDC and provide loans to farmers for livestock farming.\nThe Bangladesh milk market has struggled to develop due to low yields caused by a lack of investment in diary farming and in infrastructure such as refrigeration, distribution and packaging facilities.\nCiting examples of India and Pakistan that have a good cooperative structure in dairy farming, Chief Executive Maj Gen Amjad Khan Chowdhury (retd) of the Tk 400-crore Pran-RFL Group told The Daily Star his company would work closely with farmers in greater Pabna, Rajshahi and Rangpur districts in north Bangladesh.\n\"This will help us get milk for our dairy unit and others and simultaneously create jobs in rural areas,\" Chowdhury said.\nPran-RFL is the third largest player in the liquid milk processing market.\n\"BDDC will be a not-for-profit company focused on improving the production of milk at the farm level. Dairy farmers will be helped in all respects,\" he said.\nThe group, which has businesses ranging from food processing to plastic, has taken the initiative at a time when local milk processors are struggling to collect adequate milk to cater to the domestic market, dominated largely by small-scale processors and imports.\nAccording to the department of livestock services, domestic production of milk in the country was 2.27 million tonne in 2005-06, 6 per cent more than the previous year. Added to this 204 million litre of powdered milk was imported.\nChowdhury said the group planned to expand the business to related areas like powdered milk, yogurt and cheese. \"We are hopeful to put all our new products on the market within this year,\" he said. Pran Dairy, at present, has a daily processing capacity of about 1 lakh litres of milk although it only processes about 40,000 litres daily due to milk shortages.\nThe total milk market in Bangladesh is growing at 20 percent a year, according to industry sources.\nAt present, Milk Vita, a dairy brand, produced by government-owned Bangladesh Milk Producers Co-operatives Union Ltd (BMPCUL), controls a majority of the market followed by development organisation BRAC's Aarong brand,  Pran milk and Akij Farm Fresh. BMPCUL has over 1,650 cooperatives and collects milk through 28 chilling centres while BRAC collects milk from farmers through 70 chilling centers.\n\"There are problems in increasing the production of milk. Recurrent flood and a rise in feed prices are affecting the farming,\" said a BMPCUL senior official, who did not wish to be quoted. BMPCUL also produces powdered milk, ice-cream and sweets, and is keen to expand its network across the country.\n\"There is huge demand. But production is not increasing. That's why imports are growing every year,\" said Mohammad Ali, who handles BRAC's Dairy and Food Project.sohel@thedailystar.net"

      "headline": "Detail Area Plan (DAP) of Dhaka: Shattering the vision of DMDP",
      "authors": "\nBangladesh Institute of Planners\n",
      "text": "   Photo: E-businessbangladesh.net Dhaka will be the second largest megacity by the year 2015. This mega city is the hub of commerce, administration and industries of Bangladesh. It is accommodating about 37% of total urban population of the country. A large share of the huge population belongs to poor and middle income groups.\nThis city is growing primarily in a spontaneous manner. The first plan for the city was prepared in 1959. In 1997, Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan (DMDP) was approved and provided the planning policy guideline for Dhaka. DMDP was a three tier plan  the first tier is the Structure Plan, which stated all the policies regarding the development of Dhaka till 2015. The ongoing Detail Area Plan (DAP) is the third tier of DMDP. DAP, as the lowest tier, must comply with the policies stated in DMDP Structure Plan.\nRAJUK appointed four consulting firms to prepare the DAP. Recently the consultants submitted the draft proposals of DAP to RAJUK. The process of public hearing on the plan has been criticized by various professionals, environmentalist and civil society groups. Representatives from Bangladesh Institute of Planners (BIP), members from academia and civil society attended some of the meetings arranged by RAJUK. Most of the participants observed that there were contradictions in the approach to the proposed plan and pointed out various issues which would jeopardize environment and social goals of the city. Considering the importance of the plan in the national context, BIP, Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon (BAPA), Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA), Institute of Architects Bangladesh (IAB) and Centre for Urban Studies (CUS) organized a press conference to highlight the shortcomings of the proposed DAP. In addition BIP formed a review committee to review the proposed plan. The committee found that there is gross violation of national laws and DMDP. If the plan is implemented in its present form it would not only endanger the well being of future generation but also create social unrest and environmental disaster to Dhaka.\nRAJUK did not conduct any study to calculate land-use requirement for the DMDP area. As a result individual consultants did not get any comprehensive guideline from RAJUK and failed to meet the actual land-use demand of city dwellers. The project director of DAP was requested to provide a comprehensive land-use data to review the status of land-use allocation to different land-use categories. But it was surprising to know that RAJUK does not have any such compiled data for entire Dhaka Metro Area. It seems that consultants only focused on their specific locations. It is assumed that RAJUK would provide standards for public land-use categories for Dhaka. Although there are many technical and conceptual problems in the plan, the following major issues require due attention to save Dhaka from further deterioration:Legal AspectDAP has been conducted to fulfil the obligation of Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan (DMDP). It is a legal document (SRO No. 184- law/97 dated 3rd August, 1997). It is not legal to violate DMDP. As the lowest tier of DMDP, DAP must conform to policies stated in DMDP Structure and Urban Area Plan. The BIP Review Committee identified some gross violation of DMDP policies in the proposed DAP. Following are some of the major examples:\n*\tAccording to DMDP, there are two categories of Flood Flow Zones: (i) Main Flood Flow and (ii) Sub-flood Flow Zone. But in the proposed DAP, there is no category as \"sub-flood flow zone\". This change of land-use category is a gross violation of DMDP.\n*\tAccording to DMDP Structure plan, \"agricultural land\" is classified into two categories: \"High Value Agricultural Land\" and \"Agricultural land\". It is surprising to see that DAP proposed only one category of agricultural land, labelled as: \"Agriculture with Rural Homestead\". This certainly make us curious why this change has occurred which would put the agricultural land under threat of encroachment. We are afraid that this change would create scope for the private land development companies to extend urban uses in the valuable agricultural land.\n*\tIn addition to violation of DMDP policy, proposed land uses within flood flow zones are also contradictory to the following acts:\n*\tWater Body Conservation Act 2000\n*\tBangladesh Environment Conservation Act 1995\n*\tAlso violating the obligation to RAMSAR Convention of which Bangladesh is a signatory.Flood Flow and DrainageJICA in its report on Flood Action Plan for Dhaka (FAP-8A and FAP-8B), identified main and sub-flood flow zones. The DMDP Structure Plan adopted the policies stated in JICA reports. Following are the flood Zone Policies of DMDPFLOOD ZONE POLICY RS/3- FLOOD-FLOW ZONESLand development, within the designated flood plain areas of the DMDP Structure Plan, will be controlled in order to avoid obstructions to flood flow, which might otherwise result in adverse hydraulic effects, such as, the rise of flood water levels and change in flow direction.Main Flood Flow ZoneLand Development for residential, commercial and industrial development including raising the level of land via land filling will strictly be prohibited.\nPermitted uses, provided that they cause no adverse hydraulic effect will be:\n*\tAgriculture\n*\tDry season recreation facilities\n*\tFerry terminals; and\n*\tExcavation of mineral deposits, including dry season brick works.\nCauseways for roads or railways will be permitted, subject to detailed geological surveys being undertaken and on condition that they are built with culverts sufficient to allow for unimpeded flood flow.Sub flood Flow ZoneDevelopment compatible with the rural nature of these mainly rice growing areas, will be permitted on condition that the: \n*\tStructures are built on stilt, or on land raised above design flood water level.\n*\tAlignment of structures and raised land to be designed so as not to disturb flood flow.POLICY RS/5  FLOOD RETENTION PONDSControl will be maintained over the areas designated in the DMDP Structure Plan for flood retention ponds in order to ensure that they remain capable of fulfilling their primary function of water storage at times of flooding. The use of the land within designated pond areas to be restricted to the following activities: \n* Agriculture;\n*\tFish cultivation and\n*\tRecreation.\nIt is unfortunate to see the way the proposals of DAP contradicts with the flood zone policies of DMDP. Most part of sub-flood flow zone has been designated as \"urban residential zone\" and \"agriculture with rural homestead category\" in the proposed DAP. Even in main flood flow zones, proposal for \"urban residential zone\" and \"agriculture with rural homestead\" category is evident. DAP has followed the drainage proposals of Halcrow (2006) where much less amount of retention pond areas has been suggested compared to JICA study (1992). Considering the climate change scenario and increased intensity of rainfall within short duration, Dhaka has become more vulnerable to rain induced flood (Alam and Rabbani, 2007). In such a context, it raises question why the Halcrow (2006) study has been followed by the DAP consultants. It was expected that the consultants would conduct their own study to determine the size and location of retention pond areas and drainage network in Dhaka. JICA proposal designated 12% of total land area as retention ponds whereas DAP proposes only 5.05% of total embankment area of Dhaka. Findings of Halcrow (2006) study were widely criticized by different professional and environmentalist groups. It is surprising to see that the sites of proposed \"retention ponds\" in some locations have already been filled up by the developers. It is claimed by the consultants that no more low-lying land is available in the eastern fringe area. However our studies find out that there is considerable amount of land available in the area. Before finalizing the proposed DAP, it is essential to review the size and location of retention areas very cautiously. Otherwise, it would be difficult to control adverse impact of rain flood in future. Smaller retention areas will need higher capacity of pumps and thus more dependency on electricity. Even after large-scale illegal encroachment of low-lying land in the eastern fringe, it is still possible to designate higher percentage of retention pond areas there.Agricultural LandIn modern town planning approach, urban agriculture is highly emphasized to meet the food demand of urban population and limiting the size of ecological footprint. DMDP stated policies to conserve agricultural land to ensure a base for urban food supplies in close proximity to the city and to improve income levels within the agricultural sector of the metropolitan area's economy. DAP paid no attention to this. As a result vast swathes of fertile agricultural lands are proposed to be converted to urban residential and mixed-use development. In several locations, agricultural land category of DMDP has been replaced by \"urban residential use\" category in DAP maps without any rational explanation. It is surprising to notice that \"High Value Agricultural Land\" and \"Agricultural land\" category of DMDP have been replaced by \"Agriculture with Rural Homestead\" land-use category. This change of classification would create opportunity for land speculation by private developers and individuals, and would displace rural folks from their homestead.Residential Area It is a known fact that Dhaka does not have housing stock to accommodate 15 million people but it should be kept in mind that majority of the population of Dhaka belongs to middle and low income group who as no access to housing market. It was the pre-requisite of DAP to determine land requirement for residential land-use for different income groups up to the year 2015. But unfortunately DAP failed to address the housing requirements of poor and middle income groups. Instead it encouraged development of high income residential area of Gulshan by acquiring low-middle income area of BaddaMerul. The proposed DAP unnecessarily allocated huge amount of land for residential use to accommodate the desires of vested interest groups jeopardizing the environmental and social equity goals of the city. This would eventually lead to land speculation and social discrimination. None of the DAP reports provided any strategies/tools to control land speculation and regulate development.\nIn last 10 years, Private Land development Companies have illegally encroached huge amount of flood flow zones, retention areas, agricultural lands for housing projects. These unapproved projects are not identified by the DAP consultants (though these information was readily available) in their reports while they discussed about existing land-use scenario of the study areas. But the proposed DAP has accommodated all these illegal projects by changing land-use categories specified in the DMDP. For example \"Jhilmil housing project\" by RAJUK and Pangaon Container Port at Keranigonj, Modhumati Model Town and many other housing projects do not conform to DMDP as these are located in Sub-Flood Flow Zones.\nThe review committee feels that both consultant and RAJUK over emphasized the importance of residential use.  the proposed allocation of residential area in DAP could accommodate more than 38 million people with nominal density of 187 people/acre which is more than double of projected population up to year 2015. The irrational approach of the consultant to major share of the land to residential use will only serve the purpose of vested interest groups.Open SpaceOpen space is the lungs of any city. It is already recognized that Dhaka has lack of open space which has negative impact on public health, ecology and society. The plan failed to realize the need of the society. If the proposed plan is executed there would be only 0.328 acres of land/1000 population which is far below than any other densely populated cities of the world. The necessity of open recreational space can easily be understood when we see the pressure of population in Ramna Park and Dhanmondi Lake area .The plan proposed only one third of the land as open space after proposed relocation of Central Jail. We feel that this is inadequate and would be grabbed by vested quarter as the rest of it demarcated as residential and commercial use. The vacant area must be designated as city scale open space to meet the critical demand of residents of old Dhaka.ConclusionMany anomalies have been found during micro-level analysis of Detail Planning Zone (DPZ) of DAP. It was difficult to comprehend detail map provided in the reports in many cases while compared with composite DAP map. In some cases inconsistency is visible between detail map (DPZ) and composite DAP map. Even the legends used by different consultants vary considerably. There are also problems regarding the scale of the maps.\nIn conclusion we like to draw attention on few more aspects which require careful investigation.\nIt seems that transportland-use interaction was not viewed comprehensively. Though a large segment of the population is pedestrian and dependent on non-motorized transport (NMT) but no specific programmes are proposed to develop and improve facilities for pedestrians and NMT. Some radical suggestions (like Shifting of Sadarghat goods terminal to Pagla, central truck terminal in Rampura) raised questions regarding the justifications in terms of cost and their impacts on transportation system.\nWater supply is a crucial issue for a mega city like Dhaka. The city is primarily dependent on groundwater though surrounded by rivers all around. Due to gradual depletion of groundwater level, it is necessary to undertake necessary action to secure prevailing sources of surface water and to encourage rainwater harvesting. But no such direction is evident in the proposed DAP.\nWe must remember Dhaka has a glorious past of four hundred years as a capital city. The city was blessed with water bodies and greeneries. Over the years, spontaneous unplanned development took place due to the negligence and ignorance of the regulating authority. But the proposed DAP failed to address the critical issues for sustainable development of Dhaka. It is apprehended that if DAP is approved without significant corrections and modification so as to adhere to the Structure Plan proposals, land speculation and land development by private developers will cause immense harm to Dhaka's environment. We strongly suggest that a technical committee comprising of relevant professionals and representatives from the civil society organizations should be entrusted with the task of reviewing DAP in the light of DMDP policies and recommending measures for DAP's corrections/modifications/ improvement.References:"

Taking illegal help from government officials groups of influential people including a section of dishonest businessmen are involved in illegal hill cutting, sources said.\nIn Khagrachhari, hill cutting is a common sight at Shalban, Comilla Tila, Sabujbag, Panchmile area, Zia Naghor, Boghiroth Para, Rashiknagor, Jamtali, Maischhari, Maidda Karallachhari, Bichitala, Kengalchhari, Tongthakpara, Khagrapur, Kamalchhari, Bhuachhari, Golabari, Laxmichhari, Ramghor, Matiranga, Khagrachhari College Para area, Tetultala and No-1 Kadamtali area.\nSeveral government establishments are now dangerously exposed to collapse during the rainy season due to the hill cutting.\nLocal environmental activists and journalists filed several general diaries with police stations in Khagrachhari hill district in regard to hill cutting. But the administration is taking minor initiative to protect the hills from depletion.\nBangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela) issued legal notice to secretaries of three ministries for taking immediate actions against the plunderers of hills in last year, sources said. The ministries are environment and forest, land and public works.\nIn last year, Bela also issued notice to divisional commissioner of Chittagong, deputy commissioner of Khagrachhari, environment departments in Dhaka and Chittagong, SP of Khagrachhari and UNO of Dighinala upazilla in this regard.\nIn Khagrachhari hill district, this syndicate employs a number of day labourers in hill cutting in different areas in the districts paying Tk 150 to 200 per day as wages. Plunders always cutting hill which created bad impact for the environment, It damaged property, lives, filled up river, canals, create flash flood in the areas, said Abu Daud Muhammad, Member Secretary of local organisation 'Parivesh Surokkha Andolon'.\nChenghi and Mainee rivers in the district have become filthy due to hill erosion, local journalist and environment worker Omar Faruk Shamim said.\n\"We have recently submitted a proposal to district administration to save water bodies and hills,\" he said.\nThe unscrupulous businessmen supply hilly soil to fill up canals and low lands for constructing houses and markets in the districts and as well as Chittagong city and its adjacent areas, said Mohammad Khalilur Rahman, secretary of Parivesh Andolon Forum.\n\"Soil supply has become a profitable business among the hill cutters as they need only a little investment for a huge profit. A truck of hilly soil is sold at Tk 700-1000, said Tazul Islam, a truck driver from Bazar area under Sadar upazila in Khagrachhari district.\nHill cutting causes landslides in rainy season in eight upazilas in Khagrachhari hill district which decreasing soil fertility and damaging life and property in the districts, said Khagrachhari Additional Deputy Commissioner Masud Ahmed.\nDivisional Forest Officer Ali Kabir said, many hilly areas are facing an unexpected danger, at any time any accident would might happened causing harm for people and properties. An integrated approach is necessary for saving environment of natural hilly areas, he said.\nWhen contacted, Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Shahdat Hossen said he has taken many initiatives to save hills. He has already formed a six-member committee to survey actually how many people are vulnerable in the district. His officials filed at least 21 cases against hill plunders and four people are in jail now, he said.\n\"I have sent show cause notice to many people including government organisation Roads and Highways Department to explain why they have been cutting hill without permission from Department of Environment.

      "text": "   Our CitiesThere is no denying of the fact that urbanization is the inevitable destiny of the human civilization. But, the way cities, both at home and abroad, are growing is not at all sustainable. Therefore it is imperative that governments across the globe should fundamentally rethink policies and approaches towards managing urbanization before it is too late. To be true, \"we have ten, maybe fifteen years, to get on to a new track. After that the slum problem, environmental damage and urban insecurity will become so entrenched that they will dominate international relations for the rest of the century\", says Planner Christine Platt, President, Commonwealth Association of Planners (CAP). WTPD gives an opportunity to \"advance public and professional interest in planning both locally and abroad\" and create \"a special day to recognize and promote the role of planning in creating livable communities.\" WTPD recognizes community-wide needs, the significance of neighborhood and centre, the need for personal involvement in community policy making, the fragile nature of the environment, and the necessity to consider future impacts in community and regional development for the present and the future.\nHere in Bangladesh, one of the fastest urbanizing countries in the developing countries, living in urban areas is not at all a different experience than it is anywhere else in the world. For instance, in the morning when parents drop their children at school on their way to work they do not find any public or private transport. After dropping their kids they have to travel to the other parts of the city as the transport and land uses are not integrated. Before they reach their workplace they have to overcome traffic jams, inhale polluted air and suffer deafening noise.\nIn the city, electricity and water supply is not ensured, quality is a far cry. The poor are the worst sufferers and they are further exposed to diseases due to poor sanitation. Yet they cannot replace the unhygienic latrines, if any, in their shanties. Open dustbins on roadsides overflow with garbage. Roads and drains go under knee-deep water not only in monsoon but also after a sudden shower.\nThe housing shortage is so acute that one third of the city's population lives in slums. Parks and open spaces are gradually disappearing. The influx of migrants from rural areas and deprived towns continues. The city authorities can neither respond to the problems nor coordinate their work.\nAlthough the above is the picture of capital Dhaka, the other cities are not faring any better. The problems are particularly acute in coastal cities where the growing threats from rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions are not matched by growing capacity to plan and manage settlements in sustainable and equitable ways. Because the poor live in the most hazardous locations they are disproportionately vulnerable to the local impacts of climate change.Our Pledges and FailureAlthough Bangladesh has already made important gains in the fight against poverty, till now the principal goal of the Bangladesh Government's economic policy remains poverty alleviation because aggregate poverty rate remain dauntingly high. Pockets of extreme poverty persist in several cities, villages and regions. In fact, according to experts, poverty is a broad front. It is about income levels, food security, quality of life, asset bases, human resource capacities, vulnerabilities and coping. It also entails gender inequalities, human security and initiative horizons. It is each of these and all of these together.\nBeing a signatory to the declarations of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) -- a renewed commitment of the global community at the United Nations General Assembly 2000 to overcome persistent poverty and address many of the most enduring failures of human development, Bangladesh is bound to achieve the following eight goals by 2015:  (i) Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, (ii) Achieve universal primary education, (iii) Promote gender equality and empower women, (iv) Reduce child mortality, (v) Improve maternal health, (vi) Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, (vii) Ensure environmental sustainability, and (viii) Develop a Global Partnership for Development.\nWhile many of the targets set under these goals are related to urbanization and urban living, those under goal number seven directly affect urban growth, housing and environmental management. These targets are as follows-  (7a) integrate the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programmes; reverse loss of environmental resources, (7b) Reduce by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and (7c) Achieve significant improvement in lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2020.\nApart from MDGs the national vision statement 'Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)' of the Government of Bangladesh has also many components (including infrastructure provisioning, electricity and water supply, disaster management, other than poverty alleviation and income generation) which are someway or other related to safe and sustainable urbanization and urban growth.\nAs regards Bangladesh's progress toward the MDGs and achieving PRSP objectives, the country is seemingly on the right track in many of the aspects. Notwithstanding the progress in social MDGs, there are two emerging concerns as expressed in PRSP. They are:\nFirst, a high degree of social inequality, which cuts across all the key social targets.\nSecond, the rich-poor divide (however measured) is striking, but more worrying is the gap between the poorest and the rest of the society.\nGiven the association between growth, inequality and poverty, it is important to understand the extent and dimensions of inequality in order to devise strategies for poverty reduction. Several features are noted in PRSP:\nFirst, the income distribution situation has changed in a major way since the early nineties. The Gini coefficient for urban areas has shot up from 0.33 in 1991/92 to 0.44 in 2000. Similarly, the rural Gini has increased from 0.27 to 0.36 during the same period. (Please remember that Gini value '0' represents no disparity and '1' means highest).\nSecond, rising income (consumption expenditure) inequality has reduced the poverty reducing potentials. Had the urban growth rate during the 1991/92 and 2000 period been distribution neutral, the incidence of urban poverty would have fallen by 13% instead of 7%, or almost twice the actual observed rate. Similarly, the incidence of rural poverty would have dropped by 12% instead of 9%. The factor of growing inequality thus emerges as a more important concern for the urban areas.\nPlanned Urbanization: Vision 2020 and Panacea for Development and Sustainability\nBy the year 2020, on the 50th year of our independence, total urban population in Bangladesh will increase up to 50 million (five crores) from 30 million now. And around half of them will be attracted or compelled to live in Dhaka and its conurbations alone unless a careful and well-thought-out urbanization policy is undertaken and implemented. This huge population in Dhaka will on the one hand make living in city a horrible experience, and on the other hand such an enormous and all devouring growth of Dhaka will act as a barrier against the soundly distributed urban growth throughout the country.\nThus, all our efforts for (economic) growth and better quality of life for the mass people will remain the usual (day) dream. On a fine (!) morning we will find that even after making some progress in overall poverty reduction endeavour we have opened many other emerging problem fronts like rural-urban divide, urbanization of poverty, etc. along with traditional urban problems.\nRecently, supplying food to the urban dwellers has also become a burning concern. And we will find many such issues or problems faced by people of different strata in the society and raised in different platforms. We are sure even then we will be trying to solve the problems in some ad-hoc and uncoordinated approach, as done nowadays. In fact the traditional 'sectoral development planning approach' is bound to generate such byproducts which offset the success achieved in other fronts.\nIn such an ever-tightening dilemma, well-devised and professionally-handled planning (urban and regional) can go a long way not only in solving the problems of housing, transport and utility infrastructures, and water supply and sanitation, but also of poverty, growth and environment.\n\"Urban growth is going to be huge in this generation. It will create a great wealth that can lift people out of poverty. However, we have to get the cities right, and that needs smart planning\", said Christine Platt, who recently visited India to see how they are handling the urban consequences of an economic boom. So our vision should be Planned Urbanization. However the panacea is not cheap at all. We should at least undertake the following measures.Regional Consideration in Urban PlanningIn developing countries urbanization is not only an indicator of development, but ironically an outcome of abject poverty and joblessness in rural and marginal urban centres. Therefore, only urbanization will not serve the objectives of reducing or eliminating urban problems like slums and squatter settlements, congestion in roads, supply failure in housing, water, transport and infrastructures, depletion of parks and open spaces, etc. Planning must be done to distribute the demand in the surrounding urban centres and also for providing required facilities there.\nToday here in Bangladesh migration is the prime source of urban population growth particularly in the major urban centres. So, to retard pressure on urban system/infrastructure, both push and pull factors of urbanization are to be considered. On the one hand we have to make employment, facilities (health, education, recreation, etc), utilities (gas, electricity, water, etc), infrastructure (housing, transport) etc. available to the people in the villages, or at least to the citizens of upazila and district towns. On the other hand we have to make cost of haphazard practice and development excessively charged in large and alluring urban areas (particularly Dhaka) to reduce the pressure on rampant urbanization.Consideration of spatial implication of sector based (economic) development planning Integration of both sectoral and spatial plans is a long overdue in Bangladesh. Although consideration of spatial implication of sectoral/economic planning decisions could, firstly, help the decision makers to distribute the investment in a more equitable basis and thus to generate more economies and positive externalities, ultimately, compared to that generated from the current trend of regional/urban biasness in investment trends. Therefore, Spatial Impact Assessment (SIA) of all the large scale, multi-sectoral projects taken by the government, donors, private sectors, and NGOs should be made mandatory.Urbanization policy and compact development to save agricultural landCurrently we do not have a policy for urbanization in the country. Dhaka has become excessively large and an unmanageable city, and has started to experience huge diseconomies of scale. On the other hand, Khulna, a vibrant industrial city in the Pakistan period and even two decades back, is facing deurbanization. Similar is true for other metropolitan cities and divisional towns. Again, there is enormous need and scope for creating more jobs, business opportunities, health and education facilities and redistributing/accommodating unnecessary and extra-large administrative bodies of the government functionaries to divisional, district and upazila towns. Thus urbanization policy must be formulated with recommendations for hierarchical urbanization in the country.\nIt should also include recommendations for arresting sporadic and haphazard urban growth and indiscriminate conversion of agricultural land to other uses. Currently, Bangladesh is losing agricultural land at a gross rate of 2% per year. Again population is still increasing at a faster rate. Moreover, inflow of foreign remittance is causing rapid land speculation in urban peripheries and rural areas and land purchased is most often used for anything other than agriculture. Since these establishments (residential or business) are developed sporadically and unplanned, during the rainy season they either become vulnerable to flooding or obstruct recession of water. Therefore, to ensure land for agricultural production, to prevent land speculation and to facilitate more cost-effective provisioning of heath and other facilities, electricity and other utilities, flood protection measures with compact (urban) land use development should be a priority objective.Integrated land use development in urban areasAll the urban areas in the hierarchy of the national urban policy should have land use plan in the form of structure (strategic) plan, detail area plan and special local area plan. Concerned development authority of the metropolitan areas (like RAJUK, CDA, RDA, KDA), or local paurashavas, or any special department of the government will be solely responsible and adequately strengthened to prepare the plans.\nDesign and distribution of urban land uses should be such that it should necessitate less vehicular commuting. Citizens should be able to do their daily regular activities (shopping, schooling, accessing primary, even secondary, health care, recreation and sports, etc.) within a walking distance. A large number of the primary and school-going children in the capital Dhaka use private/office vehicles for going to school, while another significant number use rickshaw, public buses, etc. This practice not only causes enormous pressure on the city transport system, but also causes excess and unnecessary commuting by the accompanying persons, wastage of time, tiredness of the children, etc. So, elementary and secondary schooling should be zone/area based. Regulations should be formulated so that no elementary school can admit students outside the ward in which it is located and no secondary school can admit students outside the thana in which it is located. It will also stop mushroom growth of educational institutions in a single locality (Dhanmondi for example) and would create a competition among the existent institutions to increase the quality of education.\nTo reduce vehicular travel, demand facilities and use-needs like post offices, supermarkets, community centres, dispensaries and small clinics, small scale markets or one stop shops and such facilities should be distributed, and only permitted near or around a bus stop within a maximum of 15-30 minutes of walk.\nIt may be proposed, for instance, that before permitting any building on a site of 15 katha, Traffic Impact Study (TIA) should be made mandatory to calculate the extra traffic generated for the development. If the development increases the traffic volume by more than 5% in the adjacent road or one percent in the nearby collector road the developer should pay at least one percent of the total construction cost to the government as charge to offset road users miseries added, and as a discouragement to such practice.Transport infrastructure in urban areas Water and rail transport should be introduced and used to reduce pressure on the road transport. Waterways should be properly linked with the existing road networks. In all the growing cities the tendency of the authority is to relocate the central bus and rail terminals repeatedly after every 20-30 years. Rather than doing so, whenever the need for relocation is felt, authorities should start thinking about development of underground establishments including terminals and road/rail networks. It will not only reduce the congestion on the ground in the future and save the cost of relocation, but will also save the cost of relocation of business activities and  help the authority towards optimum allocation of land uses and its strict application and execution.\nPolicies should be streamlined for all the cities, irrespective of size and hierarchy, to restrict the use of private vehicles. It will not only reduce traffic jam, but also facilitate compact development of the city (as opposed to linear and sporadic one occupying valuable agricultural land), save a huge amount of fuel which is going to be more costly in the near future and make operation of subway economically feasible.Land taxation and checking land speculation in urban areasUnder the current land taxation structure building house on a piece of land is more tax burdensome than keeping it vacant. Therefore, land speculation is encouraged and consequently supply of land for the real land seekers is enormously constrained and supply of housing has more seriously fallen short in metropolitan areas. Thus, there is an urgent need of restructuring urban land taxation, making vacant land ownership excessive costly to reduce the demandsupply gap. Again, city development agencies (RAJUK, CDA, KDA, RDA, etc) and real estate companies should also be prevented from land speculation and plot business. Aggressive profit-only motive of private developers in collusion with private banks or credit supplying institutions should be monitored to prevent any inflationary boom leading to financial depression.\nRetaining canals and water bodies, and reducing water logging\nIn the land use plan, great care should be taken so that flood-retention points, wetland and canals are saved and used unharmed by temporary/seasonal users. Canals encroached by residential, business or even by the government authorities should be identified and reclaimed, and any future occupation should be penalized exemplarily. To prevent pollution of the water bodies and keeping them usable for recreation or other compatible purposes, no storm water outlets should be permitted in these.Less electricity and water using building and green oriented regulationsBuilding regulations and zoning provision should consider, along with privacy, comfort, daylight and air circulation, the electricity consumption and heat generation (development of Heat Islands  i.e. pocket areas of excess temperature in the summer). Urban electricity supply authority must make solar panel installation mandatory for high-rise buildings. Moreover, setback rules and Floor Area Ratio (FAR) considerations of building construction rules should make tree plantation in all setback areas mandatory and provide incentives to encourage adherence to it. At least half the setback area should be kept as water-absorbent green, where grass may grow.\nSuch measures will help reduce heat generation and electricity consumption in residential areas during summer and enrich the ground water level by recharging rainwater in the monsoon. Apart from these, buildings should also be encouraged to harvest rainwater in the wet season. For all these measures, electricity, water providing agencies and city corporations or paurashavas should provide effectively calculated waiver in the total utility fees or tax, etc.Planning : Professional Vs. Amateurism Finally, it should be stated that planned urbanization as a panacea will not be achieved even if only the stated measures are undertaken without deciding who are going to oversee the process. We need a quantum leap in management capacity: more trained people with better skills, and planning legislation that is fit for the purpose in today's world. Too often, even in developed countries, the approach of governments to urban development (carried out by amateur planners, in fact bureaucrats and administrators) is one of curative medicine: too little too late in environmental protection. Planning is proactively providing preventative medicine by professional planners. It's about acting now so that our cities and rural areas are not allowed to degrade to the extent that recovery becomes a prohibitive cost.\nSo there is a need to reinvent planning. It is important to recognize the good work that goes on in planning, and just as important to let the outside world know the good things planners do and the positive role planners play in local communities across the country. WTPD can provide an opportunity to recognize, celebrate and educate professional planning instead of traditional ad-hoc amateur planning."

      "headline": "Korotoa: Tale of a dying river",
      "authors": "\nNazrul Islam\n",
      "text": "   Photo: Tanvir Ahmed/Drik news I have an intrinsic love for rivers and water-bodies since I was brought up in a rural area, which once had an abundance of water-bodies and rivers. As I grew up, I, however, saw the gradual vanishing of the water-bodies and drying up of the rivers.\nA year back, I had taken a plan to document the past glories and present dismal condition of some of the moribund rivers on video camera. One day I, along with my camera and an assistant, went out to the river Korotoa in my home district Bogra.\nThe Korotoa originated from the Himalayas, the mother of numerous rivers. Originating from northern frontier of Bhutan, the Korotoa enters Bangladesh territory through Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri districts of West Bengal in India, taking the flows of various rivers.\nOnce, there was a single Korotoa. It lost its path during the devastating flood in the Teesta in 1887. At one point, it divided into five branches. One of the branches is Rangpur Korotoa, which originates from low-lying areas of Nilphamari district. Its main flow descended in the river Bangalee near Govindaganj of Gaibandha district. The other branch, originating from the river Bangalee, flows through Bogra and is known as Bogra Korotoa.\nThere are many myths centring the Korotoa. The Korotoa had emerged from the water that was dropped on the hands of Lord Shiva during his wedding with Parvati. Another myth says the Korotoa comes from the milk of the deity Parvati.\nThere are many anecdotes, and folk stories about the Korotoa. The legendary craft of Behula-Lakshindar was floated on the Korotoa River. We don't know how far the craft of the ancient tale had travelled, but the said \"bridegroom\" of Behula-Lakshindar still prevails in Bogra. The myth of the bridegroom remains as a myth.\nThousands of villages, towns and commercial places like Shibganj, Mohasthangarh, Bogra and Sherpur have been built on both sides of the Korotoa along its 200-kilometres path. Mohasthangarh, the capital of ancient Pundranagar, is still there beside the Korotoa as a witness of history.\nThe district town of Bogra is situated beside the Korotoa. The town was upgraded to a district town in 1850. The name of the district has been given after the name of Sultan Nasiruddin Bogra Khan, the second son of Giasuddin Balban, the Sultan of Delhi from 1281 to 1290.\nThe once mighty Korotoa is now a narrow water flow. Over the centuries, the Korotoa is not only lost its water flow due to various natural causes but most of its parts on both sides have also been encroached.\nWe rached Bogra from Dhaka at noon. After a brief rest and light refreshment, we went to the Korotoa rail-bridge. The Bogra district headquarters has been built on the Korotoa, which flows through the heart of the town.\nThe town is growing in an unplanned manner. The drainage and sewerage system is very poor. Dirty water of hundreds of drains falls in the Korotoa. There was no flow of water under the railway-bridge. A patch of water exists there, but it looks like tar.\nWe found a fisherman catching fish in this dirty water. The fisherman, Tota Mia, who has been living on fishing throughout his life, told us that most of the fishermen deserted their profession as it is hard to live on the meagre catch in the almost dead Korotoa. We also found that people were bathing and washing their clothes in the dirty water.\nWe moved to the south and crossed the river near jail gate over a bamboo bridge. Every river has its natural boundary, which immediately tells us that this is its limit. Here we found that not only individuals, but also private organisations and government bodies hadn't spared Korotoa from encroachment.\nAs the adage goes, \"the river erodes this side but builds on the other.\" But neither bank of the Korotoa either erodes or builds. Both banks have fallen to the greed of people.\nWhen the river should flow through, devouring and building, we found that a silent Korotoa was gradually and continuously shrinking, and it's difficult to recognise it at many points.\nNot only were concrete structures, bridges, bazaars, gardens and roads constructed by encroaching on the Korotoa, farming is also going on in the heart of the river. We found two huge bridges situated on the dried-up Korotoa near Matidali, some 10-km south of the town.\nOne of the bridges was constructed to connect a road leading to the village home of President Ziaur Rahman, and the other to connect the newly built second bypass road. Here the river is almost disappearing. Looking from the bridge, we found only paddy fields in the low-lying area.\nNext day, we decided to go upstream to see whether the river still flowed in abundance anywhere throughout its path. Following the zigzag path of Korotoa, we reached Shibganj upazila headquarters, some 25 km off the Bogra town.\nRivers in Bangladesh are not only flowing water; rather rivers are a part of our culture, and heritage. Here we found crystal-clear water after crossing a Hindu temple under a huge banyan tree.\nThe Korotoa seemed to have revived here. There was no sewerage, no filth. A flock of ducks was swimming, disturbing the nearly still water. But the river was not spared here also. After going further north of the upazila headquarters, the river vanished again into low-lying areas covered by lush green paddy fields. Only a few small patches of water were seen at places.\nThere were a number of branches of the Korotoa. Two such branches are the Nagar and the Gangloi, originating in Shibganj upazila. The entry point of the Nagar from the Korotoa was almost closed, and concrete buildings were constructed at the mouth.\nA small culvert, that still exists, is the only proof that the Nagar once originated from the Korotoa. Neither branch here gets water from the source as the Korotoa itself suffers from water scarcity almost 9 months in the year.\nDespite its bad shape, the Korotoa is still a source of irrigation water at places where it holds waters. Not a long time back, when most of the irrigation water came from rivers in Bangladesh. But gone are those days. The rivers are drying up and farmers now fetch water from underground, which has a disastrous effect on ecology and environment.\nWe talked to many people in the vicinity of the river. Many elderly people told us that they saw huge merchant boats plying in the river throughout the year when they were young. Bogra was well connected with other districts through the Korotoa, turning it into a centre of commerce in the northern region long ago.\nI returned to the town in the afternoon in a pensive mood. The sorry state of the river raised a number of questions in my mind: Would Korotoa cease to exist? Will the river, which had flowed for centuries, die within a few years? Would the river, which bears so many historical and mythological memories, vanish within a single lifetime?\nWhen we approached journalist Samudra Haq, he lamented: \"We ... human beings have destroyed and are still destroying our rivers. Korotoa is not an exception. But one thing we should remember: if there is no river, there will be no civilisation,\" Samudra Haq commented. What do you think readers?"

      "authors": "\nAshraful Alam\n",
      "text": "   How suitable are species other than Sal? Bhawal National Park is located at 2401/ N latitude and 90020/ E longitude, about 40 km N of Dhaka on the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway, encloses a gazette notified area of 5,022 ha (inclusive of 584 ha transferred for army and air force bases), and is under the territorial jurisdiction of Dhaka forest division. The park was established by the forest department in 1974 and formally published in gazette(1982) to protect the near complete depletion of vegetative cover and wildlife in the area as well as to halt the process of acquisition of land for other purposes because of its close proximity to Dhaka. There are both privately area of 950 ha within the gazette notified national park area which is divided into recreational zone and a protection zone. There are about 202 ha of private land in the identified core area and about 650 people live within this core area.Forests under forestry use The Hill forests contribute 508,991 ha (45.4%) followed by the littoral mangrove forests and coastal aforestation extending over 489,872 ha (43.7%) and plain Sal forest account for the rest 121,884 ha (10.9%) of the forest area.The share of forest land in total national area during 1970 remained 15 percent and fell to about 14 percent during 1980 and slipped further to about 13 percent during 1990.Public forest lands account for about 14.9 percent and the village forests for anther 1.8 percent of the area of the country.\n\tThe depleted forest within the gazette notified national park has recovered to a considerable extent now and is nearly a pure stand of 15-20 old Sal which is of uniform height and occupies almost 100 percent of the canopy. The under storied vegetation is low and relatively open and contains relatively few species. The Sal trees are, however, short, of small diameter and of poor form and because of low vigour of the coppices, is not expected to grow much more.\nBhawal Sal forest of Gazipur is tropical moist deciduous type of forests. Actually this forest is present in lowland and flood plain based area. In our country only very this forest contains pure sal. Because the natural and climatic condition of this region is very much suitable for growing pure Sal tree. Besides this forest contains a huge variety of floral composition. Moreover different types of mammals, reptile, aves, amphibian depends on these kinds of trees, as their habitat as well as niche.\nThe scenario of the sal forest was quite good couple of years back. But at present the forest faces a miserable condition. There are many reasons for depletion of the resources. From the study the following causes were found: Human settlement, Industrialization Agricultural activities, Logging, Cattle ranching, Brick field, Saw mills, Encroachment, Fragmentation of forest land by road construction, Existing population pressure, other usage.\nOnce upon a time Bhawal Garh was so rich and transitional zone of floral composition because of its geographical settings and climatic characteristics. Sal was the special but recently  Bahera, Amloki, Gandhi gazari, Karoi Palash, Dhaki-jaam, Chambal, Bajna, Haritaki, Sonalu, Mango, Jack-fruit trees are planted here. This forest also includes lower amounts of Herbs, Shrubs, Grasses, Creepers and Vines. Deer, Owl, Wild cock, Cobra, Frog, Cockroach, Monkey, Rat, Python, Doeal, Cuckoo etc are naturally found in this Bhawal forest This forest has many kinds of insects, apes, reptiles and its wetlands contain different types of endemic fishes. But at present most of these distinct flora and fauna species are in danger and struggling for existence.\nTo control ecological balance any country needs 25 percent forest. We have no sufficient forest in our country. We have only 9% (17% in official record). Furthermore, our forests are being destroyed day by day. We should take proper step to check deforestation. Government should impose some policies and law to protect forests. Already government has take some steps such as, extension and development of existing facilities for Bhawal National Park, creation of recreational facilities, improvement and extension of existing wildlife breeding centre, conservation and development of endangered wild animals, afforestation of degraded Sal forest and upon fallow land. Government can utilize the lower lands which are used by the local people, increase opportunities for eco-tourism, education and research. By increasing awareness of the local people near the Bhawal National Park we can protect this forest from deforestation, by training the employer who are engaged with the forest department.\nBiological resources and biological diversity form the basis of both the ecology and economy of Bangladesh. The agricultural activities, fisheries and livestock along with a number of other sections are heavily dependent directly or indirectly on biological resources.Bhawal forest is our biological resource. So we must protect this forest for our survival and development.Ashraful Alam is research coordinator, Society for Environment and Nature Study (SENS) Dept. of Environmental Science and Resource Management Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, Sontosh, Tangail.

      "text": "   A salesman sitting with an array of fake cosmetics at Gulistan.Photo: STAR Substandard and fake cosmetics products have flooded the city markets rendering millions of users vulnerable to different forms of skin and health diseases.\nMost of these cosmetics are of very low quality and produced using harmful chemicals.\nDermatologists say that use of substandard cosmetics may contain strong acids and alkalis that are harmful for skin and hair. These substances can cause itching, hair loss, swelling, pigmentation and even skin cancer.\n\"Some chemicals used in cosmetics products are harmful for health. Mostly substandard and cheap cosmetics products contain these chemicals that may cause severe skin diseases,\" said Dr Ibrahim Motin, a dermatologist.\n\"For instance, some skin brightening creams have chemicals that create an extra layer on the skin to prevent contacts with sunlight, which can have adverse effects in the longer run. It may even lead to skin cancer,\" he said.\nUnscrupulous local manufacturers produce counterfeit products of popular brands using poor quality materials while a huge amount of cheap cosmetics products are imported from India, China, Taiwan and other Asian countries.\n\"Our country does not have any specific standards or production guidelines for majority of cosmetics. Unscrupulous producers are taking advantage of this ambiguity and producing a wide range of products that violates international standards,\" said Emdad Hossain from Consumers' Association Bangladesh (CAB).\nOn a visit to the markets this correspondent found scores of substandard products including moisturisers, cleansers, soaps, powders, shampoo, conditioner, bleach, hair dyes, oils, and depilatories (hair removing agents) along with numerous other products.\n\"We have to keep items of both superior and lower qualities for the convenience of different classes of customers,\" said Mahfuz, a retailer from Moghbazar when asked why he is knowingly selling low-quality products.\n\"We do warn our customers that these may possibly be second-rate in quality but most buyers tend to prefer the cheap ones which are mostly substandard,\" added Mahfuz.\nWhile many of these 'look-alikes' are being sold without any seals or brands from the manufacturers, some are sold using names and logos similar to popular brands.\n\"With popular brands such as Nivea or Ponds, somebody can simply come up with a similar brand like Nirea or Pords and create look-alikes of products,\" said Mohammad Sattar, a wholesale dealer of groceries and cosmetics at Rampura.\n\"With similar names and logos, people tend to get confused and buy the substandard products. Cheap prices of these products also play a big role,\" he said.\nA number of counterfeit cosmetics factories have recently been unearthed in the city.\nThe law enforcement agencies seized over Tk 30 lakh worth of counterfeit cosmetics and chemicals used in the production of such products over the past few months, sources said.\n\"The usual trend in counterfeiting [cosmetics products] is to collect out-of-date products from wholesale markets and other sources. The materials are then put inside new packages and containers to be distributed through retailers,\" said a DMP official.\n\"Some of these manufacturers use their own brand name or logo for distribution while others simply use fake seals and logos imitating popular brands,\" he said.\n\"Cosmetics products have a huge market. It's quite a big cottage industry in our country. You can find small factories even at people's houses,\" said an official of Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI).\nAccording to sources, Rab seized fake cosmetics worth Tk 26 lakh along with huge amount of forged seals and packets of a major brand from a house turned factory in Rahmatganj in the old town in February this year.\nA good number of these products, although with 'BSTI' seals, are substandard.\n\"To avoid buying substandard items, people should be more watchful while buying a product. People should purchase products directly from the authorised dealers of the popular brands,\" said a CAB spokesperson.\nMany cosmetics are also being sold with 'ISO' seals on them, which is baseless and only misleads consumers, he said.\nAccording to Emdad Hossain, ISO (International Organization for Standardization) has nothing do to with the standards or quality of products. \"ISO practically sets a standard for the managerial functions of an organisation. Any organisation including banks and even schools or universities can obtain ISO certification,\" he said.\nBSTI officials blamed the scores of unauthorised manufactures illegally producing substandard cosmetics for the surge of substandard items flooding the market. They are unlawfully using the BSTI seals to delude unaware buyers.\nBSTI officials said they are conducting regular drives to get hold of the counterfeiters and take appropriate actions against them. \"We are conducting drives almost every day, and have had significant success,\" said a BSTI official.\n\"Taking actions against the actual manufactures is difficult as they do not leave any seals or imprints on their products, making it difficult for us to trace them. So we usually charge the retailers for selling substandard products,\" he said.\nAccording to BSTI officials, the penalty for counterfeiting cosmetics products ranges from a fine between Tk 7,000 and Tk 1 lakh to imprisonment. BSTI monitors the production and distribution of around 142 products as cosmetics."

The Natuarpara Degree College is also under threat, Water Development Board (WDB) sources said.\nDuring a visit to different affected areas including Natuarpara, Shubhogachha and Maizbari in Kazipur, The Daily Star found that many families in Shubhogachha and Maizbari are moving to safer places. The hapless were seen living under the open sky in the pouring rain.\nSurman Ali, 55, of Maizbari village said he had moved his home eight times in the last 10 years. This year, he has taken shelter on a road as his dwelling was devoured by the Jamuna a few days ago.\nRokeya Khatun, 42, a widow of Natuarpara village, said she lost her hut built on the only piece of land she owns to river erosion. She has now taken shelter on the Meghai embankment with her livestock.\nThe WDB office sources said the water level of the Jamuna is increasing unusually due to heavy rain and the rush of water from upstream, causing massive erosion along the western bank. They said the water level of the Jamuna is still bellow the danger mark.\nNizamul Huq Bhuiyan, executive engineer of WDB, told The Daily Star that they, with the help of army personnel, started dumping sandbags along the bank to protect areas in Kazipur and Shahzadpur upazilas.\nHe said he asked higher authorities to provide funding to implement projects to stop the erosion. He mentioned that they have built about 17 km of flood-control embankments on the western bank of the Jamuna which should save many areas from flooding this year.\nHowever, locals claim that the embankments are built with sand and will not help improve the situation since they usually wash away in heavy current."

      "headline": "To solve the transportation problem of Dhaka metropolitan area",
      "authors": "\nA S M Mahbubun Nabi\n",
      "text": "   In order to solve the transportation problem of Dhaka City, the Strategic Transport Plan (STP) for Dhaka City was initiated in March, 2004 by GOB with the assistance of World Bank, and with Louis Berger Inc. as Principal Consultants and Bangladesh Consultant Ltd. as local partner. In August, 2004 an Advisory Committee comprising of some 32 members from different categories of professionals, engineers, planners, architects, academics and civil servants was appointed to guide and oversee the work of the consultants. The plan (STP) was completed in December, 2005.\nThe Strategic Transport Plan (STP) has made some strategic recommendations to solve the transportation problems of Dhaka City. The major components of the Strategic Transport Plan are the following:\n(A) Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system, which include the following components :\na) Three Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Routes of total length of about 200km. at a total cost of U. S. $ 1.0 billion\nb) Three Metro Lines with an estimated cost of about U. S. $ 2.1 billion, or Taka 14,500 crore\n(B) 50 Roadway Projects including the following components\na) Three elevated expressways: Gulistan-Jatrabari Flyover; Gulistan - Mohakhali Elevated Expressway; and Moghbazar Flyover; and\nb) Two Bypass Roads: the Eastern Bypass and the Western Bypass.\nThe STP recommendations are highly capital-intensive option that will require a total investment of US$ 5.52 billion or Taka 38,000 crores for its implementation, but the benefits which will be achieved out of this investment will not be very significant. Some of the capital-intensive projects as recommended in the STP are discussed below :Metro System: The STP team has recommended a Metro System comprised of three Metro Lines at a total cost of U.S. $ 2.1 billion or Taka 14,500 crores. The total length of the Metro Lines is not known, but I guess it will be about 70 km. in length. If we consider that people will walk down to Metro Stations from a distance of 1 km. to avail the Metro service, then the area-coverage of Metro service will only be about 140 sq. km. But, the total area of Dhaka Metropolitan City (RAJUK area) is about 1530 sq. km. Hence, the area-coverage of Metro Service will be less than 10 percent of total area of Dhaka Metropolitan City.\nThe STP team has failed to recognize some major disadvantages of Metro system, such as, they are technically difficult and potentially unfeasible in a city prone to flooding. If the Metro system has to be safe for implementation and operation, then Dhaka City will have to be made completely flood-free for all time, which will be extremely difficult.\nMetro construction requires costly excavation. Typical costs of Metro is about $ 50.0 million to 240.0 million per km. Additional costs are involved with other infrastructures, such as underground Metro stations. A Metro station costs about $ 150.0 million.\nOperating costs of Metros are extremely high requiring very expensive electric rail cars. Metro systems require constant and huge supply of electricity which will be very difficult to be ensured in Dhaka City. Most Metro systems of the world have operating deficits which can often severe the budget of the country.\nWorldwide experience is that, except in a few cases the fare of the Metro ride is subsidized, and in some cases very heavily subsidized. The experience shows that the various Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) projects from the late 1990's are all in financial trouble and are nowhere achieving profitability.\nIn Sao Paulo Metro, the City Govt. pays a subsidy of $ 0.20 (25%) for each trip (total trips are 2.1 million per day). One of the more spectacular recent failures of a Metro and LRT was in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. In the system there was substantial subsidy in the fare. The result was a financial failure and the system was nationalized in late 2001. After only 3 years of operation the system accumulated debts of more than US$ 1.4 billion leading to the biggest bankruptcy in Malaysian corporate history. The 20km Metro in Singapore, built at a total cost of US$ 2.9 billion, have an operational loss of US$ 1.1 million per month in 2004.\nThe STP recommended Metro for Dhaka city, if it is built and operated, will have a minimum economic fare of Tk. 10.0 for the ride of 1 km. distance, which will be affordable only for a very small percentage of passengers. In order to make it affordable for middle-income group of people, at least 50 percent subsidy in the fare will be required. The STP has estimated that about 57,42,000 passenger trips will be carried daily by the Metro, and the average trip-lengths will be about 5 km. Hence, a subsidy of Tk. 143.55 million will have to be paid daily and the yearly subsidy will be about Tk. 5240 crores.\nThe construction of Metros is often agonizingly slow. The 20km Metro in Singapore was under construction for nearly 8 years. The Blue Line Subway (21km.) in Bangkok was under construction for about 7 years.\nFlexibility to expand and adaptability to a changing situation is also a key requirement for any mass transit system. Dhaka is rapidly growing and the situation in the city is rapidly changing. But the expansion of the Metro system is very complex.\nPer kilometer construction cost of Metro is about hundred times more than that of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, and thus the Metro system is likely to cover only a very small portion of the city and would be of far less use if the private auto users are not diverted to the Metro service.\nAccording to the STP estimate, the Dhaka Metropolitan Study Area will generate daily seven crore travel-trips of which only 8% of the trips will be served by Metro service. With an investment of Tk. 14,500 crores, the Metro system will not be able to solve more than 10 percent of the transportation problems of Dhaka City.Elevated Expressways and Flyovers: The STP team has recommended a system of Elevated Expressways and Flyovers of about 29 km. length. The construction cost of this system will be about U.S. $ 0.9 billion or Taka 6200 crores.\nElevated expressways generate their own traffic diverted from other roads. They favour only a very small minority of people driving cars and autos, often simply shift congestion from one point to another in the network, increases in noise, pollution, congestion and fuel consumption. As the former Mayor of Bogota, Enrique Penalosa once remarked, \"There are two ways to destroy a city. One is through nuclear bombing, and the other is with elevated roads\". The STP study itself exposed the potential disastrous consequences of elevated expressways. Government subsidies provided to the use of elevated expressways only favour the richest segment of the population which is contrary to equity goals. Evidence suggests that existing flyovers have actually caused an increase in traffic congestion on the roads below the flyovers.\nIn Dhaka city (in 2004) only one percent of the population was owners of autos and individualized transport (private car, jeep, micro, station wagon and pick-up). Flyovers and elevated expressways constructed at a great public expense, will only serve the needs of less than one percent people who own an individualized transport. For the remaining 99 percent of the people, these projects offer little benefit beyond increased difficulties and congestion, because the road capacities below the flyovers are reduced by at least 20 percent of the original capacity. Such facilities are of little benefit to buses, since buses generally move at ground level given the need for passenger to board and alight. These are inaccessible to pedestrians and cannot be used by rickshaws. They do not benefit the very large majority of people in the city and portrays a policy which cannot be sustainable.\nElevated expressways can only be justified in the cities where almost all families own a car. But in case of Dhaka, where auto-ownership is only one percent, it will be a great blunder to build elevated expressways. The capital once invested on such projects becomes fixed with the land and become unable to be withdrawn any significant part of the investment through failure to command a fair return from it.\nThe construction of elevated expressways through densely populated urban areas is likely to have serious detrimental impacts on environment and door-to-door accessibility. In Seoul, South Korea, government recently tore down an elevated expressway when they realized that it worsened the situation without solving any problem.The STP recommendations are biased and is detrimental to the economy of the country.\nThough the STP recommendations have been claimed to be a multimodal solution, but the study refers to only fuel-dependent transports ignoring the contributions of fuel-free non-motorized transports and pedestrians. Fuel-free non-motorized transport and pedestrian movements represent more than 50 percent of the total trips, and short trips constitute 76 percent of total trips in Dhaka City. How can the STP transport model be regarded as valid when it ignores the majority of the trips?\nThe STP study has other weaknesses as well. In order to assess mobility of passengers in a mixed mode urban area, it is imperative to evaluate transport alternatives with respect to door-to-door trips. The trip time or trip distance represents only a portion of the travel. The total travel constitutes link travel time, walking time, waiting time and penalties of modal transfer, which have not been considered in the STP model. Hence, the recommendations of the STP model do not ensure that this will increase the convenience of mobility and access for the majority of the people.\nThe Strategic Transport Plan (STP) for Dhaka city has opted for a transportation strategy which is highly capital intensive and which will require about US. $ 5.52 billion or Taka 38,000 crore for its implementation, but the strategy will not be successful in solving the transportation problem of Dhaka City. The reason is explained below:\nWhen the population of a city increases, the volume of traffic on the roads also increases, and as the volume of traffic on the roads increases, the transportation problem also increases,. The Strategic Transportation Plan for Dhaka City has been prepared for a population of 1,98,00,000 (within RAJUK area) in the year 2024. Beyond this period population of Dhaka City will grow at least at a growth rate of 3.0 percent per annum. Hence, the solution of transportation problem which has been given for a population of 1,98,00,000 will soon become ineffective at an increased level of population in the City.Then, what is the solution?The big cities of the world, which have become successful in solving the transportation problem, have, at first, adopted the strategies to restrain the growth of population in the cities. At present, the population of London is 10.5 million and the population is not increasing for the last 35 years; the population of New York is 15.8 million and the population is not increasing for the last 25 years ; the population of Tokyo is 12.0 million and the population is not increasing for the last 20 years; the population of Paris is 8.75 million and the population is not increasing for the last 30 years.\nIt is not automatic that the growth has been stopped in these cities, Rather it is through deliberate planning that the growth has been controlled. When the growth of the cities are controlled, then it become easier to solve the problems of the city.\nThere are various strategies to control the growth of cities. The strategy of \"Green-belt Plan and New Town Plan\" was adopted to restrain the growth of London; the strategy of \"satellite town plan\" was adopted to restrain the growth of Tokyo; the strategy of \"decentralized settlement\" was adopted for New York; the strategy of \"corridor plan\" was adopted to manage the growth of Washington, etc.\nAll these strategies are not fully applicable for Dhaka to restrain its growth. The main cause of rapid growth of Dhaka is that, all powers of the country is concentrated in Dhaka. Any type of decentralization policy for administration, economy or population will not be successful without the decentralization of power. For the decentralization of the power, the country is required to be divided into a number of provinces.\nAlmost all countries of the world have a three tier administrative system. The top tier is the national government, below that the second tier is the provincial government, and at the bottom is the local government. This type of administrative system has a great influence on the distribution of city sizes in the country and also on the balanced development of the county.\nThere is no county in the world except Bangladesh which has got one province with 14 crore population. The USA, with a population of 22.8 crore is divided into 50 provinces; on an average each province has got a population of 45 lakhs. Japan with a population of 12.6 crore is divided into 47 self-governing prefectures. The Assam region of India is divided into seven provinces, in which no province has population more than 1.5 crore; as a result, there is no city in Assam region which has population more than one million.\nFor effective decentralization of power, Bangladesh should have a three-tier administrative system and the country should be divided into a number of provinces. We propose nine provinces in Bangladesh according to the following table and the Map attached. Dhaka Metropolitan Area, including Greater Dhaka District with the total area of 7378 sq. km. and the total population of 1,71,92,103 (in the year 2001), should become Dhaka Metropolitan Province, just like, Delhi Metropolitan Area is a province of India, Tokyo Metropolitan Area is a self-governing prefecture in Japan; New York Metropolitan Area is a State in USA.\nThe Central Govt. located at Dhaka will be comprised of the ministries of Defense; Foreign Affairs; Finance and Planning; Home and Establishment; Foreign Trade and Strategic Industries; National Transportation and Communication; etc. (not more than 10 ministries).\nThe Provincial Govt. located at the provincial capital will be comprised of Ministries of Agriculture, Fisheries and Livestock; Health and Education; Local Govt., Urban and Rural Planning, Housing and Works; Food, Relief and Disaster Management; Religious Affairs and Social Welfare; Commerce and Industry; Land, Forest, Environment, Flood Control and Water Management; Roads and Highways; etc. (not more than 12 ministries)If the policy of decentralization of power is materialized through the creation of self-governing provinces, then what will happen to Dhaka City?\nMost of the ministries, government departments, organisations, corporations, and private offices will shrink in Dhaka. Two-thirds of the Secretariate Buildings will become vacant, BADC Bhaban at Motijheel and Matsya Bhaban at Kakrail will become completely vacant, WAPDA Bhaban at Motijheel will become 80 percent vacant, Education Directorate at Abdul Gani Road will become 70 percent vacant, PWD Bhaban at Segunbagicha will become 60 percent vacant, Housing Authority & Urban Development Building at Segunbagicha will become 90 percent vacant, Architecture office at Kakrail will become 70 percent vacant, Roads and Highway Department will become 70 percent vacant, LGED Bhaban at Agargaon will become 70% vacant. A large number of private offices and organisations will have to shift to provincial capital in order to run their businesses.\nAt least ten lakh people will decrease from Dhaka within three years of formation of Provincial Government. and another ten lakh people will continue to decrease during the next ten years.\nGrowth of population in Dhaka City will be effectively controlled. Solution to transportation and the water supply and sanitation problems will become easier and less costly. Many other problems of Dhaka will be much easier and cheaper to be solved.\nThe capital investment of Tk. 38,000 crores will no longer be required for the solution of transportation problem of Dhaka city. This amount can be evenly distributed to the provincial capitals for their development. A balanced development of the county will be ensured.\nDemand for housing in Dhaka will decrease. House rent will decrease, Land value will decrease. Real Estate developers' business at Dhaka will decline, but will flourish at the provincial capitals.\nNow, I tell you a story. A few days back I met a school teacher from Rangpur. I asked him, \"Why have you come to Dhaka?\" He replied, \"I am going to retire very soon. I have come to Dhaka to enquire how much I shall get from benevolent fund after my retirement\". He also told. \"I have traveled by night coach and reached Gabtali bus terminal in the morning, from Gabtali I went to my daughter's house in the cantonment, from there I went to the Education Directorate office at Abdul Gani Road, from there I went to BANBEIS office at Nilkhet, from BANBEIS office I came to you, from here I shall go to see my son at Malibagh, from Malibagh I shall return to my daughter's house at the cantonment, and next morning I shall return to Rangpur.\" I found the gentleman extremely tired, exhausted and pale.\nMore than sixty thousand people come to Dhaka daily for such purposes and another sixty thousand people go out of Dhaka daily after performing their jobs. Since these people have to perform their jobs within a day or two, they undertake about 5-6 trips daily. In Dhaka, about three lakhs of vehicular trips are generated daily by these types of people. Again, more than 1000 numbers of bus trips are required daily to bring sixty thousand people to Dhaka, and another 1000 bus trips are required daily to take then out of Dhaka.\nNow, the question is, can we not reduce the number of commuters to Dhaka and the generation of such a huge number of vehicular trips in Dhaka.\nSurely the number of commuters to Dhaka and the generation of huge number of trips by them will be drastically reduced when the governmental power will be decentralized to the Provincial Capitals. Provincial citizens will not need to come to Dhaka, rather they will go to the Provincial Capitals to perform their purpose. Daily bus trips to and from Dhaka will be reduced by at least 50 percent. The pressure on all inter-city bus terminals will substantially be reduced.The author is Professor, Dept. of Urban & Regional Planning, BUET, Dhaka."

Most of such projects are completed and hardly known to the public today.\nThe plans on display specify exact area of a project. People are invited to see the display and check out authenticity of a private housing project.\nRajuk used to deal with approval of private housing projects before enactment of Wetland Conservation Act of 2000, Environment Conservation Act of 1995, Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan (DMD) of 1995 and private housing rules of 2004.\nIn case the developers initiate extension or alteration of the layout plan of any project, they have to obtain approval under the private housing rules of 2004.\nThe rules clearly prohibit sale, allotment and advertisements of unauthorised housing projects in any manner before obtaining approval from the authorities. It is a punishable offence under the Building Construction Act of 1952 (amended in 2006).\nViolation of the housing development rules destroying natural environment is also punishable under the Environment Conservation Act of 1995.\nBut powerful housing developers often make publicity of their unauthorised projects on television and in newspapers and public places to sell plots and flats.\nHowever, these developers are silent now in the wake of the interim government's anti-corruption drives and action against illegal activities, said Rajuk sources.\nMost of these housing companies are not even registered with Rajuk, they added.\nA crucial precondition for implementing a housing project is that the layout plan of a proposed project must have a GPS-based (Global Positioning System) topographical survey map clearly marking cultivable and non-cultivable lands, wetlands, flood retention ponds and basins, canal, river, creek and forestation.\nRecently, the national committee on approving the private housing (land) projects rejected applications of two private developers on the ground that they could not meet the prerequisites for approval as per the private housing project land development rules.\nThe rules of 2004 provide that any extension or continuation of a completed project, let alone the new ones, has to obtain approval.\nAccording to records at Rajuk, Pallabi Abashik (30.44 acres) and Arambagh Cooperative Housing (7.59 acres) projects of Eastern Housing Ltd got approval in 1984. Kalyanpur Land Project (4.79 acres) of the same developer got approval in 1986. Cap Hasan (Niketan) Housing Project (68.53 acres) of Eastern Housing got approval in 1987.\nAdarsha Chhayanir Greeha Nirman Samabay Samity project (4.5 acres) got approval in 1986. Baitul Aman Cooperative Housing Project (12 acres) got approval in 1986, Mohammadpur Pisciculture Housing Project (38.01 acres) in 1987, Firoza Properties and Development residential project (9.10 acres in Mohammadpur) in 1987 and Metropolitan Christian Co-operative Housing Project in Tejgaon got approval in 1987.\nJanata Housing Project (4.40 acres in Kafrul and Mirpur) got approval 1987. Postagola (2.22 acres), Rayerbazar (10.03 acres), KM Das Lane (4.02 acres), Bashabo (3.03 acres) and Shishmahal (11.31 acres) projects of Eastern Housing got approval in 1987. Cap Hasan Housing Project in Paikpara (6.13 acres) got approval in the same year.\nPostagola Riverview Land Project (29 bighas) of Eastern Housing got approval in 1989, Mallika residential project (4.53 acres in Mirpur) of Sheltech Private Limited in 1990, Blue Star Estate (0.33 decimals in Kakrail) of Blue Star Real Estate Limited got permission in 1990, Probal Housing (8.49 acres in Mohammadpur) in 1990 and Janata Co-operative Housing (14 acres in Mohammadpur) in 1990.\nMukti Real Estate in Mirpur got approval in 1990, Sukhinir residential project (3.99 acres) in 1992, Susomoy Bahumukhi project in Uttarkhan and Gobindapur in 1994 and Jahangirnagar University Cooperatives' Aurunapalli project (82.34 acres in Savar) got approval in 1998.\nBasundhara (Baridhara extension) housing project of East West Property Development Limited got approval for 305 acres. But the developer later placed a proposal of 1247.30-acre extended project."

      "text": "   The earth is crying out for water. Photo: Iqbal Ahmed/ Drik News THE problem of water shortage, compounded by pollution, is causing indisputable harm in most poor countries of Asia and Africa. The population in poor countries like Bangladesh is growing so fast that improvements on water supply have failed to keep pace. Worldwide, two billion people still have no access to clean water, and water contaminated by sewage is estimated to kill 3.4 million, including two million children, every year.\nWater experts have sounded an alarm that within the next 25 years, half of the world's population could have trouble in finding enough fresh water for drinking and irrigation. Currently, as reports reveal, at least 80 countries, representing 40 percent of the world's population, are subject to severe water shortages. Conditions may get worse as population grows and global warming disrupts rainfall patterns.\nPeople in West Asian countries now use 54 per cent of the available fresh water, and additional demand will further jeopardise the ecosystem. Added to this is the problem of pollution caused by fertilisers, pesticides, silts, sewage and other toxic effluents that have killed lakes and poisoned rivers.\nThe crisis did not end there. Half of the world's wetlands have been drowned through conversion, diversion and fragmentation of the system, resulting in destruction of habitat. Polluted water, which provides a breeding ground for parasites, amoebas, and bacteria, damages the health of 1.2 billion people a year. Water borne diseases are responsible for 80 percent of illnesses and deaths in the developing world, killing a child every eight seconds.\nThe water crisis, it is now believed, has been caused by the dam building mentality of the developed nations. The Hoover Dam, built over the Colorado river to support Los Angeles, inaugurated an age of dam building. The dam building mentality, however, has pretty much expired in the developed world, but is still prevalent throughout much of the rest of the world. In China, which is erecting the Three Gorges Dam, the biggest hydroelectric project in history and at $25 billion the most expensive, one sees outright resentment against rivers running free.\nAlmost everyone appreciates how water projects have altered the course of civilisation in ways we call (perhaps foolishly) benign. Dams and reservoirs permit unimaginable numbers of people to inhabit forbiddingly arid regions as well as flood plains, where cities would be washed away without upstream protection.\nDespite the fact that dams provide more clean energy than any other conventional source, including nuclear reactors, and reservoirs behind the dam supply irrigation water to farmlands, they have well-publicised vices. They are notorious for causing great environmental change and force massive human resettlement, mostly of people who live where the lake is due to appear.\nDams, with all their material blessings, are responsible for some of the worst environmental tragedies in history. The Three Gorges Dam is now under construction upriver in Sinchuan province, but turning the upper Yangtze into the world's greatest reservoirs won't stop flooding, inundation and pollution of water areas and vast farmlands in the lower riparian countries, India and ultimately Bangladesh.\nThe construction of the Farakka Barrage in West Bengal in India did not yield the anticipated benefit even for India, let alone the unimaginable havoc it has wrought on Bangladesh through the drying up of rivers, creating a severe water shortage. West Bengal bears the brunt of the folly and fancy of the central government. The huge amount of silt deposited in the upstream has reduced the depth and slope of the Ganges, causing in its wake erosion and change of course of the river.\nThe Ganges carries 80 crore ton of silt every year. In just three decades after the commissioning of the Farakka Barrage, because of the obstruction caused, the Ganges is now laden with a huge amount of silt, reducing the depth of the river. We are yet to see what effect the Tipaimukh dam, to be constructed in Manipur state in India, has on both India and Bangladesh.\nReports circulated by UNDP, FAO, WHO and World Bank indicate that the world's supply of clean fresh water, already threatened by construction of dams and growing levels of pollution, is going to be so scarce in some areas that, if the current trend continues, two-thirds of humanity will suffer moderate to severe water stress within 30 years.\nThe report warns that the situation imperils not only human health and development on a large scale, but also the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems on which much of Earth's life depends. There is clear and convincing evidence, the report says, that the world faces a worsening series of local and regional water quantity and quality problems, largely as a result of poor water allocation, wasteful use of water resource and lack of management resources.\n\"The glaring lack of attention to water issues seems puzzling, and may be termed as the most critical failure of the 20th century and a major challenge for the 21st,\" contends Peter Gleick, one of the world's leading experts on fresh water resources. Gleick further says that the economic costs are not that high compared to the costs of failing to meet those needs. There is hardly any second opinion about the fact that we are now facing a world water gap and, because of our apathy, it is getting worse with each passing day.\nWith about 250 rivers that once dotted the country, Bangladesh is now identified as a water-scarce country. The consequences of failing to bridge the gap will be higher food prices and expensive food imports. Hunger and thirst, experts say, are linked to political instability and low rates of economic growth.\nThat underscores the fact that there must be political will and national consensus in solving the key issues affecting people's lives. With the food and disaster management ministry receiving the highest allocation in the current budget, it would be wise for the government to invest a sizable amount for creating water reservoirs, excavating silted tanks and canals, and maintaining flow of rivers by proper dredging, as the prime minister has asserted on different occasions in the past six months.\nThese measures will work as steps towards disaster preparedness, augment food production and meet the crisis of drinking water. With underground water table being depleted abnormally because of excessive extraction, we have to conserve surface water to allow aquifers to be charged.\nMoreover, as much of the world becomes urbanised, its water crisis will deepen. Dhaka, a mega city of 12.5 million people, has to rely mostly (about 87 percent) on ground water, but aquifers take decades to recharge while the population growth in the city is exponential. Human activity is playing an ever greater role in creating water scarcity and \"water stress\" -- defined as the indication that there is not enough good quality water to meet human needs.\nBurning fossil fuels indiscriminately to power industrial growth, deforestation and dam-building are some of the ill-thought out activities the developed countries have been carrying on to meet their insatiable needs. In consequence, global warming fueled by excessive carbon emission has resulted in a drought like situation, creating water scarcity in many parts of the world including Bangladesh.\nThe fact is that, population wise and area wise, in respect of water resources Bangladesh is not in a very uncomfortable position. But its people are having an increasingly difficult time managing, allocating and protecting the water that exists. And the present government, that has made firm pledges to usher in changes, must meet the challenge squarely.Md.

      "text": "   Dhaka: Earthquake prone, but totally unprepared. Photo: Munir Uz Zaman/ Drik News THE two earthquakes of moderate magnitude that rattled a vast area of Bangladesh within a span of 24 hours in the past week have once again brought forth the earthquake concern as well as awakened the nation to the need of preparedness for facing the spectre.\nOne of the most powerful earthquakes that hit southern Asia on December 26, 2004, unleashing a tsunami, also shook Bangladesh with water rising by several feet at different places. The earthquake, measuring 7.36 on the Richter scale, shook buildings and other structures and caused cracks in a number of structures in the port city.\nIn the recent past, four notable earthquakes occurred in Bangladesh. A quake of magnitude 5.6 occurred on May 8, 1997, in Sylhet, damaging some buildings. On November 21 in the same year a quake of 5.9 magnitude hit Chittagong and brought down a five-storied under-construction building, claiming 23 lives.\nNorth Bengal and Dhaka city were rocked by a moderate earthquake in December 2001, and some buildings in Dhaka city developed cracks. A magnitude 6 quake hit Chittagong and Khagrachhari on November 7, 2007 and caused many cracks in the hills.\nBangladesh is an earthquake prone country as it lies along the border of the Eurasian and Indo-Australian plates, where earthquakes of comparatively uniform intensity are generated at regular intervals. In this region, earthquakes may occur in a cyclic order of hundred years and, according to the experts, the Great Indian Earthquake of 1897 is likely to be repeated every hundred years.\nThe meteorological department detected at least 90 earthquakes that occurred in the country between May 2007 and July 2008, nine of which measured above 5 on the Richter scale, and the epicenters of 95% of the quakes were within a 600 km radius of Dhaka city. Buet observatory recorded 86 quakes between January 2006 and May 2009, of which four were above magnitude 5.\nThe threat of earthquake is a matter of great concern to Bangladesh, and repeated tremors in different areas may be warnings for a severe one, as per opinion of the experts in this field. But the worrying aspect is that the people's preparedness and awareness to face a fatal earthquake seem to be almost zero. What has so far been done is preparation of a map dividing the country into three seismic zones.\nNatural calamities like cyclone, flood, tornado, tidal bore, drought and downpour are more or less known to the people of our country. But an earthquake is quite different from other natural calamities because any kind of forecasting or prediction is impossible.\nSo it is urgently necessary to prepare the people of our country adequately to face a catastrophe like an earthquake. The government has taken up a five-year project, titled \"Comprehensive Disaster Management Project,\" to reduce the risks of natural calamities, with special focus on creating awareness about earthquakes. But nothing noteworthy has happened so far.\nDhaka is the riskiest city amongst the top 20 cities of the world according to the Earthquake Disaster Risk Index (EDRI). A catastrophic earthquake may cause heavy casualties and destruction of properties in our densely populated capital city because of lack of awareness and necessary preparations.\nThe meteorological department established a seismic observatory at Chittagong in 1954, which is now obsolete and not adequate for a country located in the seismic zone.\nThe High Court, in a commendable move, recently issued a rule on the government to procure necessary equipment for conducting rescue operations in case a stronger quake hits any part of the country in future.\nThe government should take immediate steps for setting up a seismological observatory network equipped with modern and sensitive earthquake monitoring facilities for continuous monitoring and prediction.\nThe most important part of the task is to enhance the level of awareness among the people to face earthquakes. The print and electronic media can play a vital role in preparing the people to face such a calamity.\nAs far as the post-quake rescue operation is concerned, the government should organise rescue operation campaigns and civil defense exercises all over the country under its Comprehensive Disaster Management Project. which is financed by the donor agencies."

      "text": "   The authorities of Uttara University put up signboards on the floodplain of Turag river with a plan to set up their campus on the vast wetland.Photo: Syed Zakir Hossain In a city of concrete jungle, developers with the idea of \"river view\" and \"lake view\" housing projects are making good business though most of them don't have government approval.\nNow a 'river view' private university is going to join them as Uttara University has erected a signboard on the floodplain of the Turag. The signboard stands in knee- or waist-deep water seven months a year.\nAmid encroachment by housing estates, private universities and refuelling stations, the tiny Turag, the major flood flow system of the capital from north to south, is being choked and reduced every day.\nThe river is mentioned on the papers of Water Development Board to be 218 metres in width at Mirpur point. However, years of grabbing has reduced it to less than 18 metres in width in many places.\nLocals say some government officials have bought a vast swath by the river and filled it up for a housing project called Pratyasha Housing. Different other housing companies are now filling up the river elsewhere.\nUttara University has projected to buy around 20 bighas of land in Kamarpara village just beside the Tongi-Ashulia Highway and already registered 11 bighas.\nThis area is identified as the sub-flood flow zone in the Dhaka master plan, most of which has already been filled up as the government authorities keep a blind eye.\nThere is a specific law in effect -- the Open Space and Natural Water Body Conservation Act, 2000 -- which prohibits change of characteristics of any wetland.\nContacted, Dr Azizur Rahma, vice-chancellor of Uttara University, said: \"Nobody is obeying the law; why are you asking me only? We are not different from others.\n\"Besides, the government has no right to prohibit me from developing my land,\" he added. \"We have checked the land documents several times and are sure all our land is legal.\"\nHe added they wanted to be very 'clean' as they are going to set up a university in that wetland.\n\"We haven't taken any government land or encroached on any river,\" he claimed.\nAccording to the law, it is prohibited to change any natural land in the capital and all municipalities for conservation of all playgrounds, open space, parks and natural reservoirs.\nIf anyone violates the law, they should suffer five years in prison and may also be fined up to Tk 50,000.\nUnfortunately, the law is hardly enforced, apparently encouraging the encroachers to repeat their offence again and again."

Scores of people were reported missing.Photo: Zobaer Hossain Sikder Cyclone Aila hit the country's south-western coast yesterday afternoon, killing at least 18 people and washing away several thousand homes, as wind-driven tidal surge inundated vast tracts of land.\nFour people in Bhola, three each in Khulna, Patuakhali, Noakhali, Laxmipur, one in Barguna and a child in Barisal died, while a few hundred thousand people were marooned in the affected areas.\nOver 500 people were reported missing, mostly fishermen who were yet to return from the sea.\nIn the Indian state of West Bengal, at least 19 people died as Aila lashed Kolkata and five adjoining districts. The cyclone affected around one lakh people in West Bengal and paralysed normal life, reports our correspondent Pallab Bhattacharya from India.\nPacking winds of up to 90km an hour, the storm roared into Khulna, Satkhira, Patuakhali, Bagerhat, Barisal, Barguna, Pirojpur, Jhalakathi, Laxmipur, Jessore and Bhola around 2:00pm yesterday.\nThousands of people were made homeless as tidal waves leaping up to 13 feet high rolled onto those coastal districts. The waves damaged river and flood-control embankments and dykes, submerging many villages in Khulna, Satkhira, Patuakhali and Barisal.\nA large number of domestic animals and standing crops on farmland were lost in the surge.\nFood and Disaster Management Minister Abdur Razzak officially confirmed five deaths in Bhola and Patuakhali.\nSpeaking at a hurriedly called press briefing at his ministry, he however could not give more details on casualties and losses as Bangladesh Navy and Coastguard ships could not go to the offshore islands from Chittagong due to the turbulent sea, reports UNB.\nHeavy rain raised water level of rivers submerging thousands of thatched houses and shanties while strong wind uprooted trees and toppled houses. Many unions went under knee- to waist-deep water.\nRiver communications between the capital and all southern districts remained cut off since yesterday morning. Power supply to those districts also snapped in the evening.\nFerry service between Paturia and Daulatdia was suspended around 3:00pm, while that in Mawa has already been put on hold since Sunday evening.\nLocal administration of districts and upazilas in the coastal belt had started evacuating people to safer places and many took shelter at cyclone shelters, schools and colleges before Aila made landfall.\nThe Met office has asked Mongla Port to hoist Danger Signal-7.\nBhola, Barisal, Patuakhali, Barguna, Pirojpur, Jhalakathi, Bagerhat, Khulna, Satkhira, Jessore and their offshore islands and chars will be under this signal, read a special Met office bulletin issued in the evening.\nIt, however, advised Chittagong and Cox's Bazar ports to hoist Danger Signal-6.\nIn Dhaka and elsewhere in the country, there were strong wind and heavy rainfall since yesterday morning.\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday instructed her ministers to take necessary steps, from their respective positions, for helping the Aila affected.\nAt a cabinet meeting yesterday afternoon, she ordered members of the armed forces to join in the relief and rescue operations.\nOur correspondent in Satkhira reports: Around one lakh people of 95 villages of Shyamnagar and Ashashuni upazilas became marooned as flood-protection embankments gave away in at least 25 places.\nOver 100 people were reported missing in the district.\nFlood-protection dykes on the Kabodak, Khalpetua, Madar, Chulkuri and Kalia breached and swamped a number of villages. Many villages near the Sundarbans went under water as well.\nA large number of people have taken shelter at different cyclone centres, schools and madrasas.\nSome rivers of the district were flowing eight to 13 feet higher than their usual levels.\nDeputy Commissioner (DC) Abdus Samad said a 33-member team of Bangladesh Navy has left for the cyclone-hit areas to conduct rescue operations. The team was facing difficulties due to the adverse weather.\nRed Crescent has also gone in with water purifying tablets and other relief materials. The DC has allocated 10 tonnes of rice and Tk 1 lakh for immediate relief.\nOur correspondent in Barisal reports: Aila snapped road and river communications in the district since Sunday night. Rivers, their estuaries and confluences became very rough.\nHigh tides in rivers inundated many areas of the district causing considerable damage to properties. Strong wind also brought down houses and trees. The storm destroyed livestock and crops as well.\nRabbi, 7, of Char Laxmi Bardhan, drowned, said UNO of Bakerganj upazila.\nIn Bhola, the dead were identified as Harun, 27, and Giasuddin, 30, of Bhola Sadar, Nazim, 18, of Charfashion, Rozina, 4, of Manpura.\nCrops on 25,000 acres of land were damaged, the UNO claimed.\nOur staff correspondent in Khulna reports: Aila struck Khulna city and Bagerhat around 2:30pm with wind speed of up to 90kmph.\nThree people died in Batiaghata and Koira upazilas while over one lakh people got marooned in the districts. Of the three dead, one was identified as Kuntal Biswas, 65, of Jileghata village of Batiaghata upazila.\nOver one lakh people of Dacope and Koira upazilas in Khulna and Mongla, Sharankhola and Morrelganj upazilas of Bagerhat were moved to cyclone shelters or safe places.\nFive ships were moved to the safety of the outer anchorage of Mongla Port.\nUpazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Kazi Atiur Rahman of Dacope said six out of nine unions went under waist-deep water. Over 50,000 people were rendered homeless in the upazila.\nDisaster control rooms have been opened up in upazilas of Khulna and Bagerhat where volunteers, officials of some non-government organisations and officials of Relief and Rehabilitation Department have been kept on standby to deal with the aftermath, said the deputy commissioners of the two districts.\nOur correspondent in Patuakhali reports: Huge areas of Patuakhali and Barguna went under eight to 10 feet of seawater.\nThree people died in the storm in Patuakhali alone and another one in Barguna.\nOf the dead in Patuakhali, Afzal Mollik, 60, of Bawfal upazila and two-year-old Sumaiya were identified.\nSeveral kilometres of flood-control embankments in Golachipa, Kalapara and Patuakhali Sadar was washed away by the tidal surge.\nKuakata remained cut off from the rest of the country as three ferry terminals on Kalapara-Kuakata Highway got submerged.\nIn Nijhum Dwip in Hatia of Noakhali, Nazma Begum, 10, drowned and in Keringchar two other children died when a wall collapsed on them, reported private TV channel Desh TV.\nThe channel claimed that three, including two children, died in Chargajaria of Laxmipur.\nOur Cox's Bazar correspondent reports: Twenty-one fishing trawlers went missing with 400 fishermen onboard.\nAround 25-km-long embankment in Moheshkhali was damaged and about 800 shrimp enclosures were washed away in the tidal surge.\nActing Mayor of Cox's Bazar Municipality Sarwar Kamal said around 2,000 houses were flooded by the tidal waves.\nMeanwhile, the ongoing HSC and equivalent examinations in Aila affected areas have been postponed.\nA government handout last night said the HSC examinations scheduled for Tuesday in cyclone-affected areas would be held later on.\nIt said deputy commissioners of affected districts in consultation with the respective education boards would decide where examinations would not be held.\nIn Kolkata, incessant rain accompanied by strong wind, with speed reaching 100-120kmph, hit the metropolis and all flights at the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport were suspended from 2:00pm, official sources said.\nChief Minister of West Bengal Buddhadeb Bhattacharya said he alerted the Indian army while the Border Security Force and police have begun rescue operations in the Sundarbans and South 24 Parganas district where hundreds of mud-built houses collapsed.\nThe army was moving into Sandeshkhali and Hingalganj in North 24 Parganas and at Sagar Dwip, Gosaba and Patharpratima in South 24 Parganas."

Five navy ships have been working to bring people stranded in offshore islands to safety.\nFood Minister Abdur Razzak yesterday visited different cyclone-hit areas in Bhola, Patuakhali, and Khulna. He distributed relief among the locals at Panpatti village under Galachipa upazila in Patuakhali district.\nLater, briefing reporters in the capital, he said water crisis seems to be the main problem in the coastal areas. Some 278 water purification machines of the army are in operation to deal with the shortage of safe drinking water.\nRazzak said the cyclone has affected at least 30 lakh people.\nDeputy commissioners, upazila nirbahi officers, upazila chairmen and vice-chairmen are carrying out relief work in 14 districts.\nThe administration will distribute rice among the victims through VGF cards. It has an adequate stock of rice at every upazila. Already 2,500 tonnes of rice and Tk 1.23 crore in cash have been sent to the local administration for distribution, he added.\nThe government will not seek aids from the international community as long as it can tackle the situation on its own. \"We will however consider if anyone offers any relief or assistance.\"\nLocal officials said several lakh people were still stuck in remote chars. Many took refuge on treetops and roofs of their submerged houses.\nThe Red Crescent Society in its report yesterday said over 33 lakh people in eight districts were affected by the cyclone. Around 1 lakh were taken to safe shelters under an evacuation campaign by volunteers and law enforcement agencies, BSS adds.\nOur Barisal correspondent reports: In Barisal division, Bhola appears to have borne the worst of the cyclone.\nRoad and water communications between seven upazilas in the district have been snapped for two days now.\nLocal sources said Aila has destroyed thousands of hectares of crops including Aus, Aman and Boro rice, and vegetables.\nManpura flood control embankment has been breached at many points. Strong current has carried away a 10-km stretch of the dam, and onrushing tide levelled hundreds of homes.\nPeople in the remote flood-affected areas were suffering from an acute shortage of drinking water.\nOur staff correspondent from Khulna reports: At 5:00pm yesterday, the death count in the cyclonic storm stood at 22, according to official sources.\nOf the dead, 20 were in Khulna district and the other two, women, in Bagerhat district.\nThe storm and tidal surge have destroyed almost 80 percent of the forest camps in Chandpai and Sharankhola ranges, said Mihir Kumar, divisional forest officer in charge of the Sundarbans east wing.\nAccording to Khulna district control room, Aila has left around 30,000 houses in ruins. The number could be even higher once a full assessment is done.\nUnofficial sources said over three lakh people in Khulna and Bagerhat districts have remained marooned as of filing this report at 7:00pm.\nAt least 90 percent of shrimp enclosures and flood control dams in Khulna and Bagerhat districts have been washed away.\nCargo handling at Mongla Port, which was suspended on Sunday night, resumed yesterday morning.\nOur correspondent from Satkhira said at least 32 people including children were killed in Cyclone Aila. Shyamnagar and Assassuni upazilas were the worst affected.\nAt least 90 percent of thatched houses and mud huts have been demolished by Aila-fed tidal surge, forcing thousands of people to take shelter in nearby buildings and cyclone centres.\nThose in cyclone shelters were passing hard times for scarcity of food, drinking water and medicines. The local administration was yet to launch any relief efforts.\nMeanwhile, fears of an outbreak of diarrhoea and other water-borne diseases were growing.\nOur Patuakhali correspondent reports: The number of people affected in Cyclone Aila is over 11.50 lakh. Around 400 km flood control embankment and 75 km roads of LGED have been damaged.\nThe district had at least 30,000 hectares of crops including Aus damaged in the storm.\nOur Gopalganj correspondent said hundreds of mud houses were knocked down and trees uprooted during the cyclone on Monday.\nThe affected areas had been without electricity for over 24 hours. Land phone connections and mobile network were yet to start functioning.\nAccording to government figures, 352 unions and 62 upazilas in 14 districts--Barisal, Bhola, Pirojpur, Patuakhali, Barguna, Jhalakathi, Khulna, Bagerhat, Satkhira, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Laxmipur, Feni and Noakhali--have been affected.\nCrops on 68,385 acres of land have been damaged completely and those on 2,39,212 acres partially. A total of 42,038 houses have been flattened and 1,98,823 damaged. Of the roads in the 14 districts, 258.5 km have been too battered to be used.\nBesides, 509 km embankments have been wrecked and 2,155 km damaged.EXAMS POSTPONEDThe HSC and equivalent examinations scheduled for the next two days have been postponed in nine upazilas--Ashashuni and Shamnagar of Satkhira, Koira, Paikgacha, Botiaghata, Dumuria and Dakop of Khulna, and Mongla and Rampal of Bagerhat district.\nJessore Board Controller Amirul Islam told The Daily Star that dates for these examinations would be announced later."

Google Image The lands, on which Bashundhara Group Chief Ahmed Akbar Sobhan alias Shah Alam promised two football stadiums for Bangladesh Football Federation, are mostly part of protected wetlands and flood flow zones, which cannot be legally used for building anything on them, according to Rajuk sources.\nShah Alam promised the lands for the two stadiums from his Bashundhara Baridhara Project area near the Balu River, and from the Riverview Project near the Buriganga River, both under Bashundhara Group's real estate development company, East West Property Development (Pvt) Ltd, and both of which are mostly in protected flood flow zones and wetlands.\nRiverview is unauthorised and it cannot get the authorisation without amending the laws related to protected wetlands and Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan (DMDP), while Bashundhara-Baridhara Project has only partial authorisation.\nAccording to DMDP, most of the areas of both projects are designated as flood flow zones and wetlands, and the government cannot approve housing projects on any of those lands under the Wetland Conservation Act 2000, and the Rules for Land Development for Private Housing Project 2004, said Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) officials and experts.\n\"Except 305 acres of area under Bashundhara-Baridhara Project, neither Basundhara Baridhara Extension nor Riverview is approved under the Rules for Land Development for Private Housing Project 2004,\" said a Rajuk official.\nActually, Bashundhara Group intends to build the football stadiums either on government lands, or by filling up canals or sections of the rivers or the flood flow zones within the project areas, to make it a credential for later, for backing up the company's demand for legitimising its illegal projects, the sources said.\nAhmed Akbar Sobhan, chairman of Basundhara Group, on April 12 during a ceremony for a Tk 4.5 crore deal signing with Bangladesh Football Federation in Kurmitola Golf Club of the capital, promised to give the football federation 10 bighas of land in each of his Bashundhara-Baridhara Project and Riverview Project.\nFor a decade, illegal housing projects have been destroying protected wetlands and flood flow zones clearly earmarked in DMDP, said experts.\nFilling of wetlands and flood flow zones with earth by real estate developers is not only ushering in an imminent environmental disaster, but also is consistently choking the capital with perennial waterlogging and a mess in sewer management, the experts added.\nProf Muzaffer Ahmad, chairman of Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB), said certain special interest quarters might have worked as liaison between the immediate past National Sports Council (NSC) chairman, who is also the army chief, and the Bashundhara Group chairman, who is a convicted individual.\nRiverview Project has lands that were developed by filling sections of the Buriganga River, protected wetlands, and sub-flood-flow zone, said the experts.\n\"It is just an attempt to get away with illegality, corruption, and unethical activities, by offering sponsorship for promotion of the country's sports,\" Prof Muzaffer said.\nEast West Property has not even submitted any plan to Rajuk yet for its Riverview Project while Bashundhara-Baridhara Extension from F block to L block got only conditional approval on September 25, 2006.\nThe immediate past works minister Mirza Abbas, at the very end of BNP-led four-party coalition government's tenure, gave a conditional approval to Bashundhara-Baridhara Extension. But it became null and void, as East West Property could not even submit by the stipulated date of September 30, 2008 the layout in compliance with the preconditions set by the National Approval Committee on Private Housing Project during the immediate past caretaker government.\nThe approval for block A to F (only partially for blocks D and F) of Bashundhara-Baridhara Project was given before the formulation of the land development rules 2004, said Rajuk officials.\nThey also said cases under the wetland conservation act and private land development rules are pending against Riverview Project.\nA case in connection with Riverview Project was filed in Keraniganj under the wetland protection act on July 23, 2003, and another case in connection with the same project was filed on February 8, 2007 under the land development rules 2004, said an official of Rajuk, the agency that filed both the cases.\nGovernment officials led by Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Aminul Islam of Keraniganj launched a drive on May 20, 2008 to reclaim public land occupied by Bashundhara Group in Hasnabad area for Riverview Housing Project.\nThe drive followed the filing of a case against the chairman of Bashundhara Group by Assistant Land Officer Md Zunaid Hossain of Keraniganj union last April, on charge of grabbing 61 acres of government land.\nThe company had earmarked government land as land of the project area and put up signboards.\nThe upazila assistant commissioner (land) of Keraniganj back then reportedly said Bashundhara Group illegally occupied 61 acres of government land in Hasnabad for its housing project and sold out most of it.\nDeputy Managing Director of East West Property Development Tawhidul Islam however said the conditional approval for Bashundhara-Baridhara Extension has not been cancelled. \"We have submitted the layout plan for Bashundhara-Baridhara Extension in compliance with all preconditions. But we have yet to get the approval.\"\nRegarding Riverview Project, he said they have 'partially' submitted the layout plan.\n\"We will decide in time where the stadiums will be developed,\" he said.\nPresident of Bangladesh Football Federation Kazi Salahuddin said since Bashundhara Group offered the lands as gifts, he did not check whether those are legal or illegal.\n\"I could not manage the time to meet the Bashundhara authorities to seek answers to all the questions, and to check the legal status and locations of the lands,\" he added."

Worldwide, two billion people still have no access to clean water, and water contaminated by sewage is estimated to kill 3.4 million, including two million children, every year.\nNow it is a great irony that our planet, which has 70 percent of its surface covered with water, is facing an acute water crisis. It is alleged that the next world conflict could be for water. 97.5 percent of the water on the earth is ocean water, which is salty. 1.725 percent is in the form of glaciers, snow and permafrost, 0.075 percent is ground water, and 0.025 percent is in the lakes, swamps and rivers.\nThough it is claimed that 16 percent of the world's safe water is in Bangladesh, we are also suffering from serious crisis of pure drinking water. In summer, most of the major cities suffer from water crisis. Rivers around major cities have become polluted, and the water is unsuitable for drinking even after treatment in traditional plants.\nDuring a heat wave, there is an a outbreak of diarrhea. These regular outbreaks mainly affect children and are caused by eating rotten food and drinking polluted water; they escalate in summer when drinking water is in short supply, forcing people to use contaminated sources.\nIn the case of ground-water resource, the presence of arsenic in ground-water is affecting the people of rural areas who are largely dependent on this source of water for drinking, agriculture and livestock. Again the contaminated water and the increased salinity is affecting human health and living massively.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, arsenic-contaminated water directly affects the health of 35 million people in Bangladesh. Similarly, water crisis in Dhaka has worsened due to frequent load shedding and fall in groundwater level. The city of Dhaka experiences acute shortage of water all the year round. The city dwellers have taken it as part of their life.\nAs the demand for water increases, the share of water per person will decrease, and gradually result in greater demand for water. The internal dimension of water scarcity addresses contaminated ground and surface water. The huge populations makes the water crisis more complex.\nSimilarly, burning, deforestation, overgrazing, agricultural practices, chemical disturbance, air pollution, over-pumping of groundwater, urbanisation and industrialisation are responsible for the shortage of pure drinking water. Surface water is also polluted by the waste from industry, agriculture and human activities. About 2 million tons of wastes are dumped everyday into rivers, lakes and streams. Water is the key element of life, and when it is polluted with slow poison then it becomes dangerous.\nAbout two-thirds of the cultivable land in Bangladesh is prone to flood damage every year. Climate change has an impact on the natural, social, and economic systems of the country. A Unesco report indicates that by the middle of this century (2050), almost 2 million children will die each year for want of a glass of clean water and adequate sanitation.\nContamination of surface water bodies and groundwater aquifers by agricultural pollutants, industrial discharge and domestic pollution endangers both the natural ecosystem integrity and public health. The number of people at risk of arsenic pollution is estimated to be 90 million in a population of 150 million people.\nToday, one person in five across the world has no access to safe drinking water, and one in two to safe sanitation, more than 30,000 children die before reaching their fifth birthday, either through hunger or due to easily preventable diseases. 1.8 million people die every year from diarrhea.\n3,900 children die every day from water borne diseases. 90 percent of all deaths caused by diarrhea are of children under 5 years of age. Each year, more than five million people die from water-related disease in the world. Due to acute water crisis diarrhea becomes unpreventable in Bangladesh in summer.\nSo Bangladesh should take immediate steps to overcome the existing situation that threatens her existence. National awareness, and national and international cooperation are essential to help the country and its people build the necessary capacity and resilience.\nConserving ground water, preserving the environment to retain the natural cycle, maintaining ground water level, preventing arsenic poisoning, dredging rivers, creating embankments are necessary. Proper urbanisation and sewerage dumping also have to be ensured. So we have to tackle these issues through political will and understanding based on flexibility and harmonious water sharing, and active efforts to keep the eco-balance."

      "text": "   A herd of centrosaurs (a type of horned dinosaur) drowning in a flood millions of years ago in what is now Alberta, as depicted in this illustration THE dinosaurs may have been part of a mass die-off resulting from a monster storm, comparable to today's hurricanes, which struck what was then a coastal area.\nThe findings could help solve a mystery concerning why the badlands of western Canada are so rich in dinosaur fossils.\nThe roughly 76-million-year-old fossil beds apparently hold thousands of bones over an area of at least 568 acres (2.3 square km), skeletons that belonged to a roughly cow-sized, plant-eating horned dinosaur known as Centrosaurus. This treasure trove provides the first solid evidence that some horned dinosaur herds were much larger than previously thought, with numbers easily in the high hundreds to low thousands, said senior research scientist David Eberth, a paleontologist and geologist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Alberta.\nThe \"mega-bonebed,\" which consists of 14 smaller bonebeds, lies in northern Alberta near Hilda, Canada, right by the border with Saskatchewan. The graveyard was actually discovered in 1997, but confirmation of the discovery's size was detailed this month in the book \"New Perspectives On Horned Dinosaurs\" (Indiana University Press, 2010). [Illustration of centrosaur herd]\nAlberta is extraordinarily rich in fossils, such as those of duck-billed dinosaurs, horned dinosaurs including Triceratops, ankylosaurs, raptors related to Velociraptor, and tyrannosaurids such as Albertosaurus and Tyrannosaurus rex. The area was home to a remarkable diversity of other animals as well, including birds, pterosaurs, alligators, turtles, lizards and mammals in fact, scientists recently found mammal tooth marks on dinosaur bones in Alberta.  Thousands die in flood Back when these centrosaurs lived, Alberta was warm and lush, and encompassed lowlands on the western coast of the Western Interior Seaway, a vast inland sea that divided what is now North America in half. The way the fossils are linked together in the same layers of earth within these bonebeds suggests all these centrosaurs were wiped out simultaneously.\nThe likely culprit in this scenario was a catastrophic storm, which could quickly have routinely made the waters flood up as high as 12 to 15 feet (3.6 to 4.6 meters), if experiences with modern floodplains are any guide.\n\"The flooding could have reached more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the shoreline,\" Eberth told LiveScience. \"The landscape basically just drowns.\"\nThe flat area would have provided no high ground for escape, leading to thousands of animals drowning in the rising waters.\n\"It's unlikely that these animals could tread water for very long, so the scale of the carnage must have been breathtaking,\" Eberth said. \"The evidence suggests that after the flood, dinosaur scavengers reentered the area, trampling and smashing bones in their attempt to feast on the rotting remains.\"  Fossil mystery solved These storms could also help explain why fossils are so abundant in the badlands of western Canada overall, \"and why they are often found preserved so exquisitely,\" Eberth said.\nCoastal floodplains such as those seen in modern Bangladesh can cover vast areas, with flooding killing hundreds of thousands of livestock, not to mention the human tragedies that occur.\n\"Because of their size and the scale of the flooding, dinosaurs could not escape the coastal floodwaters and would have been killed in large numbers,\" Eberth explained. \"In contrast, fish, small reptiles, mammals, and birds may have been able to escape such seasonal catastrophes by retreating to quiet water areas, the safety of trees and burrows, or simply by flying away.\"\nThe researchers now hope to take lessons they have learned in Alberta to compare it to other parts of the world in an effort to pinpoint signs of past catastrophes elsewhere.

      "authors": "\nABMS Zahur\n",
      "text": "   Hopefully piled up: But who knows how much genuine, how much spurious.  BANGLADESH's soil fertility mainly depends on yearly flood which brings huge quantity of silt in the rivers of the country. But because of improper application of low quality chemical fertilizers the soil is losing due percentage of chemicals in fertility. It has virtually reached the lowest point, less than 1% (ideal 5%). Some officials of the department of agriculture have expressed apprehension that if the natural health of Bangladesh soil continues to deteriorate it may not be able to produce food adequately by 2020 to reach its goal.\nThe government is aware of the challenge of feeding 150 million people with diminishing arable land, and regular (almost) visitations of natural calamities. The ministry of agriculture is perhaps sparing no pains to support the agriculturists. It is, however, worried about the threat of spurious fertilizers which are (reported to be) flooding the markets, particularly the western part of the country. Its objective for attaining self-sufficiency in food needs maximum utilization of agricultural inputs, more awareness about modern cultivation in the agricultural department. However, we are hopeful with the aspiration of the government because we have strong faith in the capability of the concerned minister. Last but not the least is people's cooperation in fulfilling the objective.\nSome people are desperate about making money through unfair means despite the good intention of the government. It is reported that marketing of spurious fertilizers are growing rapidly. In a recent study by Soil Research Development Institute (SRDI) percentages of spurious fertilizers are as follows: Urea negligible; TSP-60% ; ASP-35% ; MOP-20%; DAP-30% ;\nNPKS-87% ; SOP-43%; ZS-69%; Boran-30%; AS-25%; and organic fertilizers-70%. Apart from this, entry of low quality chemicals and fertilizers also entering in to the country through unapproved routs like Chuadanga has been reported. No effective step could have been taken so far to stop this illegal trade.\nPlants get thirteen kinds of nutrients mainly from soil out of their need for sixteen kinds. Due to cultivation for a long time quality of soil deteriorates. It needs urgent study to find out the deficiency of the required chemicals in our soil. This will ultimately save fertilizers from wastage, help in maintenance of health of the soil, save it from environmental pollution and improve production.\nIn our quest for rapid increase of food production let us not ignore the necessity for guarding environmental quality. There are two dimensions in considering fertilizer's role in the environment, in its production and use. Production processes can have effects on both air and water quality. Fertilizer use also raises questions as to the fate of applied nutrients in reference to ground and stream water.\nDue to tremendous pressure of population we have to depend much on right utilization of fertilizers. It is extremely unfortunate that some of our people (in this case unscrupulous fertilizer traders) are out to frustrate the government's apparently sincere effort to boost agricultural production.\nAgriculture is the backbone of Bangladesh economy. Any adverse situation created in the sector will have profound negative effect on the whole nation directly or indirectly. The government appears to be in urgent need of taking strong punitive measures against marketing of spurious fertilizers to save the peasants, people and the country.ABMS Zahur is a retired joint secretary."

      "headline": "Exotic plantation forest: A green desert?",
      "authors": "\nDr. Md. Mizanur Rahman\n",
      "text": "   Plantations are done for several reasons including timber and fire wood production, soil and water conservation, and carbon sequestration. The role of plantations for biodiversity acceleration varies considerably depending on whether the original land cover is grassland, shrubland, primary forest, secondary forest, or degraded or exotic pasture, and whether native or exotic tree species are planted. The plantations can support biodiversity when they are established on degraded lands rather than replacing natural ecosystems like forests, grasslands, and shrublands, and when indigenous tree species are used rather than exotic species.\nThe dominance of exotic species is attributed to increased disturbance, changes in light and soil conditions, and, in some cases, changes in land management, including exclusion of grazing. The changing amounts of exotic versus native species reflect the community structure. Exotic plantations are less species rich than natural and semi-natural ecosystems (shrublands, grasslands, primary, and secondary forests). Exotic plantations support a less diverse flora and fauna compared to native plantations.\nIn most cases the influences of exotic tree plantations on some environmental parameters such as soil biogeochemistry are still largely unknown. Some species degrade soil organic matter and adversely affect soil flora and fauna. Sometime soil nutrients decline, and whole tree harvesting causes accelerated soil nutrient loss. Many exotic species are also detrimental to critical environmental factors such as soil physical properties.\nExotic monoculture tree plantations do not help to maintain landscape and biological diversity. Uniform rows of monocultural plantations are the opposite of diversity. Diversity is considered to be the primary indicator of ecosystem sustainability. Exotic trees have been found to be poor habitat for native birds. Nesters, insectivorous, and other birds that feed on fruit and nectar are particularly absent from exotic plantations. Some exotic plantations act to cut off islands of remnant indigenous forest from each other, reducing the chances of native species populations exchanging genes.\nExotic monocultures increase fire risk and can act as a source of pests and pathogens that spread into adjacent indigenous forest. Around the globe monocultures have been found to be susceptible to pests and diseases. With the narrowing of tree genetic material, increased resistance to various pests and diseases, and increased pesticide use, there is the longer-term risk that nature will retaliate and produce a whole new mutated set of insects, fungi and bacteria.\nThe living part of the soil is particularly sensitive to changes in pH. There is evidence of acidification under some exotic plantations. The nutrient removal associated with fast growing exotic plantations cause nutrient depletion of the soil and lower productivity.\nSome exotic species can be aggressive pioneer by invading adjacent ecosystems. Invasive species are characterised by having abundant and easily dispersed seed, experiencing little competition when invading new areas having an absence of natural predators and successful establishment of mutualistic relationships.\nAfforestation with exotic species alters habitat substantially for native flora and fauna with particularly strong negative effects on specialist grassland and shrubland species. Invasive exotic species compete with indigenous species and change ecosystem functioning. Environmental stress from nutrient decline and climate change will likely cause a decline in the health of monocultural tree plantations.\nOn the other hand, exotic plantation forests can result in rapid development of a forest structure beneficial for some wildlife species though it has less developed understories due to the intensity of site preparation and frequent uniformity of plantation forest structure, and can change ecological processes through litterfall and decomposition. Exotic plantations provide wildlife corridor to connect with the natural ecosystems. It is obvious that exotic plantations are far better than agriculture or urban development. Sometimes, exotics can have understory resembling native forests. Though exotic plantations do very little to conserve biodiversity, but they act as carbon sinks and conserve soil from further degradation. It is certain that higher level of biodiversity than human-modified landscapes. Exotic plantations may also support some endangered faunal species providing an alternative habitat. It often supports fewer specialist species and can play an important role in biodiversity conservation at the landscape level.\nTo potential economic revenue, exotic plantations can help restore the degraded areas where native regeneration or native plantations may otherwise be inhibited. It improves soil condition through litter production and adding humus. Through timber production, carbon sequestration and other services for ecosystem, exotic plantations of denuded lands with low biodiversity can continue to provide economic revenue. The role of exotic plantations in soil and water quality, yield, biodiversity and ecosystem health cannot be ignored. They are efficient at storing carbon dioxide in biomass and can be considered as the carbon sink.\nAn exotic plantation may produce an increase in diversity if planted into introduced grass or crop lands, or on severely degraded areas, as trees tend to increase the vertical complexity of vegetation and the structural complexity of a landscape. The tree can reduce soil erosion and cause sedimentation in adjacent water courses. Plantations can help reduce storm and peak flood water levels. They reduce stream flows working against huge erosions and act as a shelterbelt in the coastal areas. Exotic plantations in the riparian strips are currently the major area offering biodiversity protection. It can play for both diversity of stream fauna and water quality, and for providing biodiversity reserves within catchments.\nExotic plantations generally increase diversity compared to fallow, denuded, degraded, pasture and croplands. It is noteworthy to mention that exotic forests are also source to timber, industrial fibre, building materials, and provide recreation and wildlife habitat to some extents. Following the clearance of our maximum native forests, largely into agricultural lands, any type of tree plantation can be considered as the emerging major land use. Undoubtedly there are benefits from planting trees on areas of introduced pasture and cropland, such as improved protection for soils and reduced erosion, better water quality, and increased vegetation complexity.\nExotic trees can also act as a \"filter\" of the atmosphere, exchanging various gases as well as air-borne particles such as dust and rain. Some exotic trees have biological relationships that fix nitrogen from the air, as do some free growing soil bacteria and fungi. Exotic trees can contribute variable quantities of litter (dead plant matter) to the soil organic matter. This litter varies in its chemical composition, the force with which it breaks down on the soil, and the diverse range of soil flora and fauna that inhabit it. The byproducts of the litter breakdown are retained in the soil through chemical and biological processes. Nutrients such as phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium, calcium, magnesium and trace elements may be retained in a form that is not available for tree and plant growth (fixed pool), or may be in the plant available \"pool\".\nForest canopies tend to moderate soil temperatures, with further insulation from forest floor litter layers. Soil aeration can be altered by the tree roots, through them \"breathing\" or decomposing, and by changing soil porosity and density, and possibly structure. Many exotic species do not negatively impact on soil but actually benefit it. It is well known to all that any tree has some benefits to the soil, such as inception of dust, protection from the kinetic energy of rain, preventing some types of erosion, and moderation of temperature.\nWe need to restore the forests. There has been a call by the wood industry for massive global planting programmes to meet an expected demand for wood. But the industry should pause for a minute and put aside the profit margins, and should ask themselves whether the exotic plantation can fulfil the criteria of sustainability or not. Tree plantations may have many benefits over other industrial land uses, but there are ecological costs, whether present, or potential. It will be not wise to replace one unsustainable system with another. Putting all our eggs in the monoculture basket does not make sense. Alternative species and ecologically sustainable forestry systems must be pursued as a safeguard.\nMixed plantations can play the role of \"greenwash\" in the ecosystems. A considerable number of combinations are possible; usually planting higher value timber trees such Eucalypts, Acacias, Mangium and Bokain in a long rotation with selective felling regimes. The mixed species will be more responsive to site conditions, allowing the maximum use of site diversity and individual species requirements. They will provide more and better quality habitat for wildlife and if planted through a landscape plan, be more visually attractive and interesting. Woodlands could be established as patches within a predominantly agricultural landscape to assist the transition to a protected ecosystem network involving native species. However, exotic plantations can support biodiversity to some extent, even when compared to primary forest, and should not necessarily be considered as 'green deserts'."

He has tamed the nature by his knowledge and comparative physical advantages. However, in his reckless consumption spree for the sake of development and prosperity, humans have used different species in such a way that many of those have already become extinct and some others are under threat of extinction.\nAt present, humans have intensified use and production of some so-called economically valuable species ignoring others' contribution. Lately, humans have started to understand significance of ecosystem services generated by different species and estimated that 60% of the ecosystem services, accessed, are in decline due to unsustainable human actions (MA, 2005). Millennium Ecosystem Assessment warned that the cost of failure to halt biodiversity loss on land alone in last 10 years is estimated to be $ 500 billion and if the current trend of biodiversity loss continues then in near future the humanity itself will face extinction.\nTherefore, the realisation of a balanced world with all living beings' respective role has come to the forefront of the recent scientific researches. The UN has supported the awareness by declaring 2010 as International Year of Biodiversity. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has further added value to the recent worldwide movement of conserving biodiversity by setting this year's World Environment Day theme as \" Many species. One planet. One future\".\nBangladesh is endowed with very rich biodiversity resources and it is evident from its species diversity profile, particularly for angiosperms and avi-fauna. Recently published 4th National Biodiversity Report estimates that the country possesses 3,611 species of angiosperm, 2,623 belonging to 158 families of dicotyledons and, 988 to 41 families of monocotyledons. Since the country's economy is largely natural resources based, the sheer majority of the human population directly depend on its biological resources to sustain their lives and livelihoods.\nHowever, country's overwhelming population and their demand for development often compel them to pay little or no heed to biodiversity. Industrial development, expansion of agriculture, human settlements, unplanned urbanisation and rural infrastructure development all have exerted negative pressure on our environment, particularly resulting in the destruction of habitats of valuable biodiversity resources.\nClimatic change, not completely a new phenomenon but recently soared up in policy arena, is another strong factor apprehended responsible for biodiversity loss. Climate change and biodiversity exhibits an inverse relationship. Loss of biodiversity causes climate change; on the other hand, climate change induced natural calamities contribute to biodiversity loss. Bangladesh, supposedly a darling child of nature, is affected from both climate change and poverty. Consequently, its biological resources experience immense pressure; rather than being considered as natural capital, the resources are always regarded as raw materials.\nAgriculture is the world's oldest occupation and constitutes the biggest employment sector. Both basic sustenance (nutrients and calories) for people and raw materials for industries have been coming from agriculture since inception of civilization. Yet, agriculture is fundamentally dependent on biodiversity and eco-system services. Species of crops and livestock and their genetic diversity are the basis of agriculture. Even the insects contribute a lot to the agro-production. Species of earthworms, fungi, soil-micro organisms, as well as flora and fauna surrounding agricultural areas underpin ecosystem services that sustain agriculture, such as pollination and nutrient cycling.\nBeing an agrarian country, life and economy of Bangladesh are largely dependent on agriculture. In spite of introduction of mechanical agriculture, still larger farmer community practices nature dependent agriculture where they use bull to cultivate their land, earthworm as their plough, cow dung, small trees and leaves as their manure, insects as their agent of pollination and so forth. Every component of the natural environment works as their helping agent in agricultural production. Even if so-called green revolution has been given credit for alleviating poverty and providing food to the country's large population , but recent food crisis has depicted an opposing scenario where mechanised agriculture, which pay little attention to biodiversity, has been blamed for degrading environmental quality and consequently the production decline.\nIntensified production system using only few varities, dominates the current agriculture production system. Even though presence of more than 10,000 rice varieties in the country is a clear example of our vast wealth of genetic resources, but now there are only ten types of local rice in production practice and this sector has been dominated by High Yielding Varieties (HYV) which need an intensive use of fertilizers, insecticides and so on resulting in an adverse impact on the surrounding environment. Once abundant, fish resources might be the most affected by synthetic agri input.\nTogether with the staple rice small amounts of vegetable and fish constitute the everyday diet of overwhelming majority population of Bangladesh. Moreover, fisheries are important occupation of many of the rural poor, constituting main income source for near about 2 million households. Flood plains, rivers, streams, canals, beels and ponds in Bangladesh are equipped with 260 species of fresh water fish resources. Among them, 140 species are classified as small indigenous fish species. Moreover, a considerable number of estuarine and marine fish species have enriched country's fish resource stocks. However, overcatch, destruction of habitat, pollution, conversion of wetlands to alternative uses have resulted in extinction of many fish species and subsequent wild catch has declined sharply in recent years.\nThe extinction of local fish species and associated decreased production has affected poor people's diet mostly. Millions of poor rural people are now suffering from malnutrition, who once were dependent on fish to meet their protein demand. Interestingly, official statistics estimate that total fish production has been increasing; this is due to aquaculture practice with some fast growing hybrid and exotic fish species. Regrettably, many of the widely cultivated exotic fish species have been identified as invasive and they exert negative externalities to our local ecosystem. Moreover, poor people have limited or no access to such commercial fish culture. And they cannot afford fish from the market due to high prices. Many of the rural poor cannot even remember now when they had fish last time.\nForests provide food and vast array of materials for medicinal, cultural and spiritual purposes as well as building materials and firewood, more specifically the poor is the primary beneficiary from the forest. It is estimated that one billion people worldwide depend on drugs derived from forest plants. Moreover, by providing home to a large number of birds and wildlife forests play an important role to conserve valuable biodiversity resources. Forests' ecological, social and economic functions are also praiseworthy. Forests store and purify drinking water, protect watershed, mitigate natural disasters, and control erosion, cycle nutrients, help to store carbon and to regulate climate and contribute to the regional and national economies both directly through revenues, value adding and employment.\nEven if Bangladesh is a forest poor country, only 6% of country's total land is forest covered, yet it is very rich in species diversity. The hill forest alone supports 2,259 species of angiosperm. Sundarbans, world's largest single mangrove block and a world heritage site, is a unique habitat of spectacular Royal Bengal Tiger. Being the most bio-diverse forest in Bangladesh, Sundarbans alone supports 53% of birds, 43% of animals, 42% of reptiles, 36% of amphibians, 29% of plants and 17% of fish species of the country's total biodiversity resources.\nHowever, Bangladesh's forests have decreased significantly in terms of both area and quality over the last few decades. The annual deforestation rate is estimated to be around 3.3% (Khan et al. 2004). Number of factors are responsible for forest degradation. The increasing population and associated increased demand for timber, shelter, food continues to put pressure on existing forest resources resulting in over exploitations. Moreover, introduction of some exotic species such as Eucalyptus, Acacia etc. and their wide plantation is another important cause of some native species' extinction. These exotic species neither fitted with local environment nor support birds or any wildlife. Additionally, these have introduced some pests, which incur a huge loss every year.\nEvery year about 20% new settlements are being added at the expense of productive homestead agriculture and forest lands, which basically used to provide food and livelihood to the rural poor. Homestead ecosystem is also very important for providing shelter to wildlife. With dwindling forest cover, this importance is becoming far more significant. Most of the small mammals and birds still existing in the country are completely dependent on this ecosystem, including agricultural land for their survival.\nAgain, culture and biological diversity are closely intertwined. Biodiversity remains at the centre of many religions and culture. The close association between biodiversity and culture is particularly apparent at sacred sites -- areas which are held to be of importance because of their religious and spiritual significance. In Bangladesh, there is a significant diversity in ecosystem, culture, especially rural and indigenous culture, which is the centre of attraction to many tourists.\nWe do not have another planet to depend on, except this mother earth. The earth is still livable and beautiful because it has many species, who perform different functions to keep the earth functioning. All the species have been created for serving and supporting human beings as argued by many religions. Biodiversity loss, therefore, will eventually lead to human extinction. We have to protect all the species for our own sake, for keeping the world colourful and, above all, surviving. "

      "text": "The Jessore Road earned its name for being a crucial communication link between the eastern and western parts of Bengal. But it reappeared with a new significance in September 1971 when millions used it as a highway to life, defying natural calamities, to evade Pakistani atrocities.\nNearly 10 million people fled the country for a makeshift refuge in neighbouring India as Pakistani troops launched a cleansing campaign. Most of the people in the western region chose Jessore Road as a safe passage particularly in September - a very difficult time when the country witnessed a late monsoon deluge.\nMany people left aside their ailing minors or elderly dear ones, dead in the mud, to bear for a lifetime in agony. Others lost their lives to enemy bullets or were captured by razakars to languish in captivity. Jessore Road, which linked Bangladesh's Jessore with West Bengal's Kolkata, was the witness of many such untold stories.\nFurthermore late monsoon flood aggravated the sufferings of the people fleeing their homes, drawing attention of world media for the cause of Bangladesh alongside the empathy of artistes, musicians and poets.\nJessore Road appeared to be a topic of war and refugee migration. Foreign journalists and aid workers reported on it, singers composed music and great poets wrote poetry about it. Their hearts were touched by the miseries of people, fleeing their homes for life.\nUS poet Allen Ginsberg was one of them who captured the history in his great poem \"September on Jessore Road\" which was recited at a poetry recitation programme in St George Church of New York. His close friend legendary pop star Bob Dylan later gave it a musical form to be sung at a concert for Bangladesh afterwards.\n\"Millions of babies watching the skies/ Bellies swollen, with big round eyes/ On Jessore Roadlong bamboo huts/ No place to shit but sand channel ruts. . . Millions of babies in pain/ Millions of mothers in rain/ Millions of brothers in woe/ Millions of children nowhere to go.\nThe poet also sharply criticised the role of his own country, the United States, with its top leaders opposing Bangladesh's cause. He wrote, \"American Angel machine please come fast! / Where is Ambassador Bunker today? / Are his Helios machine gunning children at play?\"\nIndian singer Mausumi Bhaumik sang the Bangla version of the song \"September on Jessore Road\", giving it an extra touch of emotion while youtube launched another version of Bhaumik's rendering along with a visual footage of captured motion pictures of refugee migration.\n\"Taxi September along Jessore Road/ Oxcart skeletons drag charcoal load/ past watery fields through rain flood ruts/ Dung cakes on tree trunks, plastic-roof huts.\" This is the way Ginsberg's poetry depicted the scene at that time."

      "text": "   Castles made of sand: Are these houses on land or water? Photo: Amdadul Huq/ drik news DHAKA is expanding in all directions. The city's master plan, the Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan (DMDP), has two parts. The Dhaka Structure Plan is valid from 1995-2015, whereas the Urban Area Plan was valid from 1995-2005. The plan considers keeping at least eight flood-flow zones undisturbed -- Dhaka West, DND Triangle, Eastern Fringe polders, Kamrangir Char, Jinjira, Narayanganj West, Dhaka NW, and Narayanganj East.\nUnfortunately, this is not happening. Already, unscrupulous developers have filled a number of flood-flow zones, something that Rajuk has failed to prevent (Ferdousi, 2006). Low-lying areas and flood-flow zones are encroached by both public and private sector-initiated housing projects. Flora and fauna are decreasing, cultivable land area is shrinking, and crop production has come down by a considerable amount over the decades (Rahman, 2007).\nThe city's eastern part regularly goes under water during the rainy season. This part also holds rainwater runoff for a large part of the city through natural drains. During the last decade, about 19 housing projects were initiated in the eastern fringe. It is expected that all housing projects will be implemented in the next 10 years. Most of these estates were developed by filling low land with sand, soil and solid waste.\nAn analysis of IRS image of 1996 and IRS image of 2000 clearly shows that water bodies measuring about 2,300 sq. metres were filled in during the development of Bashundhara and Bashumoti housing estates. Similarly, for Aftabnagar Housing branches of natural drains and large water bodies, covering an area of 66 acres, were lost due to housing development.\nIn the southern part of Buriganga river, Rajuk (the capital development authority) initiated a residential project on an area of 381 acres. The project site used to remain under water most of the year. The site is demarcated as a water-retention pond in the Dhaka Master Plan. Over the last two years, this area was filled for a housing development. Apart from this, about 3,000 sq. metres of natural water bodies have already disappeared during the Riverview Housing Estate development on the Buriganga River bank's southern fringe (Rahman, 2007).\nIn western Dhaka, housing estates were initiated over the last two decades. In 1996, there were 211 acres of water bodies in the Mohammedia housing estate and Adabbor area. During development, about 91 acres of water bodies disappeared between 1996 and 2006 and 68 acres between 2006 and 2009.\nSince Dhaka is developing fast, and without proper guidance, we may see more cases like the June 1 Begunbari building collapse -- where buildings are constructed on marshy land -- or during an earthquake where soil liquefaction may devastate the city.\nLiquefaction is a physical process of ground failure that takes place during some earthquakes. Because of liquefaction, soft, young, water-saturated, well-sorted, fine grain sands and silt behave as viscous fluids, rather than solids. If pore-space water pressure increases to the point where the soil's shear strength no longer supports the weight of the overlying soil, buildings, roads, houses, etc., then the soil flows like a liquid and causes extensive surface damage.\nOn September 19, 1985, an earthquake struck Mexico City, with a magnitude of 8.1 on the Richter scale. The earthquake's epicenter was 240 miles from the city. Since Mexico City is situated on land once covered by Lake Texcoco and was filled in for habitation, hundreds of city buildings collapsed due to the heavy shaking of the ground and the quake's long duration, which lasted three to four minutes. Similarly, for the Niigata earthquake and the Alaska earthquake, also of 1964, liquefaction phenomena devastated the cities. Hundreds of buildings collapsed and were damaged due to its affects.\nA recent study by Comprehensive Disaster Management Program (CDMP) on the liquefaction susceptibility of Dhaka indicates that the city's eastern and southwestern parts lie within the high to very high liquefaction susceptibility range. These parts are recently filled and developed marshy lands.\nThe CDMP study also identified several active faults within Bangladesh, based on historical events and evidence from geological investigations. The Madhupur and Dauki faults, about 90 and 230 miles, respectively, from Dhaka, are those identified by experts. The 1985 Mexico City earthquake caused a considerable amount of damage, even though the source was 240 miles from the city.\nIn Dhaka, an earthquake from either Madhupur or Dauki may cause severe liquefaction effects to buildings, especially those developed on marshy lands on the eastern and western fringes, and even within the city in the infill areas like Begunbari, part of Mirpur etc.\nProper land-use control mechanism is required to ensure Dhaka's future development, considering the possible liquefaction effects of earthquakes. In-depth studies and research in this regard would be helpful for the preparing Dhaka's development in the coming decade.Md.

Photo Courtesy: PMO  Former Indian premier Indira Gandhi was yesterday conferred the \"Bangladesh Freedom Honour\" for her unparalleled support and contributions to Bangladesh's Liberation War in 1971.\nHer daughter-in-law also president of India's ruling Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, received the posthumous award from Bangladesh President Zillur Rahman on behalf of Indira Gandhi at a ceremony in Bangabhaban.\nIndira Gandhi is the first among the foreign friends of Bangladesh to be conferred the highest state honour.\nExpressing her heartfelt thanks for the honour, Sonia recalled the tumultuous days of 1971 when her mother-in-law took a firm stance to side with the Bangalee people fighting to establish their own country.\n\"If Indira Gandhi could have been with us, I know she would have been overwhelmed by the high honour you have bestowed on her,\" Sonia said.\n\"There can be no honour higher than the one conferred for the freedom of an oppressed people and the birth of a great nation,\" she said.\nShe said she felt humble and privileged but also proud to accept the award on her mother-in-law's behalf. \"I do so with a very full heart and consciousness that the honour is not her alone but also India's, and in a sense yours as well.\"\nShe said she came to Bangladesh not just to visit another country.\n\"Memories and emotions flood my mind. My husband and I were present at the airport along with Indira Ji amid massive crowds on the historic morning on January 10, 1972, when Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was welcomed in Delhi on his way to his newly free country,\" recalled Sonia.\n\"The amount of excitement and sense of optimism, indeed the knowledge that history was being made, I can never forget,\" she said.\nSonia concluded her speech by saying, \"Joy Bangla, Joy Bangladesh-India friendship.\"\nPresident Zillur Rahman said, \"This is a very special and historic occasion for us, an occasion that will certainly be written in golden letters in the history of both of our nations.\"\nHe said Indira Gandhi inspired millions of Bangladeshis and Indians to fight against all oppression and injustice.\n\"She launched an intense and bold diplomatic move for Bangladesh, despite challenges by some major powers. She also vigorously pursued the Pakistani authority for safe release of Bangabandhu,\" he said.\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina described Indira Gandhi as a true and great friend of Bangladesh, its people, and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\n\"On Bangabandhu's request, she withdrew the Indian soldiers within three months of Bangladesh's independence. That was a unique gesture of Mrs Indira Gandhi,\" Hasina said.\n\"We are delighted to honour her with our highest award,\" she said, recalling the eventful days of Bangladesh's liberation war in 1971.\nShe said Indira Gandhi travelled the world to rally support of the world community for the independence of Bangladesh, and for saving the life of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was then facing capital punishment in a Pakistani jail.\nForeign Minister Dipu Moni said, \"We are here to honour a friend who played the most critical role among all our foreign friends in our nation's journey to statehood. Indira Gandhi changed the course of events in the fateful months of 1971. And with the support she gave to our embattled people, the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh was born. Today we are here to recognise and express our gratitude, and to honour Indira Gandhi.\"\nThe award's teak frame contains two gold plates on both sides of a folded box. Fifty-year-old teak, preserved by the Department of Forest, has been used for the frame.\nSreemati Indira Gandhi's name is inscribed on the plate on the left side in Bangla and English while the plate on the right has the signatures of Bangladesh President Zillur Rahman and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\nThe plate on the left mentions that the award was conferred as the highest token of respect and gratitude of the Bangalee nation to Indira Gandhi for her immense contribution to Bangladesh's War of Independence.\nA brief audio-visual documentary was played at the 50-minute ceremony which showed images of Bangladesh's Liberation War, Indira Gandhi's activities during that period, and some of her moments with Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The documentary made the audience quite emotional.\nThe entrance of Bangabhaban was decorated with pictures depicting historic moments of Indira Gandhi during Bangladesh's struggle for liberation. Both Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Sonia Gandhi saw the pictures with curiosity.\nState Minister for Liberation War Affairs Capt (retd) AB Tajul Islam gave the welcome speech. A large number of dignitaries including some foreign guests were present at the ceremony.\nCabinet Secretary M Abdul Aziz read out the citation conferred on Indira Gandhi.\nThe event concluded with the playing of the national anthem of Bangladesh.\nIndira Gandhi was the third prime minister of India for three consecutive terms from 1966 to 1977, and for a fourth term from 1980 until her assassination in 1984.

Photo: STAR Saline water that entered Barisal region during tidal surges from Sunday to Tuesday caused extensive damage to seasonal crops on thousand of hectares of land.\nThe Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) in Barisal said seasonal crops on 15,972 hectares of land in 11 districts under the DAE region went under saline water due to tidal surges during the three days, reports our Barisal correspondent.\nDamaged crops include watermelon on 1,015 hectares, pepper on 3,530 hectares, different types of pulses on 8,478 hectares, til on 1,184 hectares, ground-nut on 127 hectares, vegetables on 452 hectares, sweet potato on 489 hectares, soybean on 210 hectares, corn on 48 hectares, sunflower on 19 hectares, chickpea on 145 hectares and other varieties of crops on 275 hectares of land.\nOf the 11 districts under Barisal DAE, Patuakhali saw the most serious damage where crops on 7,445 hectares of land have already been destroyed.\nBesides, crops on 2,862 hectares in Jhalakathi district, 2,711 hectares in Barisal, 2,227 hectares in Bhola district got damaged, said Shah Alam, additional director DAE in Barisal.\n\"The sudden rise in water level has been caused under the influence of full moon that is nearest to the earth in recent days. It may also be related with climate change after recent earthquakes and tsunami in Japan,\" said Mahfuzur Rahman, executive engineer of Bhola office of Bangladesh Water Development Board.\n\"Watermelon is cultivated in a large scale on the char areas and riverbanks of Charfession, Lalmohan, Manpura under Bhola district and Baufal, Galachipa of Patuakhali district but the tidal surge affected it badly,\" said Ganesh Datta, a watermelon wholesaler in Barisal.\nOur Patuakhali Correspondent adds: The district has become the worst affected due to the tidal surges that flooded the coastal areas from Sunday to Tuesday.\nRobi crops on nearly 8,000 hectares of land in seven upazilas of Patuakhali district got damaged due to infiltration of saline water by recent tidal surges.\nDAE sources said 1,66,283 hectares of land in the district was brought under robi cultivation. Local farmers cultivated different robi crops like watermelon, melon, sweet potato, chilli, lentil, kidney bean, ground nut, oil seeds including mustard in the area.\nMainly the lands outside flood control embankments were flooded by three to five feet tidal surge that damaged all kinds of robi crops, said AZM Momtazul Karim, deputy director (DD) of Patuakhali DAE.\nOf damaged crops watermelon damaged in large scale and watermelon cultivated on 8,188 hectares land in the district, he added.\nTidal surge usually does not rise so high in this season but this time water level increased much higher than previous years, he said.\n\"We demand building flood control embankments in the area to save crops from tidal surge,\" Abu Bakar, 45, a farmer of Chaka Moina village under Kalapara upazila, who lost robi crops on four acres of land.\nLike them, about 4,000 farmers including a good number of marginal farmers are now frustrated as their robi crops have been damaged by recent tidal surges in seven upazilas of the district."

      "text": "It is forty years since the birth of Bangladesh. During this time the country has travelled from Henry Kissinger's basket case to being almost a granary. From a non-existent industrial base it has moved to a country which produces much of its essential consumer items.\nOur exports have burgeoned to an astonishing $16 billion each year and our imports to $21 billion annually. We now have foreign exchange reserves that can meet five months of import requirements. Remittances from our 8 million workers abroad amount to $11 billion each year, in spite of a world wide economic recession. Our economy is on course for near 7% GDP growth in financial 2011 alone.\nLook at our society at large. We have people from four different religious persuasions living side by side. Yet we do not have communal troubles. Terrorism in general is rare and religious extremism is on the wane. We are a democratic polity that has been voting regularly in elections since 1991. We have a vibrant media as well as a dynamic civil society. We Bangladeshis articulate our views on every subject on earth and can get away with verbal murder.\nAlthough nature is not always kind to us, we Bangladeshis have survived natural calamities like flood, cyclone and drought at regular intervals. The people and our institutions have shown extreme resilience to disasters. We have demonstrated how much we are able to bear the burden of extreme pain and misery and then get on with our life.\nAlthough we remain poor by any international standard, we are working to achieve middle income status by 2021. Our social indicators are well on the way to meeting Millennium goals. The people of Bangladesh who were once derided for being unfit for military service, have been fielding one of the largest UN peace-keeping forces for several years.\nWe have a Nobel Peace Prize recipient from among us. There are two Bangladeshis who have scaled Mount Everest and we also have a Test playing cricket team. We have given the world the winning concept of microcredit which has now swept into 100 countries and made Bangladesh a household name in poverty alleviation and women empowerment. And don't forget we have protected the world famous Royal Bengal Tiger in our Sundarban and a Bangladeshi has mapped out the sequencing of the jute genome.\nSo how have we been able to do all this in spite of all the constraints?\nThose of us who were privileged to visit or stay abroad for long periods in different countries have come back to Bangladesh to realise that in several matters we seem to be better than many other countries in the world.\nTake the case of our people. Bangladeshis are known for their simplicity, intelligence and spirituality. It is not that we do not have bad eggs among us. But time and again we have proved ourselves extremely reliable in many areas.\nMany people do not know that Bangladesh is a world class paymaster. We have never defaulted on our international debts. We have also never overcharged our international trading partners. In fact, in many cases we have made the least possible profits only to get business for ourselves. Our manpower has also charged less in spite of having the same or similar qualifications as workers from our region. Our private sector is becoming a darling to many around the world.\nIt is in this context that Bangladesh needs to now assess its own characterisations, which also happen to be elements of soft power. We need to see if we can use them cleverly for our own good in the future.\nBut what is soft power?\nSoft power is the ability to get what you want, through attraction rather than coercion. It arises from the attractiveness of a country's culture, political ideals and policies. When our policies are seen as legitimate in the eyes of others, our soft power is enhanced. It is much more than \"image, public relations and ephemeral popularity.\" It constitutes very real power -- a possibility to attain national objectives in a global context by a country.\nIt was Joseph Nye an American who in his seminal book on soft power outlined this concept and its ramifications. For example Nye says that Chinese students demonstrating in Tiananmen Square in Beijing used a replica of the Statue of Liberty as a symbol, and the Afghans fighting the Soviets asked for a copy of the Bill of Rights. The Chinese are now using soft power to make themselves welcome throughout the world.\nThus, when you get others to admire your ideals and to want what you want, you do not have to spend as much on sticks and carrots (hard power) to move them in your direction. Seduction is always more effective than coercion.\nFormer US House Speaker Newt Gingerich aptly described the concept of soft power when he said: \"The real key is not how many enemy do I kill. The real key is how many alliances do I gain.\"\nBut doing this requires well designed strategies and skillful leadership. Yet strategies are often inadequate and leaders frequently misjudge.\nThus, if Bangladesh wishes to use soft power in international politics it has to display its dominant values, internal practices and policies and the manner of conducting foreign relations. If a country's culture and ideology are attractive, other nations are more willing to follow. Precepts and teachings found in the literature of Tagore, Nazrul and Jashimuddin could be significant sources of our soft power.\nAll power has limits and soft power is no exception. It is much dependent upon the existence of willing interpreters as well as receivers of the power. Soft power is also volatile. Public perceptions of another country's values can change quickly.\nBut in all fairness it must be said that the attractiveness of Bangladesh to others is a composite of different ideas and attitudes. It lies partly in culture, in part on domestic policies and values and in part on the substance and style of our foreign policy. In any case, soft power is never static.\nSo how does one generate and effectively apply soft power?\nWe know that soft power resources are usually outside the control of governments. They are in the hands of individuals and non-governmental organisations. Soft power, therefore, works indirectly and can only shape the environment for policy. It can take years to produce desired results. But the government of Bangladesh through the conduct of cultural diplomacy and public diplomacy can enhance the image of the country and bring quick results.\nThe Bangladesh Diaspora is an effective medium to showcase our soft power. The internet can also bring many of our ideas and ideology to the attention of foreigners.\nSetting up more libraries and information centeres both at home and abroad as well as translating more Bangla literature into English are the other ways to project Bangladesh's soft power. Our visual and performing arts, fashion, cuisine and folk tales are also elements of this power.\nIn the long run it is our soft power or the attractiveness of Bangladesh through its ideas, ideologies and interests that can help us climb higher in rank among the comity of nations. The concept of Grameen has shown the way.\nAre we willing to build on such success and race ahead to further glory?"

      "text": "   Bio-villagers attending a monthly meeting. Bio-village means a village/territory where community people would live and breathe in nature and foster the biodiversified ecological balance. In this environment, they will practice organic farming, where natural fertilizers and seed could be used.\nMost important features for considering a bio-village are: Ensuring protection of water resources, best utilization of cultivated land, conservation of environment and ecological balance, local/original fishery cultivation, poultry rearing, tree plantation. New technology and innovation must be practiced for monitoring the impact of these on total ecological and agricultural development, followed by using IPM and bio-pesticide; emphasizing environment friendly horticulture and crop cultivation; ensuring health, hygiene, fresh water supply and sanitation, infrastructure development and ensuring supply of energy, power and utility services.\nBio-village is an ideal model for everlasting sustainability of economy, community development and environmental sanctuary issues. BSafe and International Rice Research Institute jointly have taken an ideal to set up a model bio-village combining three villages of Manikgang. Apiculture and bee keeping as income generating activities, -vermi-compost preparation and its utilization, neem tree plantation, bio pesticide, use of importance of medicinal herb planting are important features of this bio-village project .\nDanestapur, Kuestara and Kantapara, the three villages of Bolra Union under Horirampur Thana of Manikgonj have been projected for setting up the bio-village construction of which would be the first formal bio-village project in Bangladesh.\nDr. M.Zainul Abedin, IRRI Representative for Bangladesh said, \"Needless to say, environment friendly cultivation would uplift the farming and increase the crop production. IRRI's contribution to Bangladesh agriculture has passed 50 years already. Over this time we have been trying to innovate new genre of rice, bio technologies and others. But the project of bio-village is a new initiative\".\nDr. Abedin further commented, \"This project would create income generation in the three villages along with other areas and also women empowerment is a great factor inherent in this\".\nInitially, about 1200 families of the three project villages will be directly involved and indirect empowerment will also be created when the infrastructure development would take place.\nDKK Social Fishery Project is another feature of this village where fish cultivation will be practiced in the farmlands during the rainy season. Cultivation in floodplains areas would increase the soil fertility and decrease the total cost of agricultural crop production.\nSakiul Millat Morshed, Executive Director of SHISUK a local partner NGO considered \"this project simultaneously would project the agriculture and fishery as well as pave way for nourishment of the young generation. When the project would be successful, it will be an ideal inspiration to set up more bio villages in rural areas\".\nMd. Ataur Rahman, Country Director of Hunger Free World considered \"this project would definitely provide safety, security and certainty for better life and conservation of biodiversity as well as ecological balance. As our country is facing a negative impact of the climate change, this initiative would obviously and dynamically formulate an environment friendly and economically viable condition for the rural people.\nBio-village is a part of IRRI Bangladesh's Sustainable Soil Management initiative for food security of poor, marginal and small farmers of active flood plains and char lands of Bangladesh (SUSFER ) project. This project has been taken to improve food security and increase the supply of nutritionally rich food to poor, marginal and small farming households of the active flood plains and char lands under the project areas. Capacity building of farmers and best utilization of existing resources is the key to achieve sustainable growth in agriculture. SUSFER project is working to strengthen farming activities by transferring technologies and implementing new initiatives, of course, environment friendly."

      "text": "India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bhutan have planned 552 hydropower projects in the Himalayas. Some of these are under construction, some have been completed and still others are on the drawing board. When they are implemented some of them will impact Bangladesh.\nThe Himalayan mountain range is the centre point from which scores of Asian rivers originate. The Ganges, Brahmaputra and the tributary of Irabarti are the major rivers that also flow through Bangladesh. Our country shares waters of 54 rivers with India and 3 with Myanmar.\nIf upstream countries divert normal water flow through dams, we will see many of our rivers dry up, our irrigation system destroyed and life killed in our water bodies. If the water flowing through these common rivers is not managed well, it can flood a large part of Bangladesh each year.\nIndia is planning and implementing several projects to dam up our common rivers. The fact is that we are not even taken into confidence about their intentions. We are not privy to the progress made in the projects upstream.\nWhen a dam is built, the river valley is first tampered with and there is a great loss of habitat there. Second, the dam leads to a change in the morphology of the downstream river bed and (in our case) the delta. Our coastline changes too, due to changed sediment load. An important aspect is change in the quality of water downstream. The nutrient load of a river is depleted. Biodiversity, which is unique to a river, then changes as organisms begin to flow in low quantities.\nAll these changes also lead to changes in climate conditions. Siltation occurs with variation in water table, and aquatic life is disturbed in the lower riparian areas. There is little or no recharge of ground water aquifers and therefore there is a rise in pollution. However, the greatest effect is on the socio-economic environment. Due to less water available downstream, there is little or no employment. People have less drinking water. Production in factories slows down too. The economy can go into a tail spin. Public agitation begins. People start to move to areas where more water is available. Internal migration becomes the norm and the state is forced to rehabilitate masses of people in already crowded areas.\nUnder these circumstances, Bangladesh needs to craft a trans-boundary water policy, if it does not want to face future political and economic chaos.\nBut before we do that we need to first understand the legal principles which guide the regime of trans-boundary rivers. The principle of equitable use of trans-boundary water resources and the obligation not to cause harm in the management of trans-boundary water resources must be understood. There are these three different paths towards these goals:\nSigning treaties or agreements that just stop short of allocating water between riparian states. These are treaties that define navigation rights of the states through which the river runs through or to combat pollution in the common river;\nInitialing agreements allocating water between states;\nSigning agreements for joint management of internationally shared rivers.\nA river is described as international if it flows geographically through or between territories of sovereign states. From a legal point of view, any river becomes international if a riparian state does not have all the powers over the waters of that river. In Bangladesh, we have no control over the flow of 57 rivers flowing through our territory, out of a total of 800 rivers and tributaries.\nThe UN Convention on the Law of Non-navigational Uses of International Water Courses (yet to be in force) provides a framework for cooperation within international river basins. From the first century of the present millennium there have been more than 3,600 instruments relating to international water courses. Some 286 international agreements or treaties are also in place. However, most treaties concerning shared waters are bilateral and relate to specific rivers.\nTreaties are guided by customary international law or state practice. Such guidelines are based on one or more of the following doctrines:\n1) Harmon Doctrine of Absolute Sovereignty: This claims absolute freedom of a riparian state, often the upper riparian. However, this has never got international acceptance;\n2) Doctrine of Absolute Riverian Integrity: Here a state may not alter the natural flow of a river passing through its territory in any manner that will affect the water in another state;\n3) Doctrine of Limited Territorial Sovereignty: This happens to be the most accepted doctrine in resolving international water disputes. It follows the general legal obligation to use ones property in a manner that it will not cause injury to others;\n4) Doctrine of Communality of International Waters: This treats the total volume of basin water (in our case we have three river basins : the Padma, the Meghna and the Brahmaputra) as a shared resource. Each river basin is a single geographic and economic unit that overlaps two or more states, and its resources from the rivers must be shared.\n5) Doctrine of Correlative Rights: This emphasises the best utilisation of joint water resources rather than on ownership rights.\nFrom these doctrines, certain legal norms have evolved. They are:\nThe duty to cooperate and negotiate;\nProhibition of practices that can cause major injuries to other states (like Tipaimukh Dam);\nThe duty to prior consultation; and\nPrinciple of equitable utilisation of shared resources.\nWe must therefore choose from the above and firm up our position. We must also seek out the legal international norms that will protect our national interest when we sit down to manage the freshwater resource flowing through our land. Several experts have said that we may embrace a combination of the Doctrine of Limited Territorial Sovereignty, the Doctrine of Communality of International Waters and the Doctrine of Correlative Rights.\nOur diplomats and water experts should brainstorm intensively with politicians to craft the most appropriate trans-boundary water policy. We have very little time in hand, as India is rushing to build structures as well as work on river linking projects. Any structure that will divert the waters of the common rivers would mean disaster for Bangladesh. We are already faced with the vicissitudes of climate change. We cannot afford a double jeopardy.\nWe may also consult with international legal experts, the World Bank and other multilateral agencies. If need be we should raise our voice in the United Nations or take our case to the International Court to get our rights established, if bilateral negotiations are purposely delayed or adverse outcomes are anticipated.\nIn this matter, we are reminded of a saying by Franklin Roosevelt: \"To reach a port, we must sail -- not tie at anchor. Sail and not drift.\" Today, our water policy must not remain adrift."

The photo was taken from a flood plain in Shahjadapur union of Sarail upazila under Brahmanbaria district recently.Photo: STAR With water receding from flood plane and low lying areas, the end of the rainy season sees widespread catching of small indigenous fishes, including young ones, much to the harm of fish stock in different areas of the district.\nAccording to district fisheries office sources, there are 48,000 hectares of flood plane and 56,327 hectares of open water bodies including 176 beels (large water bodies) in the district.\nDuring the rainy season, various fishes including indigenous ones enter the flood planes and beels where they breed and grow up by eating natural foods.\nDifferent kinds of local fishes including dankina, tith puti, dela, chalia, chang lata, balitura, ektuta kakila, elong, kuksa, hiralo, chabchela, anju, modu dankina, bata, tatkini, sor puti, kanchon puti, jili puti, jat puti, teri puti, kala bata, panga, phari gutum, rani, puma, rita, sing, magur, pabda, bash pata, bacha, kaliara, chanda, naftani, koi, baicha, gura chanda, meni, bailla, naptani, and baim have already become rare here.\nDistrict fisheries office released 445 kg fry of small indigenous fishes at open water body during last rainy season to help their breeding and protect the species from extinction.\nThe authorities also released 4,653 kg of fry of different varieties of big fishes to increase the fish production in the district. Four billboards were also erected to create awareness among the common people.\nThe villagers were also asked not to catch fish fry and not to use current net for fishing. But they hardly follow the instruction.\nDuring visit to several spots in the district, this correspondent found the villagers indiscriminately catching different kinds of fishes with nets, traps, hooks and rods. The children were seen catching fishes by making several holes under knee deep water in the mud where the fish take shelter after being chased by the kids in large area covered with knee deep water.\nAccording to district fisheries office sources, 42,248 tonnes of fishes are produced in the district but the present demand is a bit higher.\nOf the amount, 15,615 tonnes come from open water bodies but indiscriminate fishing leaves the fish stock in a vulnerable position.\nTo protect the small indigenous fishes by providing them suitable environment for breeding, two fish sanctuaries have been set up in Titas River -- one near Kainchonpur Bazar in Sadar upazila and the other at Kagmari village under Banchharampur upazila.\nHowever, no such initiative has been taken in seven other upazilas under the district.\nA section of unscrupulous villagers secretly catch fish even from the fish sanctuaries, hampering fish breeding.\n\"Once we caught huge amount of small indigenous fishes as well as a good number of big fishes by boat from Beel Shapla but it is only a dream now. Still the government earns over Tk 15 lakh yearly revenue from the fishermen who take lease of the beel,\" said Probhat Chandra Das, a fisherman of Shahjadapur village.\n\"We are gradually being dependent on farm fishes like pangas and telapia because small indigenous fishes are being exhausted due to random fishing by people. Besides, some 'hunter' fishes like Thai magur and piranha causes immense harm to the fish stock,\" Porimal Das, a village doctor, said.\nTo prevent illegal catching of fish including fry, at least eight mobile courts were set up during last rainy season and 70,000 metres of current net were burnt, said Sawpon Kumar Sarker, district fisheries officer.\nGradually all the upazilas of the district will be taken under the fish sanctuary project to save all kinds of small indigenous fishes and the young ones of big fishes, he said."

Photo: Star Land developers are illegally filling up vast areas of wetland and converting huge areas of seasonal cropland to launch housing projects along the Dhaka-Mawa Highway.\nAll the laws and policies formulated over the years to protect the environment have simply become a farce as the authorities concerned are turning a blind eye to the misdeed.\nDuring several recent visits to Shikarpur beel, Kuichhamara beel, Abdullahpur, Alampur, Rajendrapur in Sirajdikhan, Srinagar and Lauhajong in Munshiganj, it was seen that influential land developers were filling up thousands of acres of land.\nThe land developers have also erected hundreds of colourful billboards in the water, bearing advertisements like \"green model town\" or \"modern town\" to lure prospective buyers. Even in September this year, locals caught fish and sailed boats around those billboards posted by different housing projects like \"green city\", \"silver city\", \"Padma city\", \"modern city\", \"Asian town\" or \"shanti nibas\".\nThe roadside views are the same for a stretch of a few kilometres on both sides of the highway.\nThe vast areas of low land remain four to five months under water where locals catch fish during monsoon and cultivate rice and vegetables in winter.\nThat had been in practice for generations, said Khaleque Morol of Baro Shikarpur in Srinagar while talking to this correspondent.\nKhaleque was allegedly forced to sell his land to Amin Mohammad Foundation.\n\"I was compelled to sell my 140 decimals of land as they were threatening to fill it up. If they filled up my land with sand, I could not grow anything there. Rather they would have asked me to pay for the sand, which they have done to others,\" alleged Khaleque.\n\"They just make people hostage and force them to sell their land,\" said Khaleque, who now has no land except his homestead and has become jobless.\nTwo men were seen fishing on a boat fastened to a big signboard of Amin Mohammad Foundation near Bara Shikarpur village. The billboard reads, \"Modern city with all facilities, only five kilometres away from Babu Bazar bridge...\"\nThe older of the men said, \"Now rivers, wetland, cropland -- everything is turning into housing projects. Here, the depth would not be less than five to six feet. Our beel too is turning into a housing scheme.\"\nDr Ishrat Islam of Department of Urban and Regional Planning, Buet has recently showed that nearly 10,000 acres of wetland was filled up in Dhaka city and its fringes every year between 1999 and 2010. Before that, around 13,000 acres of wetland was filled up each year between 1989 and 1999.\nThe Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act, 1995 (Amended 2010) and other related laws prohibit converting any land into housing estates without prior permission. But in most cases the land was filled up without permission.\nNot only the outskirts of Dhaka but all the last remaining cropland, wetland, forestland, ponds, rivers in any direction about 100 kilometres off the capital centre have been changing into housing schemes fast.\nThe laws have turned into a mockery as the government agencies themselves neither comply with nor enforce those.\nThe Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) itself fills up land for housing projects or approves private housing projects in the areas, which are supposed to be preserved as flood flow zone.\nThe present trend of losing agricultural land and other open spaces was very alarming, said Shamshul Huda, coordinator of Association for Land Reform and Development (ALRD). \"The government should enforce the laws very strictly to stop this practice,\" he said.\nThe ALRD has conducted a study which shows every year 72,077 acres of agro-land is being converted to non-agricultural land with 90 percent of it being used for housing."

      "text": " Modhumoti Model Town in Amin Bazar on the outskirts of the capital. The town was built by filling up a wetland and the Supreme Court yesterday ordered the real-estate company to restore the wetland and repay, in double, people who bought plots from it. Photo: File The Supreme Court has directed Metro Makers and Developers Ltd to restore within six months the wetlands of Savar where it implemented illegal housing scheme Modhumoti Model Town.\nIn case of MMDL's failure to comply with the order, the court asked the Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) to take up the work at the company's expense.\nMMDL has also been directed to refund its customer double the money it had charged for each plot of land, including the registration cost, in six months.\nThe Appellate Division of the SC in the verdict also ruled that a family or a body cannot acquire more than 100 bighas of land as per President's Orders No-98 of 1972.\nThe apex court released the full text of the 159-page verdict yesterday, 11 months after it had declared in the short verdict MMDL's project in Bilamalia and Bailarpur mouzas illegal.\nThe company had developed the housing project filling in 550 acres of wetlands identified as floodplain in the 1997 Dhaka City Master Plan.\nOn August 7 last year, the SC came up with the short verdict after hearing five separate appeals filed in 2009 challenging different portions of a 2005 High Court verdict.\nOf the appeals, MMDL filed two while its land purchasers, Rajuk and Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela) each filed one.\nOn July 27, 2005, the HC declared the Modhumoti Model Town project \"unauthorised, illegal and against public interest\". The court had also directed authorities to protect the interest of around 3,500 plot purchasers, but it did not say how.\nIn the full text of the verdict, the SC said the fundamental rights of third party (plot) purchasers cannot override the fundamental rights of overwhelming number of residents of the metropolis under the constitution of the republic.\n\"Though the third party purchasers may not be treated as bona fide, yet it is a fact that they have been roped in by Metro Makers by misrepresentation that permission for the development work had been obtained from Rajuk and justice demands that they should be compensated,\" said the verdict.\nIt also observed, \"If these lands are filled up it will cause serious problem in draining out water resulting from flood and rain and the affected people can compel the authorities through judicial review to take steps to preserve and protect health, environment and ecology in the Metropolitan areas.\"\nBela Chief Executive Syeda Rizwana Hasan told The Daily Star that the SC verdict would help the government stop illegal activities of the housing companies, including encroaching on and filling in low lands, and save the environment.\nAlthough it was posted on the website, MMDL's lawyer ABM Siddiqur Rahman Khan said he was not aware of the full text of the SC verdict."

Vehicles, including passenger buses, remained stranded on both sides of all the four ferry terminals.\nLocal administration sources said at least 40 char villages in Galachipa 20 villages in Dasmina, 15 villages in Kalapara, 10 villages each in Baufal and Mirzaganj, five villages in Dumki and two villages in Sadar upazila have been flooded with tidal water.  Flood water submerges a house and a cowshed at Tonga village in Zianagar upazila of Pirojpur yesterday. Tidal surge under the impact of full moon inundated several hundred villages in 12 upazilas of Patuakhali and Pirojpur districts on the day. Photo: Star Many areas in Kalapara, Galachipa and Mirzaganj upazila towns have also gone under water. Downpour also paralysed normal life in the coastal district.\nIn Pirojpur, villages beside Baleshar, Kacha and Sandha rivers in four upazilas of the district have been submerged by tidal surge yesterday.\nWater entered the villages under Zianagar, Mathbaria, Bhandaria and Kawkhali upazilas in the afternoon, marooning thousands of people, according to our correspondent.\nThe gangway of Togra ferry terminal had gone under. Passengers were seen crossing the way, wading through knee-deep water.\nTube-wells at the flood-hit village have also been submerged. Civil Surgeon (CS) Md Abdul Goni said if flood water remains stagnant for 2-3 more days, water-borne diseases like diarrhea may spread in the affected areas.\nFishes from thousands of ponds and enclosures have been washed away. Some fish cultivators were seen erecting boundaries with nets around their enclosures.\nOur Bagerhat correspondent adds: Tidal surge under the impact of full moon yesterday flooded many areas of Bagerhat town, BSCIC industrial estate and Mongla municipality.\nWater entered the areas, overflowing the Bhairab River embankment near the district town at noon. At least 100 Christian families at Maria Palli adjacent to the river have been marooned.\nAs the water level in the river has marked a sharp rise, the embankment of the Water Development Board (WDB) in four upazilas of the district is also under threat."

      "text": " One does not have to look too far back to find that in the olden days men were usually seen sporting a grey-black suit or adorning a stark white panjabi in case of festivities. The array of colours that men ventured into was minimal and tended to range in a very narrow spectrum. But things have changed now; men are broadening their spectrum and are opting for bolder colours running a wild gamut from baby pink to magenta, from electric blue to violet. You name it; men are not scared to try out the bold and vibrant colours any more.\nAnd to bring on this change and provide for a growing clientele many boutiques have established themselves in the suburbs of Dhaka city. One such store is Chondon, which started its journey in the home of Chondona Dewan herself, but due to increasing demands had to be moved to a store in Gulshan in 2002 where it has established its firm roots.\nAlong with being an entrepreneur, Chondona Dewan is also active in social causes and has participated in the charity fashion show in assistance of the flood victims in the devastating flood of 2004. As a promoter of women's empowerment, she feels extremely proud to have women working with her, both in Dhaka and at her village home in Rangpur.  \"We try to cater to anyone with a taste and choice for something different, and we have been blessed with a versatile clientele. Our outfits have been endorsed and admired by many friends and customers from the media, films, fashion and the corporate world, locally and internationally\" says Dewan.\nTheir signature style is very ethnic but also trendy and very wearable. The collection uses lots of coloured patches embellished with sequins, zari, mirror, beads, baubles, etc. on shalwar suits, fatuas, saris, blouses and shawls which transforms them from everyday mundane to extraordinary. The use of cotton and silk, blended with crepe, georgette, chiffon, soft tissue and brocade are seen to work together in creating a timeless as well as trendy line of outfits.\nWhen asked about her inspiration, Chondona Dewan says that she is inspired by the world around her, the people, changing seasons, colours, and also talking to her clients who provide her with valuable insight.\nChondon's new panjabi collection has been created keeping in mind the festivities of Eid as well as the summer season. The fabrics used are mainly handloom, cotton, endi and silk. The panjabis are also adorned with embroidery, zardousi, screen print, block print and come in solid colours with a variety of necklines.\nThe colours are bright and they pop out so there is no chance of being blanketed in the crowd. The bright, sunny colours have been used as many festivities are coming up ahead and this had managed to enhance the collection further. Softer and lighter shades of colour are also available to help combat the heat as well as look fashionable.\nChondon aims to cater to the likes of its versatile patrons who want to look fashionable and feel comfortable at the same time. Prices start from Tk.1800. So this summer be bold and be fashionable because 'Chondon' has designs that promise to liven up your Eid and the sultry summer days that lie ahead.

      "text": " A layer of salt has covered this dried up canal in Pakhimara village of Kalapara, Patuakhali - a mark of salinity intrusion in the coastal belt. The photo was taken in the first week of May. Photo: Arif Rahoman As fresh water flow has tapered off on the upper stream of rivers over the last four decades, due to human intervention mainly in neighbouring India, salinity has intruded into 100 rivers and affected 15 percent of the country's total cropland in the south-western coastal districts.\nThis was revealed in a study, Soil Salinity Map, by Soil Resource and Development Institute (SRDI) based on data from 2009.\nThe coastal region had always been saline naturally and now it has become even worse. Back in 1973, as much as 0.83 million hectares of land was saline. The area has now increased to 1.05 million hectares in 93 upazilas, which makes up more than half the coastal land mass in the Ganges floodplain.\nSalinity, said the study, has put the health, livelihood and food security of millions of people in 18 coastal districts in jeopardy.\nExperts faulted the death of the Garai due to periodic stoppage of water supply by India's Farakka barrage for decades, leading to receding groundwater level, extensive shrimp farming and sea level rise triggered by global warming.Records of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) show that the water level of the Passur river has increased by 5.6 mm between 1977 and 2009 at Hiron Point of the Sundarbans. Experts attributed this rise to an intrusion by salt water, weakening the flow of fresh water.\nThe salt water was gradually intruding into the rivers and affecting over 6,200 hectares of farmland (equivalent to 7,140 football fields) on an average annually, the study found.\nPublished last year, the salinity map was prepared after analysing 2,500 soil and water samples, collected in April-May, 2009 from the entire coast of the country stretching 720 kilometres.\nWater in all the rivers in the country's southwest (in the Ganges flood plain) was extremely saline. The salt water had intruded over 100-km on the Madhumati river in Gopalganj during the summer and it was advancing at a rate of one kilometre a year, pointed out the report.\nThe salinity level in some areas was as high as 25 ppt (means 25 grams of salt dissolved in one kg of soil or water) where probably no crops will grow throughout the year. At some other points, the salinity was moderate and mild.\n\"The situation in Satkhira is the worst as the mouths of the two distributaries of the Ganges -- the Mathabhanga and the Jalangi -- have been totally filled up and Satkhira doesn't get any fresh water supply from upstream basins,\" leading hydrologist Prof Ainun Nishat told The Daily Star.\n\"Salinity in other districts would reduce if the government builds a barrage across the Ganges and supplies fresh water to the Garai and Madhumati. But I don't see any hope for Satkhira,\" he added.\nTo prevent salinity, the government had dredged some silted rivers, including the Garai, Kabadak, and Mukteshawari, in the south-western region. But it did not help improve the situation due to lack of fresh water flow in these rivers which could carry the sediments and push back the sea water.\nShrimp cultivation has become very popular in the area since the 1960s. Flooding with high saline water in the area every year was causing higher soil salinity, mentioned the report.\nExperts also blamed depletion in groundwater level for the expansion of salinity problem.\n\"If the groundwater level drops, water from the sea intrudes on the groundwater system, which is happening in the southern districts,\" said Iftekharul Islam, a groundwater expert now working as national consultant (environmental safeguard) at the agriculture ministry.\nRegarding the study, Khorshed Alam of SRDI said, \"The soil and water samples were collected before cyclone Aila hit the area. We believe the salinity level has increased further in the mean time. So we plan to make a new map to help farmers choose suitable crops considering the level of salinity.\"\nDEATH OF GARAI\nThe death of the Garai river system is one of the major reasons for salinity in the region.\nSince the Farakka Barrage was launched in 1973 on the Ganges river, India had shut down all the sluice gates of the barrage in September to retain water for its irrigation for several months. Across the border, as there had been no water flow for several months, silt filled up the river Garai at the confluence of the Padma near Kushtia over the years.\nConsequently, the Garai became totally disconnected from the Padma and was unable to pump in fresh water to the south-western districts down below.\nAfter India and Bangladesh reached the Ganges treaty in 1996, India started supplying minimum of 27,400 cusec of water in the dry season. By then, the Garai became so disconnected that this water could not feed the Garai-Madhumati-Pashur river system.\n\"The Garai river, which used to supply fresh water to a large portion of the southern districts and the Sundarbans, is absolutely dead now due to the Farakka barrage,\" said eminent hydrologist M Inamul Haque.\nDredging the Garai mouth would not help much due to extensive siltation, he added.\nBut if the Ganges barrage is built to retain water during the rainy season, it could ensure water flow through the Garai-Madhumati and thereby reduce the salinity level in the Khulna-Jessore area, suggested experts.\nDuring the lean period, the country used to get 4,000 cusecs of water daily before the Farakka was built. The amount now has declined to around 2,700 cusecs."

      "text": "The Louhajang river in Tangail is in a sorry state these days, thanks to mindless encroachment on both sides of the watercourse.   \nWhile visiting the river recently, this correspondent found concrete structures built on both sides of the river at Akur Takur Para, West Akur Takur Para, Kagmara, Stadium Area, Dhulerchar, Beradoma, Dighulia, Kagmari and Mirer Betka in the municipality.\nThe illegal structures have clogged the river in such a way that one bank is just a stone's throw from another.\nGoing down the memory lane, some senior citizens in the town have said goods-laden boats used to ply and anchor here even three decades ago.\nA road at College Para in the town was named as 'Amghat', as mangoes from Rajshahi were unloaded there, they added.\nThey blamed the construction of a sluice gate on the river in 1992 that left it in dire straits.\nThe Water Development Board under its Flood Action Plan-20 built the gate near the confluence of the Louhajang and Dhaleswari rivers.\nOriginating from the Dhaleswari river at Baisnabbari in Sadar upazila, the 35-km long Louhajang flows through Tangail town and falls into the Bangshai at Jamurki in Mirzapur upazila. The sluice gate dealt a blow to the river's navigability, which in turn encouraged grabbers to encroach on the river in succeeding years in the absence of a much-needed water flow, locals added.   \nAbdur Rashid, sub-divisional engineer of the WDB in Tangail, said the river was at least 150 feet wide even a decade ago. He said the breadth of the river has shrunk by 60 feet.  \nEnvironment activist Masudur Rahman Rana said appeals to revive the river by local groups had gone unheeded.  \nShahidur Rahman Khan Mukti, mayor of Tangail municipality, said, \"We have been constructing a 5-km walkway on the bank of the river in the municipal area under a project funded by the WDB. The initiative will save the river from being encroached upon.\" He, however, said the construction works had been stalled due to a funds crunch.\nAnisur Rahman Miah, Deputy Commissioner of Tangail, said he had advised the municipal authorities to construct walkways on both sides of the river.\nThe administration had been working on a list of grabbers and structures, he said.\nThe DC, however, added that the whole process would take six months to complete.

Thirty nine years after the murder of the Father of the Nation, and the members of his family, Syed Badrul Ahsan makes note of some of the books that have been written about Bangabandhu since 1975. Here is a sample of the vast literature which has grown up around the historical personality of Bangladesh's founding father. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib\nKoekti Oitihashik Dolil\nAbdul Matin\nRadical Asia Publications\nAbdul Matin, who died a few years ago, had been researching Bangabandhu's life and politics since the early 1970s. In this work, he draws extensively from documents previously in the hands of foreign governments, notably the United States, to explain the circumstances that led to the assassinations of August 1975. There are too some rich pickings from Keesing's, those that will be of immense help to anyone interested in studying the history of Bangladesh. It is especially the conspiracy that led to the killing of the Father of the Nation that arouses his interest. Included in the work under survey are some hard truths, those that political authors have sometimes pointed out. Among them are details pertaining to the letter purportedly written by the leftwing Bengali politician Abdul Haq to Pakistan's prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto seeking assistance in the matter of pushing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's government from office. Sheikh Mujib\nTriumph and Tragedy\nS.A. Karim\nThe University Press Limited\nThe work happens to be one of those rare studies in the English language of Bangladesh's founding father. For years there has been a vacuum where presenting Bangabandhu to the outside world is concerned (not that much headway has been made in the matter). So what S.A. Karim, who served as a leading Bengali diplomat in the early years of a free Bangladesh and who saw many of the dramatic events unfold before his very eyes, does here is present an image of Bangabandhu and his leadership of the country in as realistic a manner as possible. The writer does not shy away from criticism of Mujib he feels is deserving. Mujib's role in the movement for regional autonomy and his leadership of the independence movement are commented on in great detail. And then Karim dwells on the issue of why Mujib went for a change from multi-party democracy to one-party rule in early 1975. In the manner of so many others, the author does not appreciate the transformation and ends up giving the impression that Baksal was a bad move for which Bangabandhu paid dearly. Shorone Bangabandhu\nFaruq Choudhury\nMawla Brothers\nThe former diplomat is in awe of Bangabandhu. In this slim volume, he reflects on the politics of the Father of the Nation and, more importantly, on the human qualities of the man. The language is simple and lucid and Choudhury properly gives out the impression that he is hugely impressed by the charisma of the leader.\nFaruq Chowdhury's work does not go into the intricate details of how Bangabandhu governed or how his government functioned. But that the government was confronted with a plethora of difficulties from day one to the end of Bangabandhu's life is made clear. And, of course, the vast conspiracy that was always at work in order to destabilize the government is broadly hinted at. Sheikh Mujib\nBangladesher Arek Naam\nAtiur Rahman\nDipti Prokashoni\nThe work promises much to those who plan to research the evolution of East Pakistan into Bangladesh. The life of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, so Atiur Rahman conveys the impression and justifiably too, is fundamentally the history of Bangladesh, of the struggles its people have carried on through generations.\nThe author does a marvellous job of bringing together all the significant events of Bangabandhu's political career. But surely the beauty of the work lies in the detailed, chronological presentation of facts he engages in. It is thus that the Six Points, Eleven Points, Declaration of Independence, et cetera, come to readers in a form that enable them to understand the movement of history in this part of the world.  On balance, it is a useful work, not to be ignored. Shotrur Chokhe Bangabandhu\nDr. Mohammad Hannan\nAnupam Prakashani\nA work that is rather different from the usual assessments that are made of the Father of the Nation and his politics. Mohammad Hannan focuses on the views people not kindly disposed toward Bangabandhu happen to express about him. In a way, one could say, the author is coming forth with the other side of the picture, that which Mujib's opponents have drawn up of his politics.You may not be convinced by what Bangabandhu's detractors have to say about the Bengali leader here. But it is worth a try reading the  book. The book is, once again, quite a departure from works which usually flood the markets. Try reading it. You might end up liking it. Bangabandhu\nRajniti O Proshashon\nBangabandhu Parishad\nBangabandhu Parishad has been an intellectual forum for the Awami League or, more appropriately, its followers. As such, this work is in its totality a collection of essays from a wide range of individuals on the diverse aspects of Bangabandhu's politics and administration. Obviously, the write-ups are appreciative of Mujib's positions on the various issues he faced. You may not agree with everything, but you surely will get the drift of what the Father of the Nation tried to achieve during the brief three and a half years he was in power. Ekatturer Muktijuddho Roktakto\nModdho August O Shorhojontrer November\nCol. (retd) Shafayat Jamil\n(with Shumon Kaiser)\nShahitya Prokash\nShafayat Jamil was a key player in the dramatic events that were to unfold in November 1975. As part of the team led by Khaled Musharraf to reclaim the state from the predators who had commandeered it barely three months earlier, he was instrumental in forcing Khondokar Moshtaq to resign and the killers of Bangabandhu and the four national leaders to quit Bangabhavan. The book deals with three historical aspects. There is the history, in however brief a fashion, of the war of liberation. That is followed by a comprehensive discussion of the tragedy of August 1975. And then, of course, comes an explication of the incidents and events leading from 3 November to 7 November 1975. Jamil is a survivor, a fortunate one. All the other leading figures of the Musharraf-led coup perished in the counter-coup spearheaded by Colonel Abu Taher. Ziaur Rahman emerged as the eventual beneficiary, with such disastrous results. Father of the Nation\nBangabandhu Memorial Trust\nAn admirable album of photographs and images of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, beginning with his schooldays and ending with the end of his life in August 1975. The pictures are interspersed with quotes from the Father of the Nation, all expressive of his thoughts regarding the course Bangladesh should be taking on its journey to the future. Copies just might yet be had at Bangabandhu Memorial Museum on Dhanmondi 32, the spot that is today part of Bangladesh's history --- of its glories, of its dark tragedies. Ekatturer 26 March\nBangabandhur Shadhinota Ghoshona\nMohammad Shahjahan\nBangla Prokashoni\nMohammad Shahjahan's focus, as the title of the book makes clear, is on the events surrounding the declaration of independence in March 1971. With various quarters trying to stir up controversy over what actually happened on 26 March and especially with the rightwing attempting to build up Ziaur Rahman as the man who formally announced the country's independence, the author presents the facts he thinks settle the issue once and for all. Shahjahan comes forth with documents, with news reports of the period in question and thus adds substance to his assertion that Bangabandhu did indeed send out the message of freedom to the country before he was taken into custody by the Pakistan army in the early hours of 26 March 1971. Geneva-e Bangabandhu\nAbdul Matin\nRadical Asia Publications\nOnce again it is Abdul Matin, this time with an account of Bangabandhu's stay in Geneva following surgery in London in mid 1972. The Father of the Nation was in a state of convalescence in Switzerland, but that did not deter him from meeting any and every Bengali who came calling on him. Matin provides a fascinating account of all the men and matters that came to Bangabandhu's attention during that time --- the genuine ones, the insidious ones and the plain hangers on. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman\nSharokgrantha\nJyotsna Publishers\nThis is a rich collection of articles on the life and achievements of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. It comes in three volumes and brings together a rich assortment of ideas from diverse personalities, all of whom are united by a common position on the 1971 war of liberation and the ideals set by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through the 1960s and 1970s. The volumes testify to the many facets of the Mujib character, those that have always made him stand out in the crowd and stand apart from his contemporaries. You really must appreciate the endeavour of those behind the compilations. Bangladesh\nThe Unfinished Revolution\nLawrence Lifschultz\nZed Press\nThe work comes in two segments. Lifschultz dwells at considerable length on Colonel Abu Taher and his ultimate end on the gallows in one. In the other, his subject is the personality and government of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the difficulties it came up against and the conspiracies which proved to be its undoing. Lifschultz writes with considerable bravery, which is again natural considering his status as a foreigner. He focuses on a number of salient points about the coup of August 1975 and while doing so points the finger at foreign governments he suspects clearly knew, if they did not exactly take part, in the programme to eliminate Bangladesh's founder. The Trial of Henry Kissinger\nChristopher Hitchens\nVerso\nThis surely is an acclaimed book, not least because Hitchens made a reputation for himself as a plain-speaking writer. The work is divided into several chapters, the better to explain the nature of Henry Kissinger's sinister policies in places as diverse as Chile and Bangladesh. Where the matter is one of Bangabandhu's assassination, Hitchens leaves little doubt that the American establishment knew all about it before it happened. He comes down hard on then US ambassador to Bangladesh, Davis Eugene Boster (he misspells the name as Booster).The bigger significance of the work is the author's focus on Kissinger's deep hatred for Bangladesh, a nation that had the audacity to break away from the American client state of Pakistan. Kissinger snubbed Mujib in Washington by not being present at the White House meeting between the Bengali leader and President Ford, but a short while later he sought to make amends, by visiting Dhaka and calling on Bangabandhu.\nIt is a revealing book, a collector's item.Ponchattorer Roktokhoron\nMajor Rafiqul Islam psc\nAfsar Brothers\nRafiqul Islam's book traces the entire history of the conspiracy that lay at the root of what happened on 15 August 1975. He names names and is often surprised that the very men who worked diligently for Pakistan in the days of rising Bengali nationalism or even after Bangladesh declared its independence in late March 1971 were chosen by Bangabandhu to be near him, and literally at that.It was these very men who destroyed the Father of the Nation. Who Killed Mujib?\nA.L. Khatib\nVikas Publishing House\nOne of the earliest books on the tragedy of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (the work was published in 1981), it explores the wide network of conspiracy that was to take the life of the Father of the Nation in 1975. A.L. Khatib, a prominent journalist with roots in Sri Lanka but based for the better part of his career in the South Asian subcontinent, brings out some intricate details of the plans shaped to do away with Bangabandhu. The criticism is there that the book was written in haste. Perhaps, but what certainly is of importance is that there is hardly any instance Khatib cites about the tragedy that one can be dismissive of. A whole range of characters people the book. Apart from Bangabandhu, there are all the other characters, notably the 'little sparrow of a man' that was Khondokar Moshtaq as also the political figures who constantly used to be around Mujib but at dawn on 15 August were found in the usurper's company. From Rebel to Founding Father\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman\nSyed Badrul Ahsan\n  Niyogi Books, New Delhi\nThe work is a recent assessment of the life and achievements of the Father of the Nation, beginning with his foray into student politics in pre-partition Calcutta and ending with his assassination in Dhaka. In the process, the writer touches on the philosophy that worked in Bangabandhu's gradual rise to pre-eminence in Bengali politics. Emphasis has also been placed on some of the crucial, and fateful, moves he made in post-Liberation Bangladesh, especially the growing rift between him and his steadfast lieutenant Tajuddin Ahmad. Distant Neighbours\nA Tale of the Subcontinent\nKuldip Nayar\nA book published in the early 1970s, months after the emergence of Bangladesh, it is essentially a series of interviews the veteran Indian journalist conducted with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in Dhaka and Islamabad. The theme focuses on the interaction between the two men in the aftermath of Bangladesh's liberation in December 1971, when Bangabandhu was first placed under house arrest in Rawalpindi by his nemesis and then freed to return to a free Bangladesh. Nayar's conclusion is revealing: he finds Mujib's account of the talks to be truthful while Bhutto simply dissembles. The work is an interesting character study of the two men who played significant roles in the history of the subcontinent in 1971."

Those facing life imprisonment include the chief executive of Soma Mining, Can Gurkan, who is also the son of the company's owner.\nAn explosion followed by the collapse of a mine at Soma in the west of the country killed the 301 miners in Turkey's worst-ever industrial accident. Most were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning.\nExpert reports pointed to several safety violations at the mine, including a shortage of carbon monoxide detectors, ceilings made of wood instead of metal, and a lack of high-quality gas masks.\nSoma Mining has denied any responsibility.\nThe disaster sparked a wave of fury against then prime minister -- now President -- Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was accused of indifference to the plight of the victims.\nIt also reignited concerns over lax safety in a country with the highest rate of workplace fatalities in Europe, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO).\nFollowing the disaster, the government introduced a new action plan to improve safety in the country's mines.\nBut in the latest accident to hit the country's disaster-prone mining industry, a flood at a mine in the southern Karaman region left 18 miners trapped last week.\nThe government has yet to confirm their deaths, but hopes are next to zero of finding anyone alive with the miners remaining under tonnes of water."

The decision was taken at a meeting of the Business Advisory Committee at the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban yesterday. Suranjit Sengupta, chief of the parliamentary standing committee on the law ministry, confirmed it to The Daily Star. Earlier on August 18, the cabinet approved the proposal for restoration of parliament's authority to impeach Supreme Court judges. According to the draft law, parliament could impeach an SC judge on grounds of misconduct or incapacity by passing a resolution with at least a two-thirds majority. The president will then issue an order to this effect. At the Business Advisory Committee meeting, it was also decided that the third session of the 10th parliament, which began yesterday, would continue till September 18. The meeting, chaired by Speaker Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, was attended among others by Leader of the House and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Leader of the Opposition Raushan Ershad. The JS on its first day in the third session yesterday adopted obituary references on the death of 17 noted personalities, including former lawmakers and journalists. After the question-answer session, Raushan Ershad took the floor and urged the government to form separate commissions to discuss the two bills on the national broadcast policy and the constitutional amendment that would give back parliament the power to impeach Supreme Court judges. \"Only discussions can resolve everything and thus the government should form committees in consultation with all stakeholders and the common people to avert controversy,\" she said. The opposition leader expressed her concern over deteriorating law and order situation in the country mentioning recent killing of Islamic Front leader Sheikh Nurul Islam Faruqi and Moghbazar's triple murder. \"Home is the safest place for a person and if he is killed in his own house, then where will he go?\" she raised the question and called upon the government to ensure rule of law by bringing the culprits to book. Raushan also asked the government to distribute adequate relief materials among the flood-affected people."

      "text": "The problem of waterlogging in Chittagong has reached such an extent that the first monsoon rain is enough to shut down the city. The most vulnerable places are Bakalia, Chawkbazar, Agrabad, Halishahar, Kapasgola, Chandgaon, Shulakbahar, Bahaddarhat and the Probartak intersection, which went under water due to heavy rains, causing immense sufferings to the people living in these areas.  Chittagong is located in the tropical zone, where high temperature and heavy rainfall with high humidity is a general characteristic of the summer season. Annual rainfall in the city fluctuates between 2100mm and 3800mm, of which 2400mm occurs only during the monsoon. However, such climate has been there for centuries, while water logging is a comparatively recent phenomenon. In the last decade or so, this problem has been increasing due to population growth, economic agglomeration with unplanned urbanisation, illegal refilling of natural water channels, and encroachment of drains.  Most of the drainages are obstructed by building structures, that have overtaken the natural gravitational drainage systems of the city, which were organised enough to cope with the natural rainfall.  The causes behind waterlogging are well known and the media have been vocal on these issues. Despite that, why is there little policy intervention to improve the situation? First of all, the governance of drainage systems does not belong to any particular authority. Besides, the distribution of management of the drainage system follows the drainage hierarchy, namely the primary, secondary and tertiary drainage. The Chittagong City Corporation (CCC), for example, mainly deals with the drainages besides houses, roads and small scale, unstructured rainwater runoffs. While the Chittagong Development Authority (CDA) deals with primary and larger canals, Chittagong WASA (CWASA) is responsible for sanitation and storm water management. Hence, drainage system management is either over-mandated or under-mandated to these institutions.  Some critics allege that coordination meetings among stakeholders are held only during the monsoon when the water logging issue surfaces. Recently, the CCC and CDA were given the responsibility to reclaim the Chaktai khal (canals) at a coordination meeting. However, past  experiences show that the decisions made in such meetings are barely implemented. After developing the CMMP 1995 guideline, the drainage system was supposed to be implemented within one and a half years but the plan has not been put into effect in the last 13 years. Lack of coordination also hindered the construction work of the canal (Mirza- Chaktai), which could have protected a huge area under Panchlaish and Chandgaon Police Station from waterlogging (The Daily Star, 2008). Several authoritative bodies are responsible for managing the drainage system of the city. The core responsibility for storm water drainage and sewerage belongs to CWASA. However, CWASA has neither developed any sewerage system nor storm water drainage infrastructure till date. CCC is mainly working on the local and tertiary drainage development and construction and is also responsible to keep the drains clean. CDA's role is to incorporate drains in land-use and structural plans and allot space in city designs. The Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), another statutory body, is responsible to plan the flood management of CCC and they are both involved in linking embankment with the drainage system.  Budget constraints add to the problem of proper drainage. The Chittagong Storm Water Drainage and Flood Control Master Plan 1995 proposed for developing the drainage system in five phases within the plan period of 1995-2015. Regrettably, eight years have passed since the gazette publication of the Drainage Master Plan in 1999 with no visible progress in its implementation. No progress is noticed in the reclamation of the Chaktai canal, the backbone of drainage system of the port city, either.  Moreover, one of the biggest challenges for CCC in managing the drainage system is to deal with the illegal occupation of the canals. Many of the primary canals have disappeared and several secondary canals are either completely or partially occupied. The occupiers are very powerful and no government authority wants to recover any of them. It was only during the period of the caretaker government in 2007-08 that the CCC managed to recover the Chaktai khal. The CDA and CCC are now planning to excavate new canals instead of reclaiming the old ones.  The blueprint of the city is the main source of the problems, as the management of waterlogging issue was not planned accordingly in the city's design. In 1961 the first master plan was devised, with the main focus being on zoning maps for housing and industries and very little or no reference to drainage planning (CMMP-4 1995). Since then, major drainage planning has been devised without any integration with the planning process of land use. As a result, engineers built drains, rehabilitated canals on an ad hoc basis. The future use of flood plains was not considered in the provisions for flood storage works. Building of flood plains is allowed without providing for the appropriate drainage that is 20 feet or 60 feet long. However, the drain width mysteriously remained constant at 2 to 3 feet.   There is also a lack of coordination in the entire drainage management. There has to be one central authority under which CDA, WASA and other bodies can work together, towards the same goal. Such mechanisms can only be implemented with collective, coordinated efforts under a city government arrangement.

Georgia's Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili has called on residents to stay indoors until the animals have been found. Some have been recaptured or killed though it is unclear how many are missing. Helicopters are now circling the city as part of a search and rescue operation. Tbilisi's vice-mayor, Irakly Lekvinadze, estimated the preliminary damage at $10m (PS6.43m). In May 2012, five people were killed in Tbilisi after another river flooded."

The flood control embankment on the river got damaged at four points last year, causing saline water to enter Charipara, Dhanjupara, Banatipara, Poshurbunia, Chowdhurypara, Munshipara, Nayakata, Nawapara, Majher Howla and Boropachnon villages in Kalapara upazila, especially during the full moon and new moon. The situation remains tolerable during the dry season from November to mid-April but flooding by saline water turns serious in other times of the year, locals said.  \"For the last four days, tidal surges have continued entering the villages through four damaged points of the flood control embankment. Agricultural lands, village roads, ponds, and in some cases houses have gone under water,\" said Md Tariqul Islam, a local resident. Haesa Begum, 45, a housewife of Charipara village, said they have to wait for water to recede during the low tide to start cooking.Local people are also facing crisis of drinking water.  Salinity hampers farming while cattle are facing fodder shortage as grazing land also went under water, said Abul Kalam, a local farmer.Presence of students is now thin as roads have gone under water, said Abdul Aziz, assistant teacher for Charipara Government Primary School. Thousands of people of these villagers formed a human chain in the upazila town demanding repair of the damaged embankment last year but the authorities concerned did not take any step in this regard, said Mir Tariquzzaman Tara, chairman for Lalua union parishad.\"Salinity due to entrance of tidal water through these damaged parts badly affects the agriculture. We sent letters several times to Water Development Board (WDB) to take necessary step to repair the embankment but in vain,\" he said. Md Shahidul Islam, executive engineer of WDB in Kalapara, said they sent letters to the higher authorities seeking fund allocation to repair the embankment but no allocation has been made yet."

While still in his teens, Ghatak and his family moved to Kolkata, just before the devastating famine of 1943 and the partition of 1947 when millions migrated from the erstwhile East Bengal to the West. This flood of refugees, the cultural dismemberment and exile shaped the volume of the creative works of the director and screenwriter. After moving to Kolkata, Ritwik Ghatak wrote his first stage play \"Kalo Sayar\" in 1948, and continued to work for the Indian People's Theatre Association till the 1970s, where he wrote, translated, directed and acted in numerous plays. His first venture in films was as an actor and assistant director in \"Chhinnamul\" in 1950, followed by his first own directorial work \"Nagorik\" in 1952. Ghatak's first commercial release was \"Ajantrik\" in 1958, a breakthrough comedy-drama with science fiction themes. Ritwik Ghatak remained stagnant as a filmmaker through the later part of the 1960s after his epic trilogy of \"Meghe Dhaka Tara\" (1960), \"Komal Gandhar\" (1961) and \"Subarnarekha\" (1962) -- based in Kolkata and addressing the condition of refugee-hood -- proved controversial, and commercially unsuccessful. He returned to filmmaking in the 1970s, with \"Titash Ekti Nodir Naam\" in Bangladesh and the autobiographical \"Jukti Takko Aar Gappo\". Ghwatak moved briefly to Pune to teach at the Film and Television Institute of India, and in a year of teaching left a league of students who would carry his ideals forward. He kept a clear distance from Indian commercial films, and as a result, remained an unknown name outside India until his death. \"Nagarik\", despite being one of the first instances of Bangla art films, was not released until after his death in 1977. His film \"Bari Theke Paliye\" (1958) had a similar plot to Francois Truffaut later film \"The 400 Blows\" (1959), but Ghatak's film remained obscure while Truffaut's film went on to become one of the most famous films of the French New Wave. One of Ghatak's final films, \"Titash Ekti Nodir Naam\", is one of the earliest films to be told in a hyperlink format, featuring multiple characters in a collection of interconnected stories, predating Robert Altman's \"Nashville\", globally considered a pioneer of the style, by two years. His poor health forced him to leave many short and feature films incomplete. He passed away on February 6, 1976."

New lawmakers, who have not got housing plots in the capital yet, lobbied  with the public works minister, who then directed Rajuk, he said. Rajuk organised the programme to inform of the role it played in the last one year. Rajuk board members, among others, were present. Rajuk has miserably faltered on its foremost duty of ensuring a planned capital city with development control, said Salma A Shafi, a researcher on housing and land at the Centre for Urban Studies. This is due to a conflict of interest, as while being a planning regulator, it is simultaneously a land developer involved in housing projects, she said. Mid last year, Housing and Public Works Minister Mosharraf Hossain at a public meeting in the capital said the government would not take up any more housing projects with Rajuk. His predecessor, Abdul Mannan Khan, too made a similar public declaration in mid-2012. So far, Rajuk developed a number of housing schemes like the Uttara model town, Purbachal New Town and Jheelmil Residential Area with a limited number of plots. After three years' delay, it has resumed constructing 79 buildings containing 6,600 flats in Uttara Third Phase. Apart from plots, Purbachal will have 60,000 flats while Jheelmil 10,000.   The Rajuk chairman was asked why they have not reclaimed, keeping with the Detailed Area Plan (DAP) and a High Court order, conservable flood flow zones and low-lying water retention areas which have been filled with earth by illegal real estate developers. \"The court order is rational but its execution is difficult,\" he replied. He was also asked why they amended DAP to legalise illegal housing businesses in and around the capital and why they have not stopped rampant illegal commercialisation of residential neighbourhoods like Gulshan, Dhanmondi, Banani, Baridhara and Uttara. Jainal Abedin just said, \"We and the minister are firm about it.\" Innumerable buildings have been constructed in violation of the approved plan in the five areas, he said, adding that they now have a 1,980-strong manpower in place of the previous 1,080 and hoped to perform better."

      "text": "A hydroponics system in Bangladesh, based on floating gardens, has been recognised by the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) for innovation, sustainability, and adaptability. Farmers in some parts of the country where flood waters can remain for a prolonged period of time have developed floating gardens in which plants can be grown on the water on floating organic beds of water hyacinth, algae and other plant residues. This environmentally friendly traditional cultivation technique utilises the natural resources of wetlands to grow vegetables and other crops almost all year round, providing numerous social, economic, agricultural, and ecological benefits to the local population. Bangladesh's floating gardens along with a trio of sites in Japan -- sustainable river fisheries in Gifu, apricot farming on nutrient-poor slopes in Wakayama, and mountainous agriculture and forestry system in Miyazaki -- got the official recognition during a joint meeting of the GIAHS Steering and Scientific Committee at the FAO headquarters in Rome last week.  The new designations take the number of GIAHS to 36 sites, located across 15 countries in Africa, Latin America, Near East and Asia. FAO Deputy Director-General Maria Helena Semedo said on Tuesday, \"In the context of today's environmental and economic challenges and climate change, small-scale and family farmers, and especially traditional agriculture, can offer real solutions for food security, the conservation of natural resources and sustainable rural development, if adequate policies and investment are directed to them.\" GIAHS was launched by FAO in 2002, and has been recently endorsed by member countries.   3 Japanese GIAHS Ayu of the Nagara River System in Gifu Nagara is one of the cleanest rivers in Japan that provides a number of ecosystem services. Various components of the system such as rivers, forests and farmlands are closely linked to each other. The sustainable inland fisheries of a specific type of fish (Ayu) benefit from clean waters of the Nagara River which are maintained through upstream forest management. Local communities have lived within this linked ecosystem and have developed their livelihoods and cultural practices.   Minabe-Tanabe Ume System in Wakayama Minabe-Tanabe Ume System allows for the production of high-quality Ume (Japanese apricots) and various kinds of fruits on nutrient-poor slopes. Local communities have created a thriving Ume fruit production environment by maintaining upper coppice forests for landslide prevention and maintenance of water, and Japanese honeybee for pollinators. By permitting the production of a diverse range of products, the system ensures stable livelihoods and makes communities more resilient to disasters.   Takachihogo-Shiibayama Mountainous Agriculture and Forestry System in Miyazaki This site is located in a steep mountainous area where flat land is extremely scarce. In this severe environment, local people have established a distinctive and sustainable system of agriculture and forestry, which balances timber production with diverse farming activities -- such as terraced rice growing, shiitake mushroom cultivation, beef cattle raising, or tea cultivation. The forest is maintained as a \"mosaic\" of conifers and broadleaf trees using traditional practices."

Except, of course anyone can't and there are two dead cacti in the office to testify to that very fact. Sure, cactus aren't high maintenance but they aren't zero maintenance either. There are things you have to do to make sure a cactus lives as long as it is supposed to.  First, you need to dispel the myths. You may think that cactus don't need water because of how they survive in the desert and stuff but remember that there is a difference between surviving and thriving. During a cactus' growing season, between spring and into fall, your plant needs to be watered at least once a week. Add a bit of fertiliser every now and then too and make sure the water soaks the soil thoroughly but doesn't flood itself. Rainwater, devoid of alkaline, can be better than tap water so whenever possible collect rainwater for future use. As the weather cools and days become shorter, increase intervals between watering, unless your cactus grows in the winter. That's a different story.  This brings up the point, that more important than watering your cactus is actually understand your cactus. Like any plant, different cacti have different requirements and in the near future, before you fall prey to Plants Rights Activists, its best to have a defence ready. So learn about your plant well. Depending on what kind of cactus you have, you will have to prepare the lightning accordingly. If your cactus is getting too much sunlight, it will soon wear a bleached outlook and if it gets too little, the shape will change with the plant stretching towards the light. Sometimes, when light and heat changes rapidly, your cactus may actually scorch permanently so one needs to be careful towards that end too.  The next things for consideration are potting, what kind of soil to use and how to avoid pests. But those are things for another day. Our main concern today was the light and water because that's how our last two cacti died. If your cactus lives healthily past the first few months and the water and light don't bother you, then it is time to think soil and things. Having a plant is like having a baby. Having a cactus plant is like having a nasty baby. Of course, both are generally the same thing so have fun and get busy. Nurturing is not for the lazy. Photo: Collected"

It's a lot of work,\" 60-year-old Thien, who has been farming since he was a child, told AFP on the edge of his small paddy field.Experts say Vietnam's drive to become one of the world's leading rice exporters is pushing farmers in the fertile delta region to the brink, with mounting costs to the environment.The communist country is already the world's second largest exporter of the staple grain. But intensive rice cultivation, particularly the shift to producing three crops per year, is taking its toll on farmers and the ecosystem.\"Politicians want to be the world's number one or two rice exporter. As a scientist, I want to see more being done to protect farmers and the environment,\" said Vietnamese rice expert Vo Tong Xuan.A major famine in 1945 and food shortages in the post-war years led to the government adopting a \"rice first\" policy.This now generates far more of the crop than needed to feed Vietnam's 90 million population and has catalysed a thriving export industry.Rice yields have nearly quadrupled since the 1970s, official figures show, thanks to high-yield strains and the construction of a network of dykes that today allow farmers to grow up to three crops per year. The amount of land under cultivation in the Mekong Delta has also expanded and quotas are in place to prevent farmers from switching to other crops.But experts are questioning who really benefits.According to Xuan, farmers don't reap the rewards of the three crop system -- the rice is low quality and they spend more on pesticides and fertilisers, which become less effective year by year.He argues the delta would be better off if farmers cultivated a more diverse range of crops, from coconuts to prawns, with just the most suitable land used to grow rice.The country should consider abandoning the third crop and focus on improving quality and branding to sell Vietnamese rice at higher prices, he said.Currently, the bulk of Vietnam's rice is exported at cut-price costs on government-to-government contracts through large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) like the Southern Food Corporation, known as Vinafood 2.\"Over the last five years, the trend is towards lower-quality rice,\" admitted Le Huu Trang, deputy office manager at the firm.Some argue that such SOEs have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo as they earn lucrative kickbacks from the huge contracts.But even as salt water intrusion, drought and flooding increase in the delta -- to say nothing of agricultural chemical pollution -- it is also hard to convince farmers to change.\"The prevailing mindset is to grow three crops... we have to explain two crops is better,\" said Nguyen Tuan Hiep from the Co Do Agriculture company.Over the last 20 years, Co Do -- which is state-run but a flagship model of how the industry could evolve -- has identified the best rice-growing land in the delta and helped farmers expand their farms.They now work with 2,500 families on 5,900 hectares (14,600 acres) of land, enough for each family to make a living -- typically the average rice farm in the delta spans less than one hectare.The firm invests heavily in high-quality seeds and improving irrigation, while also advising farmers on the best chemicals to use.\"Two crops is more sustainable long term -- the soil is not degraded, the environment isn't polluted, and value of the rice increases,\" Hiep said.Climate change is another factor threatening the delta, according to the World Bank Group's vice president and special envoy for climate change Rachel Kyte.\"This is really ground zero for some of the most difficult adaptation, planning challenges that any country in the world has,\" she said.Ultimately Vietnam has tough choices to make, including whether to help people transition from a rice-based economy to aquaculture (fish or shellfish farming) or other crops, Kyte added.The environmental costs of maintaining Vietnam's current level of rice production are also rising.The system of dykes, which blocks flood water, are preventing soil nutrients from flowing freely and over time \"soil fertility will fade\", said Tran Ngoc Thac, deputy director of Vietnam's Rice Research Institute.Scientists there are busy trying to breed new strains of rice that require fewer fertilisers and can survive in extreme weather.\"If farmers don't change, if we can't find a suitable new rice strain, pollution will continue and incomes will drop,\" Thac said, adding these measures were essential to save the delta.

      "text": "Making a film at a time when it was impossible to find an experienced cast and crew, with no film production studio and a meagre budget, was no easy feat. Especially when this was the first Bengali film in East Bengal to ever be made. Abdul Jabbar Khan, an engineer by profession, and filmmaker and a dramatist by passion, took up this challenge, thereby cementing the history of Bengali cinema with his first talkie Mukh o Mukhosh, which was released on August 3, 1956. When in a meeting of cultural activists, F Dossani, a non-Bengali movie producer, commented that this region of then united Pakistan was not conducive for making films, the seed for Mukh O Mukhosh was taking form in Khan's head. Dossani's statement had in fact reverberated the perception of non-Bengali speaking distributors and producer groups who dominated the film scene.   Being fully aware that many Indian-Bengali films were partially shot in this very land, Khan was not convinced that films could not be made here. Following a heated argument with Dossani, Khan took up the challenge of making a Bengali movie, the first of its kind, in East Pakistan. With that vow, Khan's struggle began. Based on his play Dakaat, Khan started working on the movie in 1953, and worked on it for two years under the banner of Iqbal Films. The flood of 1954 made brought the shooting to a halt on more than one occasion.  Local actors, who had no prior experience of acting in films, performed in the movie for free. While Khan played an important role in the film, Inam Ahmed and Purnima Sen were the other protagonists of the film. Nazma (Peary), Zaharat Ara, Ali Mansur, Fafiq, Narul Anarn Khan, Saifuddin were also part of the cast. As there was no local film production studio, the reels had to travel through Shahnoor Studio, Lahore, for editing and printing. Finally, after being done with the processing, Khan could not bring the final prints home easily. He was restricted by the customs of West Pakistan who told him that he was not allowed to take the prints with him. Followed by a meeting with the home minister, Khan was not only able to bring the prints to this region, but was also asked to screen Mukh O Mukhosh at the Azaadi movie theatre for 200 Bengali speaking viewers living in Karachi. After completing the movie, when it was time for him to screen the movie in East Bengal, Khan went through another ordeal. At a time when the local theatres were dominated by Indian, Pakistani and Hollywood movies, most distributors and movie theatre owners did not show any interest in screening the Bengali-language movie. Finally, Khan was able to release the film in Roopmahal movie theatre where Sher-e-Bengali A K Fazlul Haque was present as the chief guest at the premiere show of the film.The movie was able to earn TK 48 thousand in the initial screening itself. Thus, the first 'talkie' in Bengali film industry was born. The original reel is preserved at the Bengalidesh Film Archive. For those who want to watch it at the comfort of their homes, there is a hazy version of the movie available on Youtube."

      "text": "With the existing Dhaka Metropolitan Development plan (DMDP) 1995-2015 mostly unimplemented, and its term expiring this year, Rajuk has embarked on drawing up a new master plan. The proposed Dhaka Structure Plan 2016-2035 is formulated under the City Region Development project funded by the ADB and Bangladesh government. Recently, Rajuk has presented the draft master plan in a seminar to seek opinion from experts and practitioners. But they should have done this at the initial stage of preparing the plan. However, I have serious reservations about the proposed draft. Firstly, there is no reflection of people's participation in the document. It has been formulated without taking urban experts and other relevant stakeholders on board. Even the local public representatives are not adequately informed about the plan.  Secondly, I do not find any strong logic behind changing the existing structure plan. It was prepared in 1995 and gazetted in 1997. Later a Detailed Area Plan (DAP), based on the structure plan, came into being in 2010. Initially, a few decisions were implemented under that DAP. But mostly, it has remained unimplemented due to strong protests from real estate owners and various interest groups. The government formed a seven-member review committee, comprising of seven ministers. But it failed to give any directives to carry forward the plan. Against this background, the logic of formulating another structural plan has very little relevance to me.  Housing Minister Mosharraf Hossain has said, \"Now we have to prepare a pragmatic DAP,\" referring to the existing DAP as a \"plan prepared at home\". He should keep in mind that the DAP was formulated by a government nominated engineer. We, under the leadership of Professor Jamilur Reza Choudhury, made the government aware of its various loopholes and assisted them to make it pro-people and pragmatic. There was an attempt in the earlier version of the plan to exempt land grabbers and real estates from the crime of grabbing flood flow zones and water bodies. But we insisted on incorporating a provision in the document that no one can be exempted for such unlawful activities after 2000, since the structural plan was gazzetted and made public in 1997. So I do not understand what the minister is trying to mean by the word 'pragmatic'.  My third point is related with the protection of flood flow zones, canals, rivers and flood water retention areas. Conservation of these water bodies is vital to prevent urban flooding, help ground percolation, drainage and overall liveability of the city. The way the document was prepared behind closed doors, we have valid reasons to fear whether Rajuk has prioritised people's interest or interest of a coterie since implementation of the existing DAP was stalled by real estate owners and land grabbers. Naryanganj City Mayor Dr. Selina Hayat Ivy has also expressed frustration saying that the proposed plan, foiling the existing one, had a deliberate attempt to legalise the acts of land grabbers.  Another important aspect is ensuring access to open spaces like parks and playgrounds. The proposed plan should have clear directives in this regard. The issue of affordable housing for the poor people should also be clearly addressed in the proposed plan.  I want to request the government to not proceed with the plan hastily. It needs to be critically evaluated by all the stakeholders. The government should incorporate their suggestions as well.

      "text": "Over a dozen government agencies are involved in maintaining the storm drainage in the capital. Yet the entire system collapses every time it rains, even when moderately, leaving most parts of the city waterlogged and throwing life out of gear. The main reasons for the failure in dealing with waterlogging in the capital are a lack of coordination among the authorities concerned, solid waste clogging up drains, and filling up of canals and other water retention bodies, according to experts and high officials of the agencies responsible for drainage development and maintenance. A single authority to look after the storm drainage system is a must to address waterlogging in the city, said Mayor Sayeed Khokon of Dhaka South City Corporation. And because of the absence of such an authority, none of the government agencies knows exactly how Dhaka's drainage system functions, said experts. Only 22 percent of the 360-sqkm area under the Water and Sewerage Authority (Wasa) in Dhaka is covered by storm drainage. So, more than one-fourth of the city area has to depend on narrow open drains and canals for water to recede, which is far from enough. Then again, solid waste clogs the 320-km storm drainage. What's worse is that the Wasa cleans up the drains only once a year, according to SDM Quamrul Alam Chowdhury, deputy managing director of the agency. To improve the waterlogging situation, the Wasa in 2012 installed some large diameter storm-water drains in some parts of Gulshan, Dhanmondi, Mirpur Darussalam area and Uttara areas. But it was done in such an isolated and piecemeal manner that the drains hardly help during heavy rains. There are 65km-long open canals which can serve as major storm water carriers. But they have been awfully constricted by indiscriminate encroachment and waste dumping, said Prof Md Mujibur Rahman of Civil Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology. There are some 10-km stretches of different canals which have been turned into box culverts, but they too mostly remain clogged with waste. The Wasa and the city corporations pass the buck between each other, he said. Recovery of designated flood plains and canals can largely rid the city of recurrent waterlogging, said Mujibur, who has worked on Dhaka's drainage system for around three decades. \"We have consistently lost dedicated flood flow zones and water retention areas to powerful real estate developers and the city canals to land grabbers. This has virtually chocked the city's entire storm drainage system. \"The situation will keep worsening unless strong actions are taken ... Any farcical show regarding saving the wetlands and canals will not make any difference,\" he added. The 2,000-km surface drains, maintained by the two city corporations, are supposed to feed the large diameter storm drains. But they remain heavily clogged with solid waste, said Mayor Annisul Huq of Dhaka North City Corporation. Even high-tech heavy machineries sometimes prove ineffectual in clearing the congestions, he said. \"I have instructed the ward councillors to come up with ideas on how to contain waterlogging in the city,\" said Huq, adding that he was going to take up a Tk 200-crore scheme in November to improve drainage and road condition in Gulshan, Banani and Baridhara within two years. \"Nobody exactly knows how the drainage system in the capital works,\" he said. Canals, rivers and water retention areas collect, carry and retain rainwater, and are connected with each other as a drainage network. But in recent decades, successive governments have repeatedly ignored warnings from the urban planners against allowing water retention areas and flood flow zones to be ruined for real estate projects, according to Urban Planner Khondaker M Ansar Hossain, who worked as a technical expert on the Detailed Area Plan (DAP) of Dhaka city. Since the DAP gazette notification in 2010, almost all the conservable wetlands have been filled up with the government's silent approbation, he alleged."

Nasir said governance of city corporations was totally dependent on the central government now, and he would request the prime minister to introduce city government. According to an April 24 report of The Daily Star, the city corporation does not have legal or financial mandate to work in a number of areas concerning power production, construction of waterways, conservation of flood plains, or introduction of commuter train services. There are different implementing agencies of the government for each area, it said. Every mayor feels the need of city government while they start working, Nasir said, adding that he would discuss the issue with other mayors. Nasir also said he would take every risk to implement the city master plans for the welfare of the residents. As a mayor, he said, he would maintain transparency and honesty in his work and would brook no corruption and political influence. The new mayor said Chittagong City Corporation (CCC) would start collecting garbage at night from September 1, to reduce traffic congestion and give people respite from the malodour spreading during waste collection. About the chronic and debilitating waterlogging of his city, Nasir said the corporation would prepare a comprehensive master plan to improve the drainage and sewerage system, and it had already got positive responses from the World Bank and Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) for funding. Initiatives were also taken to reclaim canals from the grabbers, he said. About the poor condition of the port city roads, Nasir said quality was not maintained during their construction.   It is necessary to take initiatives in a more planned way to repair roads, and he will ensure the quality of repairs, he said. Saif Islam Dilal, president of CJFD, also addressed the press conference.  "

I did not expect such an ordeal would start on the mountain road to the Kumano Magaibutsu stone Buddha reliefs, the first destination on my trip around the Kunisaki Peninsula in Oita Prefecture. Is it bad karma for my lifestyle full of worldly desires? I tried to soothe my screaming feet and calmed my breath. As I looked up, a wonderful scene came into view. Two Buddha statues can be seen on a protruding cliff. The Dainichi Nyorai Buddha statue is about 6.8 metres tall, while the Fudo-Myoo statue is about eight metres tall. The relief sculptures of the Buddha, which were engraved between the mid-Heian period (794-1192) and the early Kamakura period (1192-1333), look as grandiose as those in cave temples on the Asian mainland. Why are such great sculptures of Buddha in this place, far from the ancient capital of Kyoto or Nara? \nIn olden times, the Rokugo-Manzan culture flourished on the peninsula. It was the most brilliant and extensive Buddhist culture in Japan after those in Kyoto and Nara.\nThis is because most of the six provinces on the peninsula at that time were manors of the Usa Jingu shrine in the city of Usa in the prefecture. It is the head shrine of about 40,000 so-called Hachiman-sama Shinto shrines across the country.\n\"Usa Jingu is the place where the syncretising of beliefs in ancient Japanese gods and the Buddha took place, combining ancient Japanese deities with Buddhism. It probably started when monks of the Mirokuji temple, a Buddhist temple that used to be in the shrine's precinct as its affiliate, went out to live in and develop the peninsula while continuing with religious training,\" said Eishin Kono, the 62-year-old head priest of the Fukiji temple, one of the Rokugo-Manzan Buddhist temples on the peninsula.\nThe Odo pavilion of the temple is a national treasure and houses Amida-Nyorai-zazo, a seated statue of the Buddha Amida, which invites people to paradise. The statue is a government-designated important cultural asset. There are important cultural assets in the nearby Maki-Odo pavilion as well; nine Buddha statues gathered from defunct temples. The testament to faith that has lasted 1,000 years is lingering in mountains and rivers as if it is trying to hide.\nI pass few cars as I drive deep into the peninsula, probably because it is still winter. When I arrive at Kawanaka Fudo, I'm greeted by an image of the Fudo Myoo deity and other figures, engraved on a huge stone standing in the middle of a river. The deity that has endured rain and wind quietly regards the surface of the water.\n\n\"Choito yotchi michokure,\" a local phrase meaning, \"Drop by for a moment,\" invites me to a nearby shop, which sells fresh farm products. So I step inside.\n\"When I was a child, there was also a gomado pavilion in the river,\" said Junichi Otsuka, 78, who tends the shop. \"I would go there to pray, but the pavilion was washed away in the flood in 1941, leaving everything as it is now.\"\nThe Rokugo-Manzan culture is also a culture of stones. There are Kunisaki stone towers, a characteristic structure in this area, and juroku-rakan and jizo statues, each with different expressions, from happiness and joy to anger and sorrow. Buddha statues and towers made of stone are here and there beside the roads, accumulating moss. I've heard the peninsula is rich in stone as it is made from volcanic ejecta. In the ruins of the old Sendoji temple, I see stone monuments and objects, including a pair of Nio Buddhist guardians still standing. I feel a growing sense of loneliness.\n\"Kunisaki ya, karete izuku mo hotoke-michi (Kunisaki, being withered, has roads with Buddha everywhere.)\"\nI feel my heart twinge as I read the haiku by poet Toshiro Nomura, engraved on a monument at the Futagoji temple at the foot of Mt. Futago, the highest peak in the peninsula at 721 meters. Walking the path in the temple's precinct, I arrive at Okunoin Honden, or the main pavilion of the temple. The pavilion stands as if it is guarding a cave in the steep cliff behind it. Looking at the rock-ribbed facade of the pavilion, I think of the many monks who must have endured solitude, and trained over and over in seeking enlightenment like the Buddha.\nI leave the loneliness of the wintry mountain behind and head toward the seashore to sate my hunger.\nAt the Michi no Eki Kunisaki rest area, there is a restaurant called Gintachi no Sato, which is run directly by Oita Prefecture's fisheries cooperative. I order the popular tachi-ju bento - a box of rice and tachiuo, a type of cutlassfish caught in abundance in the sea near Kunisaki. When served on the rice, the white fish flesh looks like grilled eel, but its softness crumbles in my mouth.\nHow delicious! I felt gratitude that my appetite was part of my worldly desires.\nTravel tips:From Haneda Airport in Tokyo, it takes about an hour and 40 minutes to Oita Airport in the city of Kunisaki.

Futago, the highest peak in the peninsula at 721 meters. Walking the path in the temple's precinct, I arrive at Okunoin Honden, or the main pavilion of the temple. The pavilion stands as if it is guarding a cave in the steep cliff behind it. Looking at the rock-ribbed facade of the pavilion, I think of the many monks who must have endured solitude, and trained over and over in seeking enlightenment like the Buddha. I leave the loneliness of the wintry mountain behind and head toward the seashore to sate my hunger. At the Michi no Eki Kunisaki rest area, there is a restaurant called Gintachi no Sato, which is run directly by Oita Prefecture's fisheries cooperative. I order the popular tachi-ju bento - a box of rice and tachiuo, a type of cutlassfish caught in abundance in the sea near Kunisaki. When served on the rice, the white fish flesh looks like grilled eel, but its softness crumbles in my mouth. How delicious! I felt gratitude that my appetite was part of my worldly desires. Travel tips:From Haneda Airport in Tokyo, it takes about an hour and 40 minutes to Oita Airport in the city of Kunisaki. For information on travelling around the peninsula, call Bungotakada Tourist Association at (0978) 22-3100 or Kunisaki Tourist Association at (0978) 72-5168.

      "text": "TWO-thirds god, one-third man -- Gilgamesh, King of the Sumerian city of Uruk, with an enviable physical structure, transcendent valor, and unparalleled wisdom holds the prelude of the most ancient epic written; built stupendous ziggurats, temple towers; surrounded his city with high walls, and laid out its orchards and fields.  But this godly King was a malicious tyrant and womanizer whose Kingdom always whimpered under his despotism. The gods, as planned to unwind him, sent a feral being -- Enkidu, as bravura as Gilgamesh. They turned out to be bosom chums. Together they thieved trees from cedar forest prohibited for mortals slaying the guard, devotee of god Enlil, the petrifying demon Humbaba.  The goddess of love, Ishtar sent the rampaging Bull of Heaven with seven years of starvation down to earth as vengeance for Gilgamesh's scorn to her spilling lust.  They slaughtered it. But Enkidu was sentenced for their contravention incurring Ishtar's ire. Gilgamesh's world smashed into smithereens. Forlorn and tormented about own demise, he trekked to the periphery of the earth. He found immortal Utnapishtim (the Mesopotamian Noah) beyond Mashu, the two-peaked mountain braving scorpion-monsters; and implored his pursuit. Utnapishtim induced and sent him back.  But eavesdropping on Utnapishtim and his wife's chat, he found the astounding plant of youth that was  stolen by a snake one night while camping. Unlike the heroes of Greek or Celtic mythology, the hero of  The Epic of Gilgamesh was an actual historical figure, a king who reigned over the Sumerian city-state of Uruk around 2700 B.C. Long after his death, people worshipped Gilgamesh, renowned as a warrior and builder and widely celebrated for his wisdom and judiciousness. One prayer invokes him as \"Gilgamesh, supreme king, judge of the Anunnaki\" (the gods of the underworld). Called Erech in the Bible, Uruk was one of the great cities of ancient Mesopotamia. The historical King Gilgamesh probably raised its walls, which archaeologists have determined had a perimeter of six miles. Today its ruins rest near the town of Warka, in southern Iraq, about a third of the way from Basra to Baghdad.  Dozens of stories about Gilgamesh circulated throughout the ancient Middle East. Archaeologists have discovered the earliest ones, inscribed on clay tablets in the Sumerian language before 2000 B.C. Other tablets tell stories about him in the Elamite, Hurrian, and Hittite tongues. Over time, many of those stories were consolidated into a large, epic work. The most complete known version of this long poem was found in Nineveh, in the ruins of the library of Assurbanipal, the last great king of the Assyrian empire. Assurbanipal was undoubtedly a despot and a warmonger, but he was also a tireless archivist and collector--we owe much of our knowledge about ancient Mesopotamia to his efforts. The serpent had slinked away; it molted and received adolescence. Empty, Gilgamesh returned to Uruk but at last merged to mortality. The city his own, drowned in terror, came to his sight as an enduring triumph as desirable as immortality. This perilous yet cathartic journey of learning: \"Life, which you look for, you will never find. For when the gods created man, they let death be his share, and life withheld in their own hands.\" granted Gilgamesh intransience by sealing his name in humans' hearts for his numerous building works, his preaching of story about the time before inundation and all the godly clandestine undisclosed.  This is the inner of The Epic of Gilgamesh discovered by Hormuzd Rassam in 1853 in 'cuneiform' on twelve plates as an emblem of time 3200 BC predating even Homer's Iliad by roughly 1500 years. Its influence was later found in biblical and classical literature. Many of the Epic's characters also have myths allied indirectly with close biblical resemblance. The intimacy between Enkidu-Shamhat could be recognized as Adam-Eve in the Garden of Eden; the snake stealing the plant of youth came up with another parallel. Conspicuous is the way the Genesis flood story follows the Gilgamesh flood tale. Even its influence on Homer and in popular culture, literature, art and music was marked. But the image of the hereafter was austere, according to Enkidu, souls (represented as humans covered in scruffy bird feathers) cringe in a bleak city of dust, eating clay to survive; this contrasts with the views of other ancient religions such as the Egyptians and the Greeks which assured their adherents 'paradise' though it is vague from the Epic what role the gods themselves serve in the Sumerian afterlife. To sum up, The Epic of Gilgamesh is both a spiritual treatise and a decisive effort of ancient literature.

      "text": "The Louhajang River in the district is heading towards virtual death due to mindless encroachment on the once profusely flowing river. The river was at least 150 feet wide only two decades ago but mindless grabbing on both banks at different locations, especially in Tangail municipality area, has already turned it into a narrow canal, Water Development Board (WDB) sources said.  At places it is only 60 feet wide now. Following the CS and RS records, local land office detected around 2000 illegal structures including concrete houses that were constructed grabbing the river, said sources at the office of the assistant commissioner (Land) in Tangail Sadar upazila. Originating from the Dhaleswari, a tributary of the Jamuna, at Baisnabbari in Sadar upazila, the 35-kilometre-long Louhajang River flows through Tangail town and falls into the Bangshai at Jamurki in Mirzapur upazila. Till the 1980s, launches and big boats carrying merchandise used to anchor in Tangail and a road at College Para in the town was named Amghat as mangoes from Rajshahi were unloaded there, said several senior citizens of Tangail town. The river, however, started dying after the Water Development Board (WDB) constructed a sluice gate near the confluence of Louhajang and Dhaleswari rivers in 1992 under its Flood Action Plan (FAP)-20. Large boats stopped plying the route as the river lost navigability. The subsequent years saw widespread encroachment on the river bank areas. During a recent visit, this correspondent saw locals built different structures including houses and raised orchards, occupying the river areas on both sides. Illegal concrete structures have been built in many areas including West Akur Takur Para, Akur Takur Para, Muslim Para, Enayetpur, Kagmara, Stadium Area, Paradise Para Beradoma, Dighulia, Kagmari, Kochua Danga, Aloa, and Mirer Betka areas in the town. Moreover, sewage and garbage released from riverside homesteads and toxic wastes released from several mills and factories of Tangail BSCIC Industrial area at Taratia and  a textile mill at Khudirampur badly pollute the river, turning its water unusable not only for people but also for cattle, said green activist Masum Ferdous. The townspeople, professionals and environmentalists held different programmes urging the authorities concerned to free the Louhajang River from the grabbers and polluters and arrange dredging for bringing back its navigability, he said.     Contacted, Tangail Deputy Commissioner Mahbub Hossain said they will demarcate the AD (alluvium diluvium) line of the river when the water recedes and also conduct an eviction drive to free the river."

      "text": "Tahsan really needs no introduction. It'll be very hard to find anyone in the country who hasn't heard of him. His introduction into the music scene was met with massive positive response and his popularity is rising everyday. Although his first identity is that of a musician and singer, he has also successfully ventured into the world of acting. As if all those things weren't impressive enough, he is also a Professor at BRAC University! He is not only talented but also highly educated. His wife Mithila is just as impressive. Also a singer and actor, her passion is development work and she wishes to work more to support the underprivileged in the future. The multi-tasking dynamic duo recently became parents. Star Showbiz recently caught up with both of them to learn more about their lives.\n OPPOSITES ATTRACTTahsan: We met through a common friend. Back then, I think only me and Habib was in the musical spotlight in Bangladesh, considering young artists. Add in the fact that I was single back then, I received a lot of unwanted attention from girls! This created quite a difficult situation for me because I had to be extra careful wherever I went and think twice before saying anything. But Mithila was different. When we met, she didn't really pay me much attention at all! This was honestly very refreshing for a change! This lack of attention created a great curiosity which led to a massive attraction. Through more and more interactions, I found that she also studied in Dhaka University and she has a singing background. I was recording for my album at that time and I needed a female vocal so I asked her to audition and then we did the song \"Brittalpona\" together. We became a couple through that collaboration.Mithila: Not paying him attention might not have been all that intentional! I come from a singing background and I performed on stage too. So I guess when we met, I wasn't too awe struck. When I started to get the feeling that he was interested in me, I didn't over react. After 2-3 months of talking, we finally started to get together. To me, I think our relationship works because we are completely opposite to one another in terms of our habits and outlook. I am more of an outdoorsy and outspoken woman and he likes being at home and is a very quiet man. LOVE AND MARRIAGETahsan and Mithila: Our marriage of eight years has been full of ups and downs. When you are with the same person every day, it's very hard to find something new because you know them completely. People nowadays spend a lot of time thinking about getting married, but we didn't. We just fell in love and got married, didn't really think about anything else.\n  BUNDLE OF JOYTahsan: Before our baby was born, we were a bit selfish. What I mean is, regardless of whatever decision we took, no matter how much we compromised for one another, the truth is we were looking out for our interest first, which is the basic human instinct. With the birth of our baby, everything we do and everything we decide on is based on what will benefit our baby the most. Our child has become the center of attention for us. Every person has a role. Her role as a girl is one, as a wife, another. But in her role as a mother, which is my favorite, I think she is perfect!Mithila: Before, we were very independent and certain freedoms, for example if we had a fight before, it didn't matter how soon we patched up! Now, with all the responsibilities and duties that befall a mother, I just don't have the time to even think about all these as my baby is my first priority.   ACTING CAREERTahsan: When you work in the media and when the audience accepts you, you will surely get offers and requests from many to work in their projects. When I got a request from Mimi apa, I had to oblige and give acting a go. But I felt that this isn't really my scene so I bowed out after that production. After about five years, I worked with Shihab Shahin on \"Mon Furing er Golpo\" and I realized that if I was such a bad actor, people wouldn't have received it as well as they did. It doesn't matter how dedicated a fan base I have, it can't justify the high TRP score that telefilm achieved. After seeing this response, I decided not to avoid acting anymore and began participating in projects whenever I found good scripts. I also decided to get involved in about 2-3 projects especially around Eid or Valentine's Day every year.Mithila: I came into acting through with a TV commercial. The first commercial I did was for Closeup Toothpaste directed by Amitabh Reza, a family friend. Back then he was just starting out as a director and he called me up and asked me and my sister Meem to act in it. After that, I starred in a lot of other commercials directed by Amitabh. The first TV drama I worked on was by Ridwan Ronny. He asked me to act for an Eid drama but back then, I wasn't really interested so I turned down the offer. He called me again the next year around Eid time again and asked if I changed my mind. By that time I was married and I consulted with Tahsan who encouraged me, so I decided to give the project a shot. After that, I did a couple of other projects, amongst which, was the popular TV serial \"House Full\". After that, I started doing projects in earnest. I guess I did something similar to Tahsan in that I also needed to see my acting potential before I jumped in!\n  LIVING MULTIPLE LIVESTahsan: I love singing. That's my passion. And I wished that the music industry was a good place to work in but it isn't. It's a loss career. The scenario is different now and artists barely manage. This is one of the reasons why I act as well. I must be honest about the fact that I don't enjoy acting anywhere near the amount I enjoy singing. My other profession, which I enjoy as much as singing is teaching as it provides me a lot of mental peace. It feels like I am like everyone else.Mithila: I don't really have all that much love for the media industry. I am a development worker and I like working with the people in the country who needs my help. At the moment I am not working in the grassroots, but I wish to be as active as possible in in implementing projects in rural Bangladesh in the future. MEDIA LANDSCAPETahsan and Mithila: The shortsightedness of the channel owners is leading to the downfall of the industry. Their short-term profit expectations are the main reason for the pitiful situation of the industry. The budgets for productions are too small to produce quality dramas, so the makers are scammed. The true victim of this is the audience. To raise money, they flood a 30 min program with 20 minutes of advertisements. This would steer away any audience and that's why the audiences go to other programs in foreign channels.

      "text": "Hurricane Patricia caused less damage than feared on Mexico's Pacific coast on Saturday, but hammered an isolated part of the shoreline dotted with luxury villas and fishing villages, where the storm and its 165 mph (266 kph) winds landed. Thousands of residents and tourists fled the advance of the storm, one of the strongest in recorded history, seeking refuge in hastily arranged shelters. There were no early reports of deaths and it appeared major damage was averted as Patricia missed tourist centres like Puerto Vallarta and the major cargo port of Manzanillo. However, the storm carved through small rural villages, ripping corrugated metal roofing off modest brick homes and uprooting trees, with the forceful winds sucking the leaves off them. \"I've lost everything, I don't even have anywhere to sleep,\" said Roberto Gonzalez, a farmer, as he salvaged belongings from mangled debris of trash, toys and branches strewn across his hamlet of Chamela near the coast of Jalisco state, which took a direct hit. His mattress was tossed about 20 feet (6 meters) away from his house. A hole gaped where his roof used to sit. Power lines were knocked down in some of the worst damage electricity board repairmen had ever seen. Around three-quarters of some 50 modest homes in Chamela were wrecked. Residents had been evacuated to a shelter. Phone lines remain down where the storm hit in the nearby settlement of Cuixmala, the site of one of Mexico's most exclusive getaways located between Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta. It was unclear how bad the situation was there. Flooding streets and battering buildings, Patricia hit land as a Category 5 hurricane on Friday evening before grinding inland. It moved quickly but lost power in the mountains that rise up along the Pacific coast and was downgraded to a tropical depression on Saturday as it headed through central Mexico. Hurricane Patricia, a Category 5 storm, is seen in an infrared image taken by NASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP satellite as it approaches the coast of Mexico at 05:20 EDT October 23, 2015. Photo:Reuters\n Experts said the storm's speed meant it did not saturate the ground and trigger the major flooding feared. It was then broken up by high mountains, limiting the damage. \"The most important thing is that you are safe, that the menacing force of this hurricane could be faced and overcome and most importantly that you followed the recommendations of emergency services,\" President Enrique Pena Nieto said during a visit to Colima, which escaped the worst of the storm. In Puerto Vallarta, where 15,000 tourists had been hastily evacuated on Friday night, hotel workers began sweeping up the debris and removing boards from windows as the sun peeked out of the clouds. The airport reopened to start ferrying tourists back home and buses crowded the streets. Away from the more populated areas, residents described awaking to a scene of chaos after a terrifying night. \"We were sobbing, I thought everything was going to collapse around us,\" said Jose Angel Perez, 58, who sells coconuts in the municipality of Casimiro Castillo in Jalisco state, which lay in the storm's path. Whipping winds blew part of his roof away. In its march north, Patricia was likely to make matters worse in Texas, which saw heavy rains overnight from a separate storm system that caused flooding powerful enough to knock over a freight train. Officials said moisture from Patricia would increase the intensity of rains swamping parts of the state by Sunday. A woman is pictured in her badly damaged home after it was hit by Hurricane Patriacia in the town of Chamela near Punto Perula, in the Mexican state of Colima, October 24, 2015. Photo: Reuters\n In Puerto Vallarta, most of the evacuated tourists had been able to return to their hotels on Friday night, officials said Patricia's edges brushed Manzanillo port, a main transit point for Mexico's car and mining exports. But there was no major damage and operations were set to resume on Saturday afternoon. Mega-Storm\n At one point generating sustained winds of up to 200 mph (322 kph), Patricia was the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere. Even though it lost some power before coming ashore, it was still a Category 5 storm, the strongest on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. Such storms are relatively rare and are capable of causing devastating destruction. Patricia's ferocious core was relatively small, with hurricane force winds extending 35 miles (55 km) from the centre, the US National Hurricane Center said. This meant Puerto Vallarta and Manzanillo were spared the worst. The hurricane's centre hit land on Friday evening near the area of Cuixmala, the NHC said. Founded by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith, the resort at Cuixmala has played host over the years to a colourful assortment of world leaders, musicians and eccentric billionaires. Maria Pavon, a Cuixmala reservations booker based in the inland city of Colima, said there were no guests staying when the storm hit as they had all been evacuated. But there was no word yet on the state of the resort. She and colleagues had been unable to make contact as phone lines were down, Pavon said. The area around Cuixmala is sparsely populated, but there are small towns, and it was not clear yet how much damage they had suffered. Once inland, Patricia rapidly lost power. By Saturday afternoon, it had degenerated from a tropical depression into a remnant low with maximum winds down to about 30 mph (48 kph), the Miami-based Hurricane Center said. Patricia was located about 45 miles (72 km) southwest of the city of Monterrey, heading northeast at 22 mph (35 kph), the centre said. It could, however, pose a flood threat, the NHC said. Patricia became a tropical storm on Thursday and strengthened with stunning speed as it closed in on the Mexican coast. Meteorological authorities compared it to Typhoon Haiyan, which killed over 6,300 people in the Philippines in 2013. The strongest storm on record was Cyclone Tip which hit Japan in 1979.    "

General Rao Forman Ali, however, had different views. He noted, \"At last, they (Bangalis) thought of the possibility of ruling Pakistan. Mujib wanted to be the Prime Minister (of Pakistan). (But after the postponement of the National Assembly) He came to the conclusion that the combined forces of the Military and the PPP would not let materialise his desire to be the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Therefore, he decided to be the FATHER of a new nation\".  James J Novak, who lived in Bangladesh for 20 years since 1970, in his beautiful book Bangladesh: Reflections on the Water presented a brilliant depiction of Sheikh Mujib as the politician and the leader of our independence movement. In the words of Novak, \"Sheikh Mujib brought an immediacy to the political environment. He never tired the people by sophisticated ploys or half-measures.  He had no love for the government office. While he never said so on record, from the time he emerged until the time the Pakistanis arrested him on the day the liberation war began, everyone knew he spoke for independence. Not by proclaiming his end, he scared the Pakistanis. And all the while, Mujib could wink and smile and speak of Bengal, and of Bangladesh, as though it were free to rejoice in green-and-red flags fluttering on rooftops\".  However, the ground for this transition from six-point to one point did not happen in a day or a month. In the words of Novak, \"Long before the Liberation War, Mujib assumed for East Bengal the mantle of poor victims of Pakistani aggression thereby giving Bengalis the moral exultation of blameless. Whatever his beliefs, it was his personality that made him the pivotal figure of his era. He represented an elemental force, a comet in politics. Basically, he was an intuitive force, one whose personality and action inspired the pit of Bangladesh mind. His desire for independence radiated as much from the people as it did from his own intellectual outlook. He proved to be a vessel through which the people's desire were to flow\".    As Socrates long ago recognised, poets are really rhetoricians, politicians, who appeal to emotive as well as reasoned positions. In the words of Novak, \"Mujib also played up the superiority of Bengali culture compared to that of military and martial Pakistani Punjabis. Thus, he countered Hindu and Muslim Bengali poetry to that of the great poet of Pakistan Mohammad Iqbal, who had been the inspiration of an independent Muslim state, while relying on the verses of the son-of-the-soil Kazi Nazrul Islam. Mujib understood the aural and artistic quality of Bengali mind and the role of poetry in explicating moral positions. As there is a saying, 'Bengalis never believe anything until there is a poet to articulate it'.  He emphasised the works of Tagore, the only Bengali poet equal to Iqbal, who was a Bengali native son and much beloved. Ultimately, so effective was Mujib's poet-tactic that the Pakistani government tried to ban as subversive the singing of Tagore songs. Of course, that is what had been intended\".     Referring to his hard work and simplicity, Novak observed, \"The Muslim Leaguers, Anglified and Westernised, felt more at home in London than Dhaka, in airplanes than in country boats. As for the Sheikh, hard work shaped his style. Indefatigable, he walked across fields from village to village, and mingled with the people, sharing their tea, rice, dhal, and salt, remembering names, praying at mosques, sweating in fields, visiting flood sites, weeping at funerals and milads. He empathized mightily, instituted sympathetically, and reached out and touched - not golf clubs and club chairs but the people's sweaty hands. He knew what the people believed because he could explain things not only in terms they could understand but in one they respected. Knowing that, they believed he did not need to lie\".  During the nine-months of genocide, amidst armed struggles and untold sufferings, Sheikh Mujib's name glowed ceaselessly in the hearts of millions and he remained a demigod to the people of Bangladesh. In the words of General Rao Forman Ali, \"90 percent of the people of Bangladesh were taken in by the magical power of Sheikh Mujib, and they were ready to sacrifice their lives for the creation of Bangladesh\".  In the world-wide survey of BBC Bengali service listeners, while he was voted the greatest Bengali ever born, BBC surmised the opinions of the listeners as follows: \"He was the beacon in the darkness that had befallen on the Bengali people during the semi-colonial Pakistani era. His political wisdom, uncompromising leadership for the cause of the Bengalis united the Bengali people, for the first time in history, not only within the geographical boundaries of Bangladesh, but all over the world, and gave them nationhood. Bengalis all over the world, who cherish the citizenship of Bangladesh, owe this nationhood to the leadership of one person and he is no other than Sheikh Mujibur Rahman\".  The tragic hero, Aristotle wrote, suffers a change in fortune because of a mistaken act to which is led by his \"error in judgement\" or his \"tragic flaw\". Such a man moves us to pity because his misfortune is greater than he deserves. Mujib was indeed a tragic hero.  A Turkish saying that Kamal Ataturk was fond of quoting: \"History is ruthless to him who is without ruthlessness\".  This was echoed in the epitaph of the book, Sheikh Mujib: Triumph and Tragedy where the author S A Karim concluded, \"Mujib sought to put the interest of his countrymen before his own. If he failed, it was mainly because he lacked ruthlessness without which a state cannot be governed in difficult times. But his failure as a ruler does not diminish his grandeur as a human being. He will live in the hearts of his countrymen\".   Let me conclude with an excerpt from Novak's book. In the words of Novak, \"He was a very simple man with a simple set of beliefs in his nation and people. If he failed, people never betrayed him and only brought out the best in him. Yet he is BANGABANDHU, the FATHER of the NATION--not as a perfect statesman, but as a man who felt deeply about his people. He was man who flew as high as a man can fly. How many of us would have done better\"? The writer is the Convenor of the Canadian Committee for Human Rights and Democracy in Bangladesh. He writes from Toronto, Canada."

Recently, Jaago foundation teamed up with Kaymu.com for the first time and organised a friendly football tournament between all non profit youth organisations. In hope to work as one team in the future and also for the betterment of the youth and the country, the event was named 'Kick For Hope'.  The tournament was held on October 10 at the Banani Swat Field. As soon as the clock hit 8:00 am, Banani Swat Field began to flood with youngsters. All were in groups and getting ready for the matches. These youngsters represented different youth organisations. Apart from Jaago's volunteer wing VBD (Volunteer for Bangladesh), 11 different youth organisations such as Bangladesh Youth Leadership Centre, Critical Link, One Degree Initiative, Change, BDCyclists, Human Aid Bangladesh, took part in this event.  The event started off with the first match of group A. As soon as it started, fans supporting their respective organisations screamed in enthusiasm. Though it was a tournament for a cause, each of the organisations showed professional skills on the field. One of the teams which were noticeable for their outstanding defence on the field was BDCyclists. The commentators suggested that this greatness in skill was due to their everyday cycling. The striker of team Born to Smile also showed huge potential and throughout became a favourite in the event.  As time flew, the event was getting close to their final match. The final teams were VBD and Born to Smile. Just before the final match, another surprise was awaiting for the teams and the spectators. Before the announcement of the final match, legendary commentator Chowdhury Jafarullah Sharafat entered the field and he took the commentators place for the final match. This was a great boost for both of the final teams.  The final match was a nail biter, each of the teams giving their best possible effort. Though it was a close shot, Born to Smile finally won the Kick For Hope cup.  The tournament was a huge success. It showed that when the time comes these organisation can unitedly serve the country. \"We never get a chance to do something together. This was an opportunity where  we showed everyone that there is unity among us and no matter which sectors we are working in, when the time comes, we can all be one big team,\" says Korvi Rakhshand, founder of Jaago. At the closing ceremony, each of the team members received a football along with goodies which they promised to donate to a child in need."

What do you think was the motive behind the killing of intellectuals on December 14? What would you say was the impact of this systematic killing on Bangladesh?  The role of intellectuals in Bangalee life has always been very significant, at least since the 19th century when there was a Renaissance in Bengal. From then on, in our intellectual practices and cultural sensibilities, in the realisation of our deep sense of life or in our perspective of worldly affairs, Bangalee intellectuals' contributions have been crucial, more so, in fact, than that of intellectuals in any other part of the subcontinent. The anti-colonial movement against the British was a movement of the intellectual and educated classes. Intellectuals were and have always been integral to resistance, as they were in our struggle for liberation. Our movement for liberation was more cultural than it was political, because it was born over language. What began as a linguistic and cultural movement slowly turned into a political one, with the intellectuals at its helm. Why did the Pakistanis kill the intellectual leaders? Is it because they thought if they could kill a few intellectuals, Bangladesh's future would be paralysed? Is Bangladesh so intellectually bankrupt that this would happen? No. This, I think, was vindictiveness on their part, because they believed it was the intellectuals who destroyed Pakistan. I personally think that this idea did not only come from the Pakistanis, but also from the Bangalee collaborators, like Al-Badr and Al-Shams.   The 50s and 60s, it has been said, were a golden era for the intellectuals of East Bengal. Would you share a few memories of those times?    The language movement was a movement of the cultural, educated, liberal and secular youth of this land. At the time, the middle class was only just expanding, and it was the youth in whom we saw the reflection of a modern, progressive world. They felt in their very consciousness the importance of language, the importance of taking a stance against the two-state theory, against the idea of a religious state. Through the 1954 election, some progressive groups came to power and the Muslim League along with the idea of a religion-based Pakistan was rejected. Maybe these groups didn't have the experience or the aptitude to succeed - or perhaps the state structure was such that they weren't allowed to succeed - which enabled Ayub Khan to ascend to power within a few years. And then followed a dark period in our history, Bangalee culture was all but in the grave at that time. It was a radical thing to even celebrate Tagore's 100th birth anniversary. You remember Shamsur Rahman's poem at the time: \"Gaan bondho kor tora, nortoki nacher mudra bhol...\" (Stop singing you all, dancer, forget your techniques). You couldn't even talk about your culture. Bangalee's lives and dreams, poems and prose, were squashed under Ayub Khan's boots. Rabindranath Tagore was a cultural symbol for the Bangalees, and so you weren't allowed to publicly celebrate him. We had to wage a movement in '61 to observe the day. It was a small but significant movement against the repression of the Bangalee spirit.  Then came the Education Movement of 1962 which was, again, a cultural movement. In fact, most movements since the formation of Pakistan were movements waged for culture, creativity, freedom of thought and ideas, whose leadership was provided by educated Bangalees. When the movements gained momentum, politics took over - that is only natural. But even then, the role of the intellectual didn't diminish - the ideas of socialism, secularism, autonomy... how did they find their way in the vocabulary of politics? Bangladesh was formed by the people led by the politicians, but the groundwork was done by the intellectuals. It was the intelligentsia which generated the consciousness of the nation.   Intellectuals were not dependent on their intellect alone, but also on values. Back then there were a lot of highly educated, visionary people, with the power to make establishments quiver. Today there are a lot of people with fancy degrees, but a severe lack of well-educated, self-sacrificing people who are willing to dedicate their lives for a better cause. Back then, people respected intellectuals and believed in them. When they made a statement, people listened, people were moved. It's questionable if intellectuals have that kind of power in our society any more. The erosion of values that has gripped all of society has not spared the intellectuals.  As you highlight so eloquently, intellectuals were instrumental in catalysing the independence struggle. What happened to this tradition of activism driven by intellectuals, after independence?  The situation before and after independence was completely different. Not only different, it was the opposite. I actually think that the atmosphere of British rule continued in the country till '71. The British might have left in '47, but their administrative and state structures as well as their value system stayed with us more or less till '71, whether through Pakistani rule or through us. After all, a 200-year-old regime does not disappear overnight.    I have been severely critiqued for saying this -- that during British rule, there was a history of good governance. The one crucial thing that was missing there was: rights. Of course, when you occupy another's state through force, you cannot ensure human rights. But apart from this, most of the other values that were present in England were also present amongst us - we had the same laws, and values of justice and fairness. There was no bribery, no cheating in exams. In fact, the terminology \"erosion of values\" didn't enter Bangla Literature till 1947. It has been used increasingly since then, and has been used the most in recent times. Bangladesh was born in '71. A human baby cannot run as soon as it is born, neither can a nation. 10 years ago, as I was entering the Tower of London, I was reminded of the long history of the British state, of the experiences, values, discipline and humanity that it has developed over a thousand years. How can we achieve what a 1000-year-old state achieved within a day? If not a 1000 years, we need at least a century to organise ourselves. One big reason why we couldn't run the state properly after independence was because we didn't have any prior experience in running state machineries. Never before had we run a state independently. Our maximum experience was in running the village panchayat, as Tagore highlighted as well. The village was our administrative unit. What could we expect from a people who had nothing - people who were lost, hungry, uneducated, people who had a dark past --  but who were suddenly presented with a state and limitless opportunities to plunder and loot from it? There was corruption and pillage on all fronts. Shatter the state, shatter all values, shatter good governance, to enable us to plunder more! Doors to Hong Kong, Dubai, Bangkok, Singapore, Australia, England, America opened; could we expect this poor, famished populace to just sit back and watch? They began to attack the state from all fronts. And the intellectuals? Can we expect them to be standing when the rest of society is in shatters? Tell me, who is standing in our society except plunderers?   But what prompted such rapid erosion of our moral values?  Well, our moral values were borrowed from the British to a large extent. Bengal was the only place outside of Europe where the Renaissance took place. Yes, it happened in Japan as well, but they had their own interpretation of it. The values of the British, even though we embraced them and molded them to suit us, were foreign to our own culture; they did not emerge from our everyday lives, from our own system and structures. If our independence struggle had lasted a long time, we would have been able to develop an independent value-system and structure of governance. But we got our independence in a short time.  And after independence, as I explained, the push was to shatter all values. The war of 71 was the war of independence. But another, perhaps more important, war is waiting for us. It's not a war against an external enemy; it's not a short-term war. It is a war against ourselves, against the sins, greed, laziness, corruption and criminality within us.  This is an eternal war, and this is the real liberation war. Independence can be achieved, but the war of liberation must go on.   So would you say that at a time like this, when we are confronted with so many crises, especially political and moral, the need for our intellectuals to rise again is more crucial than ever? There has been an erosion of values of the intelligentsia as well. Criminalisation and plunderisation has not left them untouched. There is a famous poem by Bharatchandra, \"Nogor purle debaloy ki erae?\"(When the city burns, is the place of worship spared?). When all of society is in ruins, it is natural that the intellectuals, too, would be destroyed, that intellectualism would die. And yet, it doesn't die. After every flood, comes resurrection. Intellectuals will rise again, but it will take time.  At this moment, there is no strong voice of the intellectuals, or even if there is, we cannot hear them. Political society has all but engulfed civil society. In all civil society organisations, we see the dominance of politics and of politicians. Only those are free who do not need the state for survival. Back in the days, the position of the headmaster was a revered one, but now this position is held by the nephew of this MP or the uncle of that politician. It's the same with our doctors and lawyers.  But all hope is not lost. The conditions are being created for the emergence of a new intellectual class. Be it because of the culture of plunder, but along with creation of wealth, we are also witnessing more and more young people who are interested in reading, writing and thinking, and are concerned about our future.  Education can play a crucial role here [in creating the right conditions]. Other sectors are important too, but education is especially so because values are born here. Ultimately England is run by Oxford, Cambridge and similar other institutions. The values that are created there become the values of the nation. The main educational institutions become the moral compass of a nation, for the most part. So we must undertake the difficult task of cultivating progressive values. Once your values are gone, it is hard to get it back. It is possible to rebuild if you lose infrastructure - as Japan and Germany did after World War II- but if you lose your sense of collective morality, it takes a lot longer to stand back up again.   We seem to be witnessing the degradation of values on a global scale as well... In the last 500 years, the world has seen incredible progress in art, philosophy, literature and science, but now it seems everything has dried up. Now the only thing that is important is money-making, this indomitable quest for affluence. And money is the only thing that has no morality, no values. The whole world now seems to be aspiring to be the US. But it doesn't mean our fall is absolute. When a car goes up a hill, we can say symbolically that it is progressing. But when it descends, do we say it's going backwards? No, because the wheels are still going forward. The car must come down, so it can go up another hill. We can call it progressive decay. It is a historical phase, and we have to accept this. But we must keep on fighting."

The application of which a new genetically characterised organism is created by introducing a new character or genetic carrier or gene in any organism found from that organism or from any wild species thereof or from completely different type of organism. The term GMO or LMO (Living Modified Organism) are used interchangeably to denote the same thing pertaining to modern biotechnology. In the context of Bangladesh, GM crops and foods are highly debated issue over the last few years. This issue at first drew the attention of Bangladeshi people after the agreement between Monsanto and Grameen Bank in 1998. On 30th October 2013 Government by a notification approved to cultivate Bt. Brinjal and by that Bangladesh becomes the first in South Asia to grow a GM food crop. The promoters of GM crops or foods argue that, Bangladesh's population is increasing rapidly but cultivable land is decreasing at1% per year, agriculture is also threatened by adverse impacts of climate change (i.e. salinity, drought, flood, storm), insects and diseases. So, high yielding GMOs (e.g. Golden Rice, Bt. Brinjal and GM Banana) will be the miracle solution to meet demands of food production and nutrition. On the other hand, environmentalists allege that, some international companies are trying to deprive Bangladesh from her rich variety of agricultural crops by appropriating and displacing them by introducing their own GM crops. This would make Bangladeshi farmers permanently dependent on them for seeds. Eco-feminists are also committed not to sacrifice their seed and food sovereignty for corporate control and profits, as women are primary food-growers and food-givers claim that, alternative lies in women's hands and minds and demands a paradigm shift from monocultures to diversity and from chemicals to organic. Previously there were no special laws regulating biotechnology, biosafety and GMOs in Bangladesh even though the country ratified the Cartagena Protocol on biosafety (makes provisions to regulate, manage or control risks associated with transfer, handling and use of GMOs/LMOs and products thereof that may have adverse effects on conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity). In 2012 Government has passed The Bio-Safety Rule, in exercising rules making power delegated under Section 20 of the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act, 1995. With passing this Rule, GMOs are no more unregulated in Bangladesh. Rule no. 3 imposes restrictions on import and export of GMOs as 'no person or institution can import, export, buy, sell or commercially use the Genetically Modified Organism and products thereof, without prior permission from the Ministry of Environment and Forest'. This Rules also provides for mandatory provision for identification or labeling of GMOs in rule 5 as 'any box or cover, which carries Genetically Modified Organism or Products thereof, shall have detail identification or labeling on it relating to the nature of Genetically Modified Organism or products thereof, which is additional provision, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law regarding this'. This Rules criminalised adverse impacts of GMOs as 'environmental pollution and damaging the ecosystem' in the following words 'if any environmental pollution is created or ecosystem is damaged by the Genetically Modified Organism or Products thereof, the producer institution, exporter, importer, store keeper, supplier and retailer, all shall be liable for the offence of environmental pollution or ecosystem damage, unless he/they proves that he/they does not have direct involvement with such pollution or damage' (rule 9). In respect of biosafety related to GMOs, Bangladesh has also developed a Bio-safety Guideline in 2007, which is endorsed by the Bio-safety Rules. The Guidelines of 2007 formed the basis of the regulatory framework of monitoring and enforcement processes in respect to biosafety in Bangladesh and it also structured the institutional frameworks. This Guideline provides different biosafety Committees and their composition, powers, functions and responsibilities. Biosafety guidelines are applicable to all research and development activities of modern biotechnology conducted in laboratories of the government research institutes, state enterprises, universities, international organisations located in Bangladesh, private companies or non-governmental organisations etc. In accordance with the mandate of National Bio-Safety Framework- 2007, the Government of Bangladesh is now framing a National Bio-safety Policy and a GMO Enforcement Manual. As regards the laws of Bangladesh non-compliance is the main problem. These legal provisions should be monitored properly and enforced strictly, so that no one can take advantage of the weak regulatory mechanism of biosafety in Bangladesh.

Rajuk instead should support apartment housing and develop urban facilities so that private individuals can build their own houses, said Prof Aktar Hossain Chowdhury, deputy leader of the consultants' team for the proposed 20-year master plan, at a national seminar at Rajuk Bhaban yesterday. With the existing master plan mostly unimplemented and its term expiring this year, Rajuk has embarked on drawing up a new one, the Dhaka Structure Plan 2016-2035, under the \"City Region Development\" project funded by the Asian Development Bank and Bangladesh's government.   Rajuk organised a two-day national seminar on the draft structure plan on its premises seeking opinions of relevant experts and professionals.   The plan proposes protection of flood flow zones, canals, rivers, ponds and flood water retention areas through land acquisition and proper demarcation to save surface water against contamination, help storm drainage, and ground water percolation, said Chowdhury, while making a presentation. The proposed plan outlines long-term development of the city's transportation, housing and utility services, land use, conservation of floodplains, water retention areas, farmland, open spaces, industrialisation, disaster management, heritage and culture. It has divided an updated 1,624 sq km area into six regions.          The plan recommends construction of three ring roads around Dhaka city, conservation of open spaces and heritage properties, introduction of aesthetic urban designing in development, advanced acquisition of land for future road construction.       Narayanganj city Mayor Dr Selina Hayat Ivy, however, expressed frustration saying the proposed plan, foiling the existing one, had a deliberate attempt to legalise the acts of land grabbers, who had illegally filled extensive conservable floodplains, canals and retention areas resulting in recurrent urban flooding in Dhaka city.  \"How long will we continue making urban plans and leave them unimplemented?\" she said, adding that local government bodies like city corporations must be empowered to help implement the urban master plan. Real estate developers have filled wetlands all around leaving Dhaka's storm drainage system clogged, said Dhaka South City Corporation Mayor Mohammad Sayeed Khokon. Mayor of Dhaka's north Annisul Huq said, \"A new master plan is being made leaving the existing one unimplemented, and we don't know what changes and improvements are being made.\"         The area the plan covers includes four city corporations, five municipalities and 70 Union Parishads of Dhaka, Narayanganj and Gazipur districts with over 15 million people.  The population is projected to increase to 26 million by 2035 in the proposed plan.    Gazipur constitutes one-fifth of the master plan area, yet local public representatives were not engaged in the plan preparation process, ignoring local waste management, drainage and disaster management, said Asadur Rahman Kiron, mayor in charge of Gazipur City Corporation. Housing Minister Mosharraf Hossain said the Detailed Area Plan (DAP) of the existing master plan was drawn up sitting at home and without going to the field. \"Now we have to prepare a pragmatic DAP,\" he said.    The present DAP kept 405 sq km of 1,528 sq km area as conservable floodplains, water retention areas, canals, lakes and rivers together, and 330 sq km as agricultural land. It suggested reclamation of over 2,500 acres of flood flow zones and agricultural land from illegal realtors, relocation of 3,000 factories and scrapping of 16 development projects. None of the suggestions have been acted upon. Previous Rajuk high officials told The Daily Star time and again that they could not implement the vital suggestions of DAP as the seven-minister cabinet committee for DAP review did not give them directives. Meanwhile, in a letter to relevant authorities, three professional and environmental bodies, the Bangladesh Institute of Planners (BIP), Institute of Architects Bangladesh and Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon, said they were not invited as professional groups in making the new master plan. Md Akter Mahmud, general secretary of BIP, said the authorities had not involved them in any stage of the plan preparation process.  Khondaker M Ansar Hossain, an urban planner, who was coordinator of consultants on the existing DAP, said, \"The proposed draft structure plan was sent to us just a couple of days back. How can we make any contribution?\" Prof Ishrat Islam, head of Buet's urban and regional planning department, said, \"Rajuk chose such a way and process that we did not have the chance to make a professional contribution to the proposed plan.\"  Prof Jamilur Reza Choudhury, who headed the review committee on the current DAP, is in no way involved with the process of the proposed plan, nor was he provided with a copy of the draft plan.  Two South Korean consulting firms SAMAN Corporation and Han-A Urban Research Institute and two local firms Sheltech Pvt Ltd and DevConsultants Ltd are preparing the structure plan."

The country has lost over 1,800 sq km lands due to erosion of Ganga, Jamuna and Padma rivers in last three decades; he stated adding that the government successfully recovered 1,036 sqkm of land through dredging and constructin embankments in the Jamuna and Meghna River. Tk 1,405 crore has been estimated to carry out excavation of 3,000 km. Besides, 5,850 km embankments will be repaired or reconstructed under the same project, the minister said. The government will dredge all rivers of the country and canals once the projects are approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council. The Water Resources Minister said the project \"River bank protection in Bangladesh\" is aimed to protect river banks and towns across the country. The estimated budget for the project is Tk 1493 crore. On the impact of river erosion, Anisul informed the House that over 2,400 km of river banks are threatened with erosion every year. The minister said rate of intensity of river erosion has come down to 60 Sq km from 100 Sq km per year due to river training measure. A project titled \"Flood and river bank erosion risk management investment programme\" involving Tk 828.65 crore is underway for permanent solution of erosion of Padma, Ganga and Jamuna River. On the setting up the Ganga Barrage, Anisul said drawing up detailed design of the barrage has been completed as per the recommendation of feasibility study of the project. A Preliminary Development Project Proposal of Ganga Barage Project was sent to the Economic Relations Division to get participation of development partners and DPP of the project is under consideration of the Planning Commission.

      "text": "If you are learning to drive in Dhaka, do not waste time reading about traffic rules. Dhaka has its own unique unspoken rules for its streets. Learning written rules or driving properly will not save you from getting hit by someone else or hitting something while driving. Here are some incomplete rules: First, red means go, green means stop. Orange means nothing. Please do not follow the signal lights to risk your dear life. To understand when to cross an intersection, the safest way is to follow any bus. Buses and minibuses set the rule. Second, use the footpaths if you are riding a bike (optionally car). Using the footpaths for just walking is a sheer waste of space, so feel free. If you are a pedestrian, please use the road to walk at any direction you like. If you are lucky, some bus will hit you and send you to your destination faster than light. Third, do not stop your motorcycle or car below the window of any bus or minibus. If you are compelled to stop by a bus, say at a traffic signal, keep an umbrella handy. Invariably, there will be a few bus passengers who'd like to throw up their delicacies through the window and drench you/your vehicle. In case you are a medical student in such a situation: you can challenge yourself to determine when the food was taken before being thrown up by judging how much of it had been digested and what he/she had eaten. Fourth, watch out for minibuses and motorcycles. The minibuses are out to kill you and the motorcycles are dying to get smashed by your car. Fifth, you can always put the motorcyclists at fault when you have an accident with them. Even when you are at fault, you will find bigger faults with them like: his cellphone is sticking out of his helmet by his ear, meaning he was talking while riding; he came from the wrong direction through a red light; half of his bike is still on the footpath over which he was taking a shortcut; the bike rider is not a human being; his bike has no brakes, lights, fuel or even an engine etc. Sixth, if you are a motorcyclist, you are the biggest winner next to a minibus driver in this city. No law, natural or manmade, is applicable for you. As long as you are driving a motorbike, you can defy gravity, you can fly and you can even date Marilyn Monroe by reviving her from the grave. But watch out for those minibuses. Seventh, if you are a bus driver -- you are the ultimate Guru; the king of kings and your bus is the lord of the ring. You set the rule. You decide where to stop your bus to pick or drop a passenger. You decide who lives or who dies on the streets of Dhaka. You can stop one million other vehicles behind you when you wish to stop your vehicle sideways. Don't be afraid of the traffic police, because Shipping Minister Shajahan Khan will personally protect you. Finally, watch out for jaywalkers. Unlike other city streets of the world where young punks indulge in street racing using sports cars, Dhaka hosts across-street racing using jaywalkers (punks of all ages and genders). They race just below foot bridges or underpasses and if you, stuck by a flood of jaywalkers at a crossing where you waited for a signal for 10 minutes, honk at them, they will snap back at you threateningly waving whatever they are carrying with them. Please be sympathetic towards the traffic police. I once asked a traffic police why he did not say anything to a driver who had just disobeyed his signal and gone in the wrong way, his reply was, \"I am afraid! You never know who he is.\" Yes, the final word is -- in Dhaka, everyone except you, is someone above the law."

      "text": "Unplanned urban development and housing settlement on filled up marshland and low-lying flood flow zones have made the capital highly vulnerable to earthquake hazards, said leading seismic experts. They feared an earthquake above 7 magnitude on the Richter scale would result in colossal loss of life and properties in the city. \"A major earthquake is at the door of Bangladesh ... the country's geological position, tectonic setup and seismic historical facts are indicative of such an impending disaster,\" said Prof Syed Humayun Akhter, chairman of the geology department at Dhaka University and a noted seismologist.   \"So, what we urgently need are public awareness and the government's preparedness,\" he said. When two tectonic plates get locked with each other, energy accumulates inside the earth for over hundreds of years. The energy is released through the borderline or fault line of the tectonic plates resulting in earthquake, added the DU teacher.  Bangladesh lies close to three tectonic plates, including the Indian plate to the west and south west, Tibet sub-plate to the north and Burmese sub-plate to the east. The plates have converging or transverse movements, said Prof Akhter.     \"More importantly, borderline of the Indian plate and Burmese sub-plate runs across Bangladesh territory and the strain energy is building up along the plate boundary that will result in an earthquake,\" he noted. That aside, there are active fault lines of the plates like Modhupur and a fault line stretching from Mymensingh to Faridpur across Dhaka and Dauki fault line along the foot of Shilong plateau in Bangladesh-Meghalaya border.        There are also the main boundary thrust of Indian plate and Eurasia plate at the foot of the Himalaya to the north of Bangladesh, Chittagong-Arakan plate boundary to the east, Sylhet-Assam plate boundary fault to the north-east of Dhaka, Kaladan fault of Burma plate in Mizoram and Burma. \"These are all considered potential sources of major and great earthquakes with the magnitude above 7 on the Richter scale,\" mentioned Prof Akhter. Over the last four centuries, a 7 magnitude Modhupur earthquake in 1885 and the 1897 great Indian earthquake with 8.7 magnitude in Assam rocked and damaged Bangladesh. The Dauki great earthquake in 1787 changed the course of the Brahmaputra, he said. The Sylhet-Assam fault triggered a 7.6 magnitude earthquake in 1918 while Srimangal experienced a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in 1868, he said, adding that the 8.5 magnitude earthquake along the Chittagong-Arakan plate boundary in 1762 raised the Saint Martin's Island by two and a half metres, making it habitable.    Energy has been building up at all the above said borderlines and faults and it would be released causing an earthquake, said the expert. According to him, the 7.8 magnitude Pokhara earthquake in Nepal on April 25 is a recurrence after 80 years. It has so far claimed over 7,800 lives and ruined hundreds of structures.    VULNERABILITY ASM Maksud Kamal, chairman of the department of disaster science and management at Dhaka University, said over 1.40 lakh one to four-storey masonry buildings (built without iron rods) out of around four lakh buildings in 300 sqkm area of Dhaka city might collapse in the event of an 7.5 magnitude earthquake within the Bangladesh territory. Besides, at least 80,000 buildings with a soft storey (which is less stiff) or the ground floor vacant for car parking are equally vulnerable, he added, citing the findings of the Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme (CDMP). The over-hanging buildings with heavier top floors than the bottom would collapse first, said Maksud, who led the CDMP earthquake technical team.     \"The structures built on the earth-filled low-lying marshland stand extremely vulnerable to earthquakes, as the ground shaking wave duration is longer in marshland than what it is in strong red soil,\" he noted. Of the 300 square-kilometre area of the core Dhaka city, 65 percent is of soft soil. Any 7.5 magnitude earthquake along the 60km-long Modhupur fault line or 240km-long Dauki fault line, both within Bangladesh territory, would result in such a havoc.       Mehedi Ahmed Ansary, professor of civil engineering at Buet and the founding general secretary of Bangladesh Earthquake Society, echoed the views of Prof Akhter. Citing examples of building collapses like Rana Plaza, Phoenix and Spectrum without an earthquake, Mehedi warned about the dangers of constructing buildings without regulatory oversight and flouting the National Building Code. Those three disasters exposed the country's inability to tackle a single building collapse. He said the Assam earthquake in 1897, with the epicentre 250km off Dhaka, had killed 1,542 people in Dhaka, which had a population of just 90,000 back then, and razed half the masonry structures across the 20 sqkm city. The human catastrophe in the event of a major earthquake is foreseeable with the population now 100 times bigger and the city area expanded manifold due to an unplanned growth. The Bashundhara Housing Project, Pallabi and Goran schemes of Eastern Housing, Niketan housing, Baridhara DOHS, Aftabnagar housing, Jolshiri housing for the army and settlements on the Buriganga flood plains were all made by filling low-lying marshland and flood flow zones. This was done without any scientific oversight, making the structures there potentially vulnerable to earthquakes, he said. Such filling is going on a massive scale in the 1,528 sqkm area of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha. Brig Gen Ali Ahmed Khan, director general of Fire Service and Civil Defence, said gas explosion, fire from electricity and water contamination following an earthquake would take the situation out of their control. \"The roads may be inaccessible with rubble of collapsed buildings. The chemical warehouses and factories in residential areas might cause infernos.... The first aid medical teams may not be able to reach the victims,\" he mentioned.      There is no designated water reservoir in Dhaka city to fight any major fire, Khan pointed out.  PREPAREDNESS  The fire service DG said there are 30,000 trained volunteers, 200 trained officials and 57 sets of rescue and search equipment, like cutting tools and drilling hammers. The army has some heavy equipment like concrete breakers and excavators. \"But such preparedness is extremely inadequate to manage the devastation of a major earthquake,\" he added. Prof Maksud Kamal said of the 2,300km roads in 127 sqkm city corporations area, only 300km are accessible by fire service rescue vehicles and heavy equipment. Though a contingency plan involving 13 government organisations is in place for post-earthquake disaster management, it lacks coordination and preparedness, he noted. Also, there is no trained manpower to operate all the available equipment.  The experts stressed the need for launching a massive campaign to make people aware of simple life saving tips during an earthquake."

      "text": "As the blistering humid summer finally takes a leave, Dhaka happily welcomes the festive winter season. Where in many other countries winters are spent draped in dull dreary colours, sloshing through inches of snow and hoping this god forsaken season ends soon, here in tropical Bangladesh winter begins with festivities of 'Nobanno'; a harvest celebration usually celebrated with food, dance and music. Not to mention, Bangladeshi winters also mean weddings, steaming plates of biriyani drenched in ghee with soft potatoes, the cozy sweaters gathering dust and the smell of naphthalene balls in your cupboard, badminton games in your neighbourhood, warm warm blankets, monkey caps and of course the piece de resistance of winter--Pithas. The harvest of rice is celebrated with Nobanno utshab and is a time of celebration in rural areas. Farmers harvest new rice, houses smell of the rice being husked, sounds of 'dhak dhak dhak' can be heard in each courtyard as fresh rice is being broken down into powder in a 'dheki'--a tool akin to the mortar and pestle but on a much larger scale. It is used to remove the husks of rice and also to pound rice into powder. Coupled with 'Nobanno' winters also come with \"Khejur er rosh,\" or date juice, which is the sweet sap extracted from the soft trunk of the top-most part of the date tree. Around the rural areas, it is a common sight in winter--a clay pot attached to the top of date trees collecting the extract overnight and dismantled in the early morning. The juice can be consumed fresh and also turned into molasses and jaggery--a key ingredient in pithas. Bhapa Pitha: This is a winter favourite, made from roughly pounded rice mixed with fresh coconut shavings and stuffed with date palm jaggery. It is usually made into tiny discs of goodness, steamed and eaten piping hot. When made right, it is soft and fluffy and rewards you with bites of creamy coconut oozing with molten jaggery in each bite. Bhapa pithas can be found on most streets in Dhaka along with pitha ghar in Bailey road. It of course tastes best when cooked over earthen stoves crackling and spitting fire, with your grandmother keeping a hawks eye on the preparation and the winter chill hanging low over the trees in your village home. Chitoi Pitha: Another classic, the chitoi and bhapa go hand in hand. Here the rice powder is made into a runny paste with a little salt to taste and cooked in either clay pots or iron pots over medium to high heat. It is similar to a pancake minus the flip. Chitoi is eaten with a variety of condiments: Dry fish paste (Shutki bhorta), mustard paste (Shorshe bhorta), chilli paste (Kacha Morich bhorta), molasses and can also be eaten with duck curry. The chitoi is an empty canvas and you can unleash your culinary expertise pairing it with all sorts of food items. The chitoi can also be turned into dudh chitoi. Soaked in milk sweetened with date molasses topped with coconut shavings, Dudh chitoi makes for a wonderful deshi dessert. Dudh Puli:\n Small pockets of coconut filled rice cakes which is then boiled in milk that is separately flavoured with cardamom, bay leaf, cinnamon, sweetened with date palm molasses or jaggery along with coconut shavings. This is a sweet lover's heaven and is a burst of flavors in your mouth. Small rice pockets filled with fried coconut in a sea of sweet milk will flood your mouth in each bite.   Tel er Pitha: A runny mixture of powdered rice flour sweetened with date palm jaggery and fried in hot oil will give you the scrumptious tel-er-pitha. Each bite is a beautiful sweet and sticky melody. Crunchy on the outside, warm and sticky soft on the inside, tel-er-pitha is for those winter evenings spent hanging out with family complete with warm cups of sugary tea.  Patishapta: Mera Pitha/Choi Pitha:\n These are steamed or boiled rice balls but made in different shapes in different areas. In the Sylhet region, they are called choi pitha and they are eaten with steaming duck curry, spicy red hot beef curry and different kinds of bhorta. They can be kept for a few days and when a little old they are diced and fried in oil along with scrambled eggs and slit green chilies. In Bikrampur, Noakhali, Comilla they are called Mera pitha and is usually eaten with date palm molasses. Nakshipitha: These are crispy rice cakes made with rice flour dough that is kneaded and then given various shapes to be designed with intricate 'naksha' inspired with motifs from everyday life such as leaves, flowers and waves. Nakshipitha is deep fried in oil and soaked in a syrupy mixture of date palm molasses. The intricate designs on the pitha were traditionally made using the thorn of the date palm tree.Quintessential Bangladeshi winters would be incomplete without Pithas and pitha making is usually a communal affair where young and old of the family get together and partake in the various stages involved in making these delicacies. Ingrained into our culture, pithas hold a special place in the Bangalee's heart and winters are made all the more special by them."

The flash flood has left some 40,000 people without shelter. The road links between the district and other parts of the country remain cut for the last three days. Many victims said they were suffering from shortage of food and drinking water and were yet to receive relief supplies. Hundreds of people living on hill slopes in Moulvibazar and Khagrachhari were passing their days in fear of landslides due to incessant rain. Within half an hour, members of Bangladesh Army, Border Guard Bangladesh, fire brigade and police launched a search for victims. Critically injured Jhunu Begum, 28, and her six-year-old daughter Neha were rescued around 4:00am. The two died on the way to a hospital. The bodies of Shah Alam, 50, his wife Rokeya Begum, 36, and their niece Rita Akhter, 21, were found around 1:00pm. Four others were rescued alive from under the mud before the search operation ended around 3:00pm. Victim Nuru Nabi said locals hurried to the spot and rescued him. Petan Ali, leader of the Cox's Bazar Municipality unit Awami League, said his house was also hit by the landslide, but his family members were safe. Acting deputy commissioner of Cox's Bazar Anupam Saha said they launched an awareness campaign in the district to warn people about the dangers of living on hill slopes. The bodies of the five victims were handed over to their relatives in the evening. Meanwhile, Anwar Hossain, 55, of Surazpur-Manikpur union and Rokeya Begum, 29, of Khutakhali union in Chakaria upazila of Cox's Bazar drowned in flood water on Sunday night, said the upazila nirbahi officer. Earlier on June 27, five people died in landslides in different upazilas of the district. There were landslides in two hills in Chittagong city's GEC and Surson Road areas yesterday due to heavy rains, but no casualties were reported. Mansurur Rahman, district rehabilitation officer in Bandarban, said they distributed 35 tonnes of rice and Tk 70,000 among the flood victims. The Barisal port authorities asked all small and medium-sized vessels to suspend operations until further notice due to rough weather. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority suspended operations of its 36 launches on 22 routes from Barisal. However, trips of Dhaka-bound triple-deck launches were not cancelled till 5:00pm yesterday. Our correspondents from Cox's Bazar, Barisal, Chittagong, Bandarban, Khagrachhari and Moulvibazar contributed to this report."

      "text": "The country's fish production has nearly doubled over the last decade--thanks to popularity of fish farming. According to data of Bangladesh Department of Fisheries, farmed fish production was 2 million tonnes in 2013-14. This was only 0.8 million tonnes back in 2001-02. Consequently, the overall fish production increased spectacularly by around 88 percent during this period. This is great news for the nation as fish accounts for about 56 percent of Bangladesh's intake of animal protein. According to fisheries department, the country produced about 3.5 million tonnes of fish in the 2013-14. Of this, 2.9 million tonnes came from farms and catches from various Inland water sources, and 0.6 million tonnes were from the sea. A decade back the total fish production stood at 1.9 million tonnes--majority of it came from various inland water sources. This rise in fish culture is due to increase in high quality fish feed and seed production, and widespread induced breeding technology, the department says. Another reason that boosted fish production is the Jatka Conservation project that imposed a ban on Hilsa fishing. The most dominant source of fresh water fish in the country is the several thousand ponds in the villages, comprising of about 0.4 million hectare area that produce half of the Inland water fish. One quarter fish comes from flood plains.\n Water area for Inland fisheries comprises of approximately 4.7 million hectares across the country. Dhaka division tops fish production with claiming 28 percent of the stake; followed by Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi ranging between 13 percent and 20 percent. Rangpur contributes the least with just 5 percent production.  As per the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), global fish production was 158 million tonnes in 2012 and per capita fish consumption was 19.2 kg. Annual consumption of fish and fish products in Bangladesh was 12 kg/per person in 2010, with Chittagong having highest annual consumption of about 17 kg/per person. In Bangladesh, about three fourth of consumed fish are fresh water fish, among which Pangas, Rui, and Tilapi tops our chart. Pangas farming has become an established agro-processing industry in the country over the last decade. Pangas is most easy to produce due to its short culture-cycle, high growth rate and unselective feeding habit. It also has good resistance to diseases. These characteristics are somewhat also present in Tilapia. Export of fish and fish products increased by 86 percent from 2001-02 and reached 77,000 tonnes in 2013-14. Although, the country's exports reached its peak of about 96,000 tonnes in the fiscal year 2010-11, it declined in the recent years. One of the reasons behind the decline can be ascribed to the ban on Hilsa export, set to ensure the country was not deprived of the delicacy. According to the latest FAO report, The state of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2014, Bangladesh continues to be the fourth largest fish producer in the world for Inland waters fish capture.  FAO predicts Bangladesh to be the first of the four countries, followed by Thailand, India, and China, to experience the highest growth rate in terms of fish production by the year 2022."

Relatives of Md Russel, 27, found him hanging from a ceiling fan while his wife Sadia Akhter Iffat, 18, was lying dead in a bed, with her throat slit. Russel supplied chemicals to tanneries in the area. Talking to The Daily Star, Russel's mother Saleha Begum said the couple got married about 14 months ago, but were unhappy. They rented the apartment on the second flood of the three-storey building on Gazmahal Road four months ago, but Saleha soon left her husband. Russel's father-in-law had given him about Tk3 lakh to start a business. Saleha's father Sirajul Islam said Russel called up his daughter yesterday to take back the money. When Saleha along with her elder sister went there, Russel took Saleha in and locked the main door of the apartment from inside. As none of the two opened the door for a while, their family members broke open the door around 7:45pm and found the two dead. Rejaul Karim, assistant commissioner (Dhanmondi zone) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, said they were probing the deaths. Law enforcers recovered a knife from the crime scene, he added."

You take selfies of yourself, and you take group selfies with a bunch of people in it (also known as groupie). From my months of selfie experience, I've come to a set of norms you should maintain while taking selfies. 1. Manage to get everyone in the picture. Don't just focus on yourself, and don't even intentionally leave out the people you dislike. Just don't. If you are the selfie-taker, it is your responsibility to accommodate everybody in the screen. Take multiple shots if needed. If your hands aren't long enough, ask someone else to do the honour. Otherwise, get a selfie stick. 2. If you are taking a selfie with two or three people but there are more of your pals around, don't forget to invite them to join in. Otherwise, take separate selfies with them. In any case, do ensure that nobody feels left out; we don't want anybody going home with a heavy heart, do we? 3. One recurring problem of the countless selfies we take with people is that the pictures get lost in the bottomless abyss of your phone's gallery. As a selfie maestro, your job is to upload the pictures promptly and tag your friends, unless they don't want to be tagged.  Believe me, otherwise you'll be subject to much nagging, and in some cases, said friends may even stop talking to you.  4. The above example of friends disowning you also stands true for when you upload only the selfies where you look good. Nobody wants to look bad in pictures. So, you can't just upload a bad picture of your friend and get away with it, even if you are looking at your best. Crop yourself and upload separately if need be, but don't be that narcissistic selfie-addict who cares not about others.   5. Develop a sense of time and space of taking a selfie. Needless to say, funerals or hospitals aren't the best location for selfies. Neither are overnight jail cells, if you ever get arrested. Add exam halls to that list, but hey, who am I to judge if your invigilator is cool with that? Similarly, you can't just break up with your not-so-better half, and attempt to take a selfie while they are crying. That is highly unethical and might be injurious to your health.  6. In a selfie featuring you alone, you are allowed to go berserk, so long as you maintain ample decency, as it goes up on Facebook. Oh, and #putting #hashtag #in #every #word #is #just #annoying, and won't really get you all the likes you are fishing for. It's best if you don't flood everyone's newsfeed with a bunch of hashtags that don't make sense. Use your hashtags smartly, efficiently and sparingly.  In order to ace the art of selfies, you need practice. But to become a maestro loved by all, you need to follow the rules. Keep clicking, y'all!  Arman R.

It's the birthday of the late, great Humayun Ahmed, and every year on this day, I (and a few other journalists) would go to Dokhin Hawa, his Dhanmondi residence, to convey birthday greetings. Humayun sir, a jolly, fun-loving man, would spend time with us and discuss about a wide array of topics. On one such occasion, I asked him about his birthday plans? Humayun Ahmed laughed and said \"Birthday means a year has gone by from life. So there is no reason to be excited. Life is traveling towards its end.\" On our way back, he gave us some books. On one of his birthdays, I wanted to give him a special gift, so I found a photo my photographer took at Nuhash Polli, capturing a candid moment of the wordsmith taking a photo of his son Nishad. So I framed that photo and gave it to him on his birthday, and he was very happy. When I went to see him at Nuhash Polli the last time he returned from the US from his cancer treatment, I found that photo hanging on a wall in his living room, next to some other personal favourite photos. On his last birthday, publisher Mazharul of Annya Publication House threw a party on the occasion. We all went to his house for lunch. After the meal, he said \"My birthday is not in my control anymore; it belongs to my publishers.\"   That birthday of his remains an unforgettable one for me. At that time, he was busy shooting for the film \"Ghetuputhro Komola\". I asked him what he had got as a gift from his wife. He laughed and said \"Shaon sang a song for me last night. That is my big gift this year.\" On his birthday, a book fair of only his books was held in Sahbagh's Public Library. His book \"Kath-pencil\" was published that year. I stood in line to buy the book and then asked for his autograph. I was also buying his novel \"Moddhanno\". \"Have you read the first part?\" he asked. I told him I did. He gave me autograph on the book and said I shouldn't pay for it. That was the last gift from him, and it is one of my most precious possessions. His birthday is here again, but he is no more. Stay well wherever you are, my favourite wordsmith."

      "text": "Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority has started implementing the plan to set up an exclusive tourism park at Sabrang in Teknaf, but a lack of infrastructure and the rehabilitation of farmers remain the major challenges. Since the site is vulnerable to flood and storm surges, the developer or authorities will have to bear high expenses for embankments and landfills, according to a pre-feasibility study report. A lack of urban infrastructure, such as telecom, water and power supplies and water treatment systems, will be one of the major challenges to setting up the tourism park, the report said. As about 44 percent of economic activities in the locality depend on farming, the rehabilitation of farmers will be a major concern. South Korean DOHWA Engineering Company conducted a pre-feasibility study that was presented at a workshop on \"stakeholder consultation on interim report of pre-feasibility study of Sabrang tourism park and conceptual planning of Anowara-2 economic zone\" at BEZA headquarters in Dhaka recently. \"The site is part of the longest beach in the world. It is close to Saint Martin's island,\" according to the report, which was presented by Lee Sang-hyun, senior urban designer of DOHWA. A new coastal road can be a direct route from an upgraded airport, the report added. BEZA is setting up the tourism park on about 1,027 acres of land at Sabrang, which will create employment opportunities for about 25,000 people. \"It will be the first of its kind in Bangladesh and help attract not only tourists, but also investment from both home and abroad,\" Paban Chowdhury, executive chairman of Beza, told The Daily Star. There are many tourism sites in the country, but none of those has modern amusement facilities, he said. \"The Sabrang tourism park will be equipped with amusement facilities as well as accommodations meeting global standards.\" Ocean-park, golf course, hotels and resorts, duty-free shopping mall, food courts, souvenir shops, hospital, theatres, helipad, business centres, 3D aquarium and prayer's hall will be set up in the zone, according to the report. Tourists will also be able to take part in surfing, bungee jumping, buggy car driving, scuba diving and hang gliding. Some eco-tourism facilities such as trekking and cycling and traditional cultural events such as dance performance and Bangladeshi cuisine will also be available. The park will boost tourism and reduce the country's dependence on the apparel sector for export earnings, the report said. Bangladesh's tourism industry amounted to around $3.7 billion or 4.1 percent of GDP in 2014, and it is forecasted to increase to about $15 billion or 4.4 percent respectively in 2025, the report added. The travel and tourism sector yielded about 1.98 million jobs including indirect employment, accounting for about 3.6 percent of total employment. The sector's total contribution to employment generation is also expected to reach 2.49 million in 2025, accounting for about 3.6 percent of total employment. The sector recorded about $752 million in investment till 2014 that may stand at approximately $1.6 billion in 2025, according to the report. The tourism park is one of the four economic zones that BEZA is setting up under the public sector. The three other public economic zones are: Mirsarai Economic Zone in Chittagong, Mongla Economic Zone in Bagerhat and Srihatta Economic Zone in Moulvibazar. Under the private sector, BEZA awarded a final licence to Meghna Group of Industries last month for setting up Meghna Economic Zone in Narayanganj. The authority also awarded prequalification licences to nine local private companies to set up 10 other economic zones -- one each to AK Khan and Company, Abdul Monem Ltd, Meghna Group, Bay Group, Aman Group, Maisha Group, United Group, Unique Group and two to Bashundhara Group. BEZA plans to develop 100 economic zones by 2030 on 75,000 acres to create jobs for one crore people and produce goods and services worth $40 billion."

      "text": "Bangladesh is moving ahead with a project to formulate the Delta Plan 2100. Apparently, this is a good idea. After all, Bangladesh is primarily a delta, and a long term plan for its land and water use may well be called \"Delta Plan 2100\" to emphasise its long term nature. However, there are many questions about the way this plan is being formulated. Two important questions: after forty-five years of independence and sixty years of water development experience why does Bangladesh need a delta plan formulation process that is heavily dependent on foreign advice and financing? Second, is the Dutch experience most relevant for formulation of the delta plan for Bangladesh? We consider below these two questions very briefly. With respect to the first question, it may be noted that Bangladesh already has the disappointing experience of foreign-led water development strategy. In the fifties, a commission led by Mr. Krug of US Army Corps of Engineers was invited to Bangladesh to advice on its water development strategy. Following that commission's report, in the early sixties the International Engineering Co. (IEC) prepared a master plan, containing a list of twenty-seven projects. The water development efforts of the country for the next six decades have basically been directed toward implementation of the projects of that master plan. The basic philosophy behind the Krug Commission's report and the Master Plan has been the \"Cordon Approach\" to rivers, according to which the floodplains and tidal plains are to be cordoned off from surrounding rivers by constructing uninterrupted embankments. This philosophy ignores the fundamental fact that in a delta the floodplains (also the tidal plains) are organically connected with the river channels, so that these two cannot be separated without causing harm to both. Foreign consultants who dominated the Krug commission and IEC were mostly from countries in which deltas are not that important (such as in the United States), so that they did not quite understand the reality of a delta. The ill effects of the Cordon approach are now everywhere to see. It has led to promotion of below-flood-level settlement, aggradation of river bed, subsidence of flood and tidal plains, deterioration of the water bodies inside the floodplains, disruption of open capture fisheries, diminution of waterways, reduced recharge of groundwater table, and most importantly ubiquitous waterlogging. The Dhaka-Narayanganj-Demra (DND) project - the showcase of the Cordon approach - provides an example of these effects. Meanwhile, the promised surface water irrigation potential of the Cordon projects generally failed to materialize, and expansion of irrigation was almost completely taken over by tube-well irrigation, for which Cordons were mostly unnecessary, if not a hindrance. (For details, see the author's book Let the Delta Be a Delta!) Given this sorry experience why again turn to foreign assistance for formulating the delta plan of Bangladesh? It may be said that while the Krug Commission and the Master Plan were dominated by experts who had less knowledge about deltas, the current Delta Plan is formulated with technical assistance and financing of the Dutch, who have better knowledge of delta, because their country - the Netherlands - is also primarily a delta formed by the Rhine River and its distributaries. This brings us to the second question above, namely how appropriate is the Dutch experience for Bangladesh's delta plan? Unfortunately, the answer to this question is: \"not much.\" This is because of the following. Not all deltas are the same, and the conditions of the Rhine delta are entirely different from those of Bangladesh delta. The annual volume of the Rhine flow (75 cubic kilometre) is only 7.2 percent of the combined flow of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra (1032 cubic kilometre). If the Meghna flow is included, this ratio will likely be less than five percent. Thus, there is no comparison between the volumes of flows of the rivers of these two deltas. Second, there is a striking difference in the seasonality of the river flows in the two deltas. The figure below shows that most of the \"rainfall\" in Bangladesh is concentrated in the four months (June-September). By contrast, the rainfall in the Netherlands is almost evenly distributed across the all months of the year. The difference in seasonality in \"river flows\" will be greater than in rainfall, because the rivers carry not only the rainfall within Bangladesh but also of the entire catchment area of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Rivers, 92.6 percent of which lies outside Bangladesh. As a result of the low volume and absence of seasonality, the Dutch could resort to the Cordon approach to their rivers. That is why, during the FAP debate in the wake of the 1988 flood, the Dutch experts supported the dangerous French proposal of double-embanking all major rivers of Bangladesh. Clearly, the Dutch are yet to understand that what is needed in Bangladesh is the \"Open approach\" to rivers that preserves, extends, and makes the best use of the organic connection between the river channels and floodplains. In parentheses, it may be noted that the Dutch are realising belatedly the shortcomings of the Cordon approach and the benefits of the Open approach. They have recently taken up, what is popularly known as the \"Room for Rivers\" project, under which parts of floodplain are now opened up for river overflows. Apart from water volume and seasonality, another important difference between the Rhine delta and Bengal delta is in the amount of sediment. Partly because the Himalayas are a younger mountain range than the Alps, the rivers bring to Bangladesh about 1.5 to 2.0 billion tonnes of sediment annually. By comparison, the annual amount of sediment brought down by the Rhine is 2.7 million tonnes only (less than a day's amount in Bangladesh). There is therefore no vigorous land accretion process in the Rhine delta. Hence, the Dutch had to resort to reclamation of land from under the sea level, so that now about 28 percent of the area of the Netherlands is below the sea-level, containing about one-fifth of the population. The danger of this situation is getting worse with the rising sea level caused by global warming. By contrast, vigorous delta formation has led to net accretion of 1,882 hectares of land annually between 1973 and 2000 in Bangladesh. Thus Bangladesh does not need to replicate the Dutch experience of reclamation of land from under the sea-level. Bangladesh is fortunate to have natural extension of land above the sea level. In view of the above, it is hardly reassuring that the current Delta Plan is being prepared under the Dutch guidance. Moreover, the recent Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by Bangladesh, the Dutch and the World Bank suggest that the whole project is again likely to be dominated by a similar cast of experts as was the case with the Krug commission and IEC Master Plan. The Bangladesh Delta Plan should be prepared under Bangladesh finance and leadership of Bangladeshi experts. If Bangladesh can finance Padma Bridge from its own resources, it can very well find the relatively small amount necessary to prepare the Delta Plan. Also, Bangladesh now has enough national expertise to analyse closely its vast experience of water development and formulate a delta plan that conforms to the indigenous intricacies of land, water, people, history, and culture. More importantly, formulation of the delta plan should not be viewed as the task of a closed group of \"experts\". It has to be a process of open public dialogue, in which the common people can participate on an equal footing with others. The writer is Global Coordinator, Bangladesh Environment Network (BEN).

      "authors": "\nWASIM BIN HABIB and TUHIN SHUBHRA ADHIKARY\n",
      "text": "Bhabadah, often called the \"Sorrow of Jessore\", where water is a symbol of suffering, hunger, disease, and death. The perennial waterlogging triggered from Bhabadah point affects mainly three upazilas -- Abhaynagar, Manirampur and Keshabpur -- home to some 10 lakh people. This year, almost six lakh inhabitants were affected when the flood situation was at its worst during the rainy season. Five months later, things have improved but many farmers won't still be able to grow crops. But what's the cause of Bhabadah's woes? Is there no solution? There is. Why is it not happening then? In this two-part story, WASIM BIN HABIB and TUHIN SHUBHRA ADHIKARY chronicle Bhabadah's saga at a time when, with much of the vast land still under this year's floodwaters, many beel people are wondering how they will prepare for the next rain.  On a pale October afternoon, Hari Chand Mandal was gazing at Beel Bokor, one of the 27 major beels in Bhabadah. As he sat on the bank of the vast, black wetland, a soft autumn breeze made ripples on its surface. But Hari, 40, showed no interest in the wavelets. He had another, more pressing thought.  \"I won't be able to grow Boro paddy on my land this year for sure,\" said the marginal farmer from Mashiahati Uttar Para of Abhaynagar in Jessore. Farmers in other parts of the country have already started cultivating Boro rice, but those in Abhaynagar, Manirampur and Keshabpur upazilas see a grim prospect. Five months after the rainy season ended in July, some of their croplands still remain submerged by knee to waist-deep waters.  Just two months ago, Hari's life was full of miseries. With his elderly parents, wife and college-going son, he took shelter in a hut he built on a road, after the entire village went under waist-high waters following a heavy rain in mid-August (424mm or about 17 inches of rain in just three days -- August 10, 11 and 20). Until mid-October, hundreds of families, including his, lived in such shacks and ate whatever food they had managed to store during dry season. The floodwaters now have receded from most homesteads, but not from their farmlands. \"If the water stays a few more months, we will have to go unfed,\" Hari told The Daily Star in late October. His anxiety is shared by thousands of families in the three upazilas known as Bhabadah area, between Jessore and Khulna in southern Bangladesh. The area is crisscrossed by seven main rivers -- the Mukteshwari, Teka, Hari, Sree, Aparbhadra, Harihar and Buribhadra -- and many canals.  Aptly called the \"Sorrow of Jessore,\" much of Bhabadah remains inundated for months during rain almost every year. This year, about 600,000 people in 286 villages have been affected in various degrees, according to Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) officials in Jessore.  With all the rivers and canals silted up over the last three decades, the rain waters have nowhere to go now. So they get trapped in these beels, submerging homesteads, farmlands, roads and educational institutions. When the waterlogging is at its worst, normal life comes to a standstill in these beels spreading over 487 square kilometres. There is hardly any work. Living space becomes so scarce that sometimes a whole family shares a single room with their cattle. Others sell out their domestic animals at nominal prices. Water gets contaminated, causing various skin and water-borne diseases. Fishes die. Sometimes water snakes, frogs and other poisonous bugs, looking for a dry place, enter their huts, creating panic. This year, at least 11 people, mostly children, drowned or died from snake bites, media reports said citing government officials. Angered and shocked, hundreds of Bhabadah people travelled to Noapara, some 10km away, on October 5 to take to the streets, demanding government action. They were met with police action instead, in which some 50 people, including women and elderly campaigners, were injured. Bhabadah's waterlogging problem began in the early 1980s when all its rivers started drying up, after the construction of costal embankments and sluice gates in the region. The embankments and sluice gates were built to prevent saline water from intruding into the beels. The saline water stopped, and so did the natural flow of currents in the process. Successive governments have taken up various projects worth hundreds of crores of taka to solve this, but they only brought brief relief. Many of the projects were faulty. But more than that, every time the government initiated any projects, powerful locals blocked those to protect their interests, including the multi-million dollar shrimp farms.  This year, the problem turned acute. In the last three years, nothing was done to keep the rivers navigable. So when the entire area went under water, the BWDB installed an excavator to flush out waters by making a channel on the Hari river on August 30. It was too little too late. Before this temporary measure could have an impact, some 73,400 hectres of land went under water. As a result, all of Bhabadah's 15,000 hectres of Aus and Aman farmland were damaged and some 300 schools and colleges had to stop educational activities for about a month, officials said.  Last month, local MP Shawpan Bhattacharjee estimated farmers won't be able to grow crops on half their land this Boro season. Contacted on Sunday, Emdad Hossain Sheikh, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture Extension in Jessore, admitted some croplands were still under water. However, farmers would be able to cultivate their land by pumping out the water by shallow pumps. But farmers and a local journalist who visited two beels on Sunday said that would be extremely difficult, even impossible, for many given the height of the water. When The Daily Star visited the affected areas in Abhaynagar and Manirampur in late October, some families were still marooned in their shabby huts with waters all around. Many were still living on the roads while many others were repairing their badly damaged houses. As floodwaters devoured her earthen house in Digholiya village in Abhaynaga's Paira union, Nurjahan, a 43-year-old widow, sent her grandchildren to her sister's in Noapara. Her two sons made a six by seven feet hut with bamboo and straw on a road. There, she lived with her sons and their wives for two months. She kept her cattle inside her hut. \"The life we lived was not at all a human life,\" she said. Drinking water was scarce; there were no proper toilets, only makeshift ones built on roads. Women used those mostly at night; many drank little water during day to avoid going to toilets. People struggled to take the sick to hospitals or bury their dead. \"There was water everywhere. We buried our sister-in-law in another village, three kilometres from ours,\" said Abdul Wahab Majumdar, also from Digholiya. But those that still live are trapped; they have nowhere to go. Thousands, if not lakhs, of marginal farmers, day labourers, small vendors have had little income for the past four months. By now, they have run out of their savings and food stocks. As they count their losses -- livelihoods, homes, loved ones -- floodwaters in some beels are showing little sign of receding from their farmlands, and it's not clear when they will be able to work again and start a normal life.  Bhabadah's deep-seated waterlogging problem has its origin in the 1960s. The region had a different problem then. This low-lying area would be inundated during rain by the rising waters of the major rivers that crisscross this marshy land before falling into the Bay of Bengal about 60km to its south.   This extremely saline water posed a serious threat to crops, cattle, fish and human alike. So the then Pakistan government took up a huge project funded by the Asian Development Bank and assisted by the USAID. Under this Coastal Embankment Project, around 1,500 kilometres of embankments, 282 sluice gates and some 35 polders were constructed along the rivers from 1961 to 1967. On the Sree river alone, a 21-vent sluice gate was built at Bhabadah point to turn the vast swamps into arable land. Initially, the project was a hit; the area saw a bumper food production, said Jahangir Alam, member of the executive committee of Bangladesh Economic Association, who has been working on the waterlogging issue for years. Farmers were so happy that they gave Abdul Monem Khan, the then governor of East Pakistan, a \"gold scythe\" as a gift, said Jahangir, who wrote a research paper on the problem and its solution. But the whole project turned out to be a catastrophe within two decades. Before the polders were built to trap the saline water, tides used to flow inland, depositing sediments at high tide, creating a balance with the natural land subsidence. Polders (a Dutch word) are a low-lying tract of land enclosed by dikes that forms an artificial waterbody. They have no connections with outside water other than through manually operated devices. However, after the construction of the embankments, sluice gates and polders, silt started to deposit on the riverbeds, while subsidence of the land within the polders continued. The natural process of land formation inside the polders came to a halt in the 1980s. At the same time, currents in the upstream rivers -- mainly the Padma (Ganges in India) and its tributaries, particularly Bhairab which flows through Abhaynagar -- grew weak after India built the Farakka Embankment on the Ganges and started withdrawing water in the 1970s, said Prof M Shahjahan Mondal of the Institute of Water and Flood Management at the Buet. In addition, the Coastal Embankment Project did not pay attention to silt management and so there was no long-term plan for river dredging in the area to clear the deposited silt. As a result, currents of these rivers lost force and the rivers started drying up and eventually the exit points of the sluice gates got blocked. \"In fact that [the embankment project] was the beginning of the ever-present calamity for the people, environment and nature,\" said Iqbal Kabir Jahid, chief adviser of Bhabadah Pani Nishkashon Sangram Committee, a platform campaigning for a solution for over a decade."

      "text": "Despite the government's assurance that the Rampal power plant would not harm the Sundarbans, the Unesco stays firm in its stance against the project and has again requested the government to cancel and relocate it to a more suitable place. Otherwise, the UN's culture and science agency may place the forest on the list of \"World Heritage in Danger\" next year, says a report posted on its website on Tuesday. The report, titled \"Report On The Mission To The Sundarbans World Heritage Site, Bangladesh\", came after the government responded to Unesco's concerns over the Rampal project, saying it would go ahead with the power plant as it would not \"harm\" the Sundarbans. On October 9, Nurul Karim, acting secretary of the environment and forest ministry, sent a 63-page letter to M Shahidul Islam, permanent representative of Bangladesh to the Unesco. Contacted, Nasrul Hamid, state minister for power, energy and mineral resources, yesterday told The Daily Star, \"They [Unesco] did not include our reply in their report.  They have prepared the report from their own point of view.\" Asked whether the government would change its decision to implement the project at Rampal which is barely 14 kilometres off the forest, he said the construction work of the power plant has already started. \"We are going to use the ultra-supercritical technologies at the Rampal power plant. It is not going to harm the Sundarbans.\" In the report, the Unesco also requested the government to submit a report on the state of conservation of the Sundarbans to the World Heritage Centre within December 1. The World Heritage Committee will examine the report at its 41st general session in 2017, and decide on the listing of the property (the Sundarbans) on the \"World Heritage in Danger\" list. A joint team of experts from the United Nations Education Scientific Cultural Organisations (Unesco) and IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) prepared the report following a visit to Bangladesh from March 22 to 28. The mission was tasked with reviewing potential impacts from the construction of the Rampal power plant, assessing risks from climate change, and evaluating the overall management system of the Sundarbans, including provisions around shipping safety, says the report. In the report, the expert team identified four key concerns related to the construction of the plant. The concerns include pollution from coal ash by air, pollution from wastewater and waste ash, increased shipping and dredging, and the cumulative impact of industrial and related development infrastructure on the forest. It said the plant's construction would result in a substantial increase in shipping and dredging in the area. Mentioning the Sundarbans with a fragile ecosystem, the report also expressed concerns over the issue, saying the freshwater flow into the forest has been drastically reduced, resulting in substantial increases in siltation and salinity that are threatening the overall balance of the ecosystem. The report recommended the government's immediate action to secure adequate freshwater flow to the Sundarbans. It also calls for preparing a new integrated management plan that would consist how much pressure of development the fragile ecosystem the Sundarbans may bear. The report also said though the government assured the Unesco that the power plant project of Orion had been cancelled, the Orion Group website states that Orion Power Khulna Ltd has already started implementation of the project at the site. The Unesco inscribed the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forests, home to the famous Bengal Tiger and a hotspot for dolphins, turtles, and birds, on their world heritage list in 1997. Millions of people depend on this labyrinth of tidal rivers for food, homes, and flood protection. Asked, Anwar Hossain Manju, minister for environment and forest, yesterday said he was not updated everything about the project as the ministry of energy and power was dealing with the matter. \"If they request for a conservancy plan for the Sundarbans, we will make it,\" he said. Meanwhile, the National committee for Saving the Sundarbans, which is fighting to save the forest, issued a statement yesterday, hailing the report posted on the Unesco website. \"It would be a matter of shame for Bangladesh, a country that is vulnerable to climate change, if the Unesco inscribes the Sundarbans on the World Heritage in Danger list,\" said the statement, signed by the committee's Secretary General Abdul Matin. It also demanded that the Indian government do not collaborate with Bangladesh in constructing the \"second class\" coal-fired power plant in Bangladesh that would harm the forest and also the people of Bangladesh."

      "text": "No book offers any chronological history of the ancient fortified city of Bhitargarh. But ruins of this 1500-year-old city are so loud and clear that the city's outlines are visible from space. Try Google Earth, hover over Panchagarh where this city was located and see it for yourself. As archaeologists have unearthed nine new structures in recent years, Bhitargarh is emerging as the biggest fortified city in South Asia. Located about 16km north of Panchagarh, Bhitargarh is protected by four quadrangle walls made of earth and bricks -- each maintaining a considerable distance from another. Its outer walls accompanied by moats surround a 25-square kilometre area. These walls protected the city from flood as well as notorious thugs' invasion. The civilisation was technologically so advanced that they had made stone dams and diverted the Shalmara river-course inside the fortified city to retain water for households and agricultural use during the dry season. Sadly, except for a few remaining stones, the large dam does not exist now. \"The nine monuments date back to the early medieval period, eight of them are temples and the rest is a residential complex,\" says Shahnaj Husne Jahan, professor and director of Centre for Archaeological Studies of University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB). Shahnaj has been working there with her students since 2008.  She also suggests that Bhitargarh was an independent city state governed by a sovereign administration between the 6th and 13th centuries. Understanding the history of Bhitargarh is difficult because it has no inscription or written records. Archaeologists must depend on the ruins and myths that are still alive among the locals. The city builders used bricks with mud to build the first, second and some strategic points of the third quadrangle walls, as those were built before the introduction of lime and surki (brick dust) for constructions. The fourth one was built with mud only. The city's monuments were built before people learnt to use lime and surki to build structures. Its long walls and temple bricks were stuck with mud. There is no use of medieval arches and domes. Instead, its architects used columns, lintels and beams to support the tiled roof. Archaeologists have found broken pieces of tiled roof there. The site has 10 water reservoirs, including the notorious Maharajar Dighi. According to local myth, a king of this city named Prithu Raja along with his guards committed suicide in this water body when they were cornered by \"unholy\" Kichok tribe that had attacked the city. According to Prof Shahnaj, a reference to the Kichok tribe can be found in Mahabharata, which illustrates how Pandava brothers fought against the Kichok tribes. \"May be they were the descendants of the Kirata who lived in the mountain country between Nepal and Bhutan. Now the Indian state known as Cooch Behar is actually the place where the Kichoks established their kingdom in the middle age.\" In the fortified city, archaeologists also found many items of daily use such as pottery, earthen lamps, terracotta beads, and copper and iron objects.  The city had a significant role in trade, as its strategic location in the ancient overland and river routes connected it to Tibet, Sikkim, Nepal, Bhutan, Assam, Cooch Behar and lower valleys of the Ganges. LEGENDS OF PRITHU RAJA If you visit this place, you will get to hear local folklores about the ruined city as the capital of a kingdom headed by Prithu. Most of the heaps of earth that survive the ravages of time are named after him -- Maharajar Bhita, Maharajar Kacharighar and Maharajar Dighi. According to Prof Shahnaj, the genealogy of kings of Cooch Behar included one \"Maharaja Prithu\". She connects that history with local stories and believes that Prithu was the last king of this grand fortified city around 13th century. According to local myths, Prithu Raja would rather let his kingdom go to ruins than see it surrendered to a savage tribe called Kichoks. Prithu was respected and deified by his subjects, and he could not stand seeing his \"purity sullied\" by such savages. So the king decided to end his life by throwing himself into a water reservoir named Maharajar Dighi, followed by his guards, thus leaving his kingdom to despair and plunder. Professor Shahnaj expressed despair at the state of Bhitargarh, saying that lack of preservation efforts could result in the settlement being lost forever. Despite a High Court stay order prohibiting all sorts of construction around the site, inhabitants of Bhitargarh continue to extend cultivation and habitation by demolishing the walls and monuments in the area. \"Bhitargarh is on the verge of collapse, as locals are building structures within the site, violating the High Court's order imposing a suspension on all kinds of constructional work in the area,\" explained Shahnaj. Commenting on the ongoing devastation of archaeological sites, Altaf Hossain, director general of Department of Archaeology, admitted that they have limitations, and also said they have very little to do to stop this destruction. \"But we have formed a committee which includes members of the district administration, cultural ministry and land administration. We are trying to acquire land with the help of the Ministry of Land. Now we are working to make people conscious about the heritage site,\" he said. However, there are over 700 acres of government-owned land, but the department has apparently done nothing to acquire them to preserve the site. The recent excavation and subsequent preservation efforts of a ghat at Maharajar Dighi bear the signs of sheer negligence. Part of it has been cut off allegedly by former lawmaker Mazharul Haque Prodhan to build a staircase. Now, after the said preservation began, roots of a huge tree still remain in the ghat wall. That might collapse along with the ancient wall. \"We asked the district administration to cut it, and I am hopeful that they will do so soon,\" Altaf said. Instead of sitting idle like the rest of us, Dr Shahnaj and her team are actually working towards protecting a significant part of our history. All we need to do is support them in their endeavour, so that their efforts will not go in vain. "

      "text": "Two Chinese companies yesterday signed preliminary agreements with Bangladesh to develop three components of Payra seaport with $510 million in funds. The agreements with China Harbour Engineering Company and China State Construction Engineering Corporation were signed at the shipping ministry in Dhaka. China Harbour Engineering will build the core port infrastructure at $150 million. China State Construction Engineering will fortify riparian areas to reduce flood risk and soil erosion at a cost of $300 million. It will also set up housing, education and health facilities at $60 million. Md Saidur Rahman, chairman of the Payra Port Authority; Zeng Nanhai, joint managing director of China Harbour; and Li Shujiang, managing director of China State Construction, signed the deals. Speaking at the signing ceremony, Shipping Minister Shajahan Khan said the operation of Payra port began in August, earning Tk 17 crore in revenue so far.  If all infrastructures can be put in place, it will add 1 percentage point to the country's gross domestic product, he said.  Shipping Secretary Ashok Madhob Roy said the agreements would be implemented on a government-to-government basis. He requested both parties to sign the loan agreements as soon as possible as the implementation of the deals will only begin after the financing contracts are signed. The three components awarded to the Chinese companies are crucial as the work for container terminal, bulk terminal, passenger terminal, and power plants will take off only after they are completed. The Payra seaport, the third in Bangladesh, is being constructed at an estimated cost of $16 billion. India will also invest $750 million in the seaport to construct a multipurpose container terminal. The shipping secretaries of India and Bangladesh talked about the issue during a meeting in Dhaka on Wednesday. Three tanks for crude oil and another three for diesel will be set up on the Moheshkhali Island in the Bay of Bengal. The project is expected to start operations in December 2018. The project aims to unload imported crude and finished petroleum products easily and reduce cost and time, according to BPC. It also aims to help expand Bangladesh's refinery capacity and ensure energy security. Bangladesh cannot handle large vessels because of low navigability at Karnaphuli River and constrained facilities at Chittagong port. As a result, large vessels carrying imported crude and finished oil have to anchor at deep sea, and small vessels are used to unload and bring in the petroleum products. As a result, it takes 11 days to unload a 100,000 dead weight tonnage tanker to unload the product. The existing system will also not be effective if Bangladesh wants to import more crude oil to meet the growing energy demand. But once the pipeline is installed, it will bring down the unloading time, said Mahmud Reza Khan, chairman of BPC. Nasrul Hamid, state minister for power and energy, said the pipeline will save the country Tk 1,000 crore a year in reduced vessel fare and operational loss. Abul Kalam Azad, principal coordinator for sustainable development goals affairs at the Prime Minister's Office, urged the Chinese company to complete the project within the scheduled time. Yujian of CPP Bureau said his company would deliver high-quality infrastructure. Md Tajul Islam, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on energy ministry, said the new infrastructure will help meet the growing energy demand. Nazimuddin Chowdhury, energy secretary, also spoke. CPP Bureau is the engineering procurement construction contractor for the project while Germany's ILF Consulting Engineers worked as the consultant for the project. Eastern Refinery Ltd, owned by BPC, can process 15 lakh tonnes of crude oil a year at the moment. The government plans to raise the processing capacity by another 30 lakh tonnes through setting up the second unit of ERL in two to three years. Once the second unit comes into operation, ERL would be able to meet 75 percent of the country's annual demand for finished fuel. The second unit will help the country save $220 million, said BPC officials earlier. Bangladesh now imports 35 lakh tonnes of diesel every year. In total, the country consumes 55 lakh tonnes of different types of petroleum products every year. London-based BMI Research also said Bangladesh will benefit more if it imports refined petroleum products instead of bringing in crude oil and refining it at home. The country imports crude oil from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and refined fuels from countries such as Malaysia, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia and Brunei, Turkey, Kuwait, the UAE and Oman.

      "text": "Once there was a network of waterways linking rivers and canals across the capital. If anyone wanted to visit Narayanganj or any other places from Gabtoli through the waterways, it was very much possible. But the network in most parts of the city has stopped due to the construction of the flood protection embankment in the western part of the city. During the construction, Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) did not keep the mouth of the canals that linked with Turag and Buriganga rivers open or constructed any of the sluice gates bigger for boats to cross.  The city had over 50 canals which were not only inter-connected, but also had a link with Buriganga, Shitalakhya, Turag and Balu rivers, surrounding the capital. But a good number of them started to die and the rowing of boats stopped since the construction of the embankment almost cut them off from the rivers. The 36km embankment started from Tongi to Killarmore in Lalbagh and the 3.8km flood wall cum road stretched from Killarmore to Postogola (Buriganga bridge-1). But the road constructions from Jatrabari to Tongi via Sayedabad, Maniknagar, Rampura, Kuril Biswa road and Airport road has cordoned off the 136 square km areas, which are considered as the benefited areas of the embankment. A storm water pumping station at Rampura bridge, constructed in 1993, also became a barrier for the boats plying in canals, which fell under the area. Since construction of the Rampura storm water pump station, rowing of boats continued only from Rampura bridge near the Rampura TV station to the eastern part. But the waterways from the western and middle part of the city also came to a stop. The canals including Hazaribagh, Rayerbazar, Ramchandrapur, Katasur, Gabtoli, Kallyanpur main canal and its branches, Dhanmondi, Razabazar, Kathalbagan, Paribagh and Begun Bari had lost its navigability and link. The construction of box culverts and roads exaggerated the situation and many canals are now alive only in names, while many disappeared. \"Back in 74/75, boats carrying goods would dock at Begunbari canal, which stopped completely after a regulator pump at Rampura was constructed,\" said Azizur Rashid Babu, a Moghbazar resident. Since construction of Tongi Diversion road, built in the 80s, boat movements also reduced, he said. During a recent visit to the embankment it was found that most of the 54 sluice gates were not properly maintained, and at many points there was no sign of sluice gates. The ones that were operative were found in a bad condition as the mouths of the gates were almost blocked due to encroachments and continuous garbage dumping. Contacted, a Wasa official said that they have so far cleaned four sluice gates a few months back and are planning to continue the cleaning works. \"The Rayerbazar canal had a link with Buriganga before the embankment construction and small boats used to ply there,\" said Anowar Hossain, an elderly resident of Rayerbazar. Hazaribagh canal also had a link with Buriganga and confluence with Rayerbazar canal at (now) Rayerbazar's Hashem Khan road. During a recent visit it was found that there was a temporary Wasa pumping station from where the water of Hazaribagh came at the point but there was no sign of Rayerbazar canal.  BWDB Chief Engineer (central zone) Abul Kalam Azad said the embankment was constructed between 1992 and 2003. He said under the project three storm water pumping stations were constructed at Goran Chatbari, Kallyanpur and Dholaikhal and 54 sluice gates were constructed. Prof Emeritus of Brac University Ainun Nishat, a water resources and climate change specialist, said Dhaka was built on the eastern bank of the Buriganga. It is called old Dhaka now, which gradually spread to the east and north side as the portions were highlands, he added. He said Adabor in Mohammadpur and Kallyanpur (which are now residential areas) used to come under water regularly till 1987. \"I saw big boats even in the 70s near Lazz Pharma at Russell Square. There were big boats near Rampura TV station in the 80s also,\" he said. Nishat said the embankment was constructed in haste after the 1988 flood and was reconstructed after demolishing the old one. The BWDB traditionally controls flood without protecting the waterways, fish routes and water bodies, but now it has started to think about those, he said. The 11 guiding principals of flood management were prepared in 1989, approved by the cabinet of the then government where it was also mentioned to consider about the environment, he said. Nishat said it was also recommended to keep the mouths of the canals open and keeping sufficient gates during the embankment construction. But the planning commission at that time approved to construct small sluice gates to reduce expenditure, he said. Nishat, one of the key members who prepared the management principals, said they had requested the then government to not to go for the embankment, but rather consider road networks. If they would have considered, the design would have been changed, which would have saved the marshy lands on the western part, he said. There is Balu river on the north-south side of the eastern part of the city, Turag and Bongshai rivers on the northwest side of the western part, and Burigana is on the southwest and Shitalakhya is situated at the southeast, said Nishat. He said that probably in the Mughal era, a link was made between Balu and Turag rivers through Tongi canal. There was a river route surrounding the capital and people would enter through different canals. In the developed countries, they protect their canals, which are navigable and waterbuses run through them and people can move from one side to the other smoothly, he said. Nishat said during the embankment construction, the sluice gates should have been bigger and a gate should have been kept with the facility of boat crossing so that people could go to the rivers through the canals easily. In an article published in The Daily Star, Prof Nazrul Islam, former professor of economics, Dhaka University, said the only solution to the conundrum lies in the abandonment of the cordon approach and adoption of the open approach to rivers. \"The process of sealing off the city from her rivers has to be reversed. The canals have to be allowed to meet the rivers,\" he said. Prof Nazrul said the already constructed western embankment has to be transformed from a cordon into an embankment with sluice gates for canal water to pass and also for river water to enter up to the acceptable limit."

      "text": "The challenge of change: From a colonial society to an independent state \nOur current history begins from the emergence of independent states in societies which till then had been under colonial rule. Independence promised to usher in social change. Colonial societies were marked by feudal hierarchies, patron-client relationships, and disparities of wealth, class and caste. Equal opportunities for self realisation were a far cry as access to education and access to health for all was a distant goal. A classic work by an anthropologist on post-colonial Africa bears the title From Subject to Citizen. In a colonial society, a person was the subject of an imperial ruler, whose viceroys exercised executive authority without constitutional limits. They were thus under no constitutional obligation to respect the fundamental rights of their subjects, nor in these societies could the subjects seek judicial protection of their rights. Upon independence, subjects emerged as citizens, whose fundamental rights were recognised. In the realisation of these rights, the judiciary was to make a significant contribution. A Constitution has been described by the architect of the South African Constitution as \"the autobiography of a nation\". It reflects its history and many of its provisions can best be understood as responses to the historical experience of the nation and as providing guide-posts to a future which is free from the negative features of the past. A Constitution is thus both a document that a generation drafts in the light of its experience and the prevailing currents of thought and which seeks to anticipate the future and to provide a framework for orderly change. Constitutions which mark freedom from colonial or authoritarian rule must necessarily promise change to correct the disparities and inequalities inherited from the old order. The fundamental rights clauses and the directive or fundamental principles of state policy provide a reservoir of legal resources which can be drawn upon to bring about such change. They provide the mandate for innovative laws, innovative institutions and remedies and for affirmative action designed to give substance to the constitutional pledges of freedom, equality and justice.  Expanding frontiers of judicial review\nThe incorporation of a Bill of Rights in our Constitution and conferment on the judiciary the power of judicial review and the power to enforce fundamental rights has enabled the judiciary to play a profoundly catalytic role. By expanding the frontiers of judicial review, and by being creatively proactive, the judiciary has drawn upon the resources in our constitution to promote social change. The judiciary has been promoting social change through rights-friendly interpretations of the Constitution aimed at implementation of economic and social rights. The increasingly positive attitude of the judiciary towards public interest litigation, overcoming earlier inhibitions which had constrained the role of the judiciary, has enabled the judiciary to play a dynamic role in facilitating and promoting social change. Judicial review has continued to expand in South Asia on the premise that while every organ functioning under the Constitution has limits it is for the court to determine those limits. This has accounted for the expansion of the scope of judicial review. The challenge of implementation of economic and social rights has seen innovative approaches being applied, including the development of public interest litigation. New challenges are presented by the issues, among others, of gender justice, bonded labour, forcible eviction of slum dwellers, and different forms of environmental degradation which have had to be dealt with by the judiciary.  In Bangladesh following a landmark judgment delivered by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh in 1999 which held that an Association of Environmental Lawyers had standing to present a writ petition in the public interest, public interest litigation has grown significantly. The petition had successfully challenged the legal validity of a flood action plan prepared without any participation of concerned and affected persons which threatened adversely to affect the lives and livelihood of substantial sections of people and to have adverse environmental and ecological effects. The Supreme Court has entertained public interest petitions relating to a wide range of issues including industrial safety (fires and unsafe factory buildings of garment factories), environment (the gas explosion in a gas field), corruption (illegal granting of public land without following proper procedures), inhuman custodial practices (imposition of bar fetters in judicial custody, confinement of rape victims (in handcuffs) and other women in \"safe\" custody) and forcible eviction of slum dwellers. Judiciary as enforcer of Constitution\nThe responsibility for effective execution of constitutional and legislative mandates expressed through statutes rests clearly upon the executive. If the executive defaults on its legal and constitutional obligations however, courts and judges cannot take a view that violations of rights involved in such defaults are no concern of theirs. If the duly authorised constitutional officers fail to discharge their constitutional and legal obligations, an activist of judiciary is justified in issuing directions to them to discharge their duties expeditiously. If there are large numbers of under-trial prisoners, not brought to trial for a long time, a judge might feel more than justified in ordering expeditious trials for their release. If conditions in jails are inhuman and debasing, a judge may order corrective action. If slum dwellers are threatened with forcible eviction, they can seek and obtain protection from the Judiciary. The Constitution is a living document which reflects the aspirations of the people and aims at promoting progress, peace, welfare, and amity among the citizens; it is the basic structure on which the entire edifice is built. An independent judiciary thus has a critical role to play as guardian of the Constitution and as a catalyst for social change. The writer is Senior Advocate, Supreme Court of Bangladesh, an eminent jurist and one of the architects of the Constitution of Bangladesh."

During a recent visit there, this correspondent found the lake almost filled. At least 30 trucks were dumping soil into the water body. Encroaching on fresh areas, the project site was expanding fast towards Vacurta and Basila villages. Also, new buildings sprouted there. Locals said the Modhumoti authorities engaged many trucks as they wanted to fill the area before the government could take any action.  No project official was found when the correspondent visited the site on May 30. \"They have been filling the lake for the last three days and the main project area for the last one month,\" a security guard at the Modhumoti site told this correspondent. Many people came to see the plots, he said when asked whether the land was up for sale. Reached over the phone the next day, Zakaria Khan, general manager of Modhumoti Model Town, said they were not involved in the filling work. \"We have just come to know about this incident. It is not us but our clients who are developing the site,\" he said, adding that the work, however, has stopped following intervention of the local administration. He claimed they sold the lake in 2006. Contacted on June 5, Kamrul Hasan Mollah, upazila nirbahi officer of Savar, said he saw the lake and lowland being filled up while on his way to the capital a few days ago. He asked Modhumoti people if they had the required permission, and wanted to see relevant papers. But they failed to show any. \"So, I asked them not to continue the work. Now I am waiting for a copy of the court order on Modhumoti project. Once I get it, I'll take legal action against them for illegally filling up the wetland and low-lying areas,\" he said. The High Court on July 27, 2005, declared Modhumoti Model Town project at Bilamalia and Baliarpur near Aminbazar of Savar unauthorised and against public interest as it was on a flood-flow zone demarcated in the Dhaka City Master Plan. The court also asked the authorities to restore the wetlands in the project area. In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the HC verdict after the Modhumoti authorities had appealed.  The HC judgment came after Bangladesh Environment Lawyers Association (Bela) in August 2004 filed a writ petition as public interest litigation challenging the legality of the project for violating the Environment Conservation Act, Town Improvement Act and Rajuk rules. Following the court order, nobody is supposed to fill or expand the site, or build any structures there, Bela's chief executive told The Daily Star. The Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) and local administration were supposed to monitor the matter. Contacted, Kamrul Hasan, deputy town planner of Rajuk, said they did not know that Modhumoti was filling the lowland again, violating the court order. \"We are going to take action against it,\" he told this newspaper. The Modhumoti Model Town, a project of Metro Makers and Developers Ltd, was set up on 550 acres of land in 1990 in Aminbazar beside Dhaka-Savar road, on the outskirts of the capital. The sale of Modhumoti plots began in 2001, says its website."

      "text": "The silver or copper jewellery you picked to go with your dress was not made at the shop you bought it from. It was probably handcrafted miles away in Savar on the outskirts of the capital. One village where this sort of intricate crafting is done is Bhakurta. Hundreds of people -- men, women, young and old -- meticulously create the foundation of ornaments every day from silver and copper.  If you pay a visit to the village, you will see some people are using fire to melt the metal, some making strings while some are piecing together designs to make ornaments. These artisans complete 95 percent of the ornaments before those are shipped to the stores where sparkling stones and colours are added and finishing touches are given. The jewellery-making business has made the village renowned. \"Our jewellery are not only catering to the demands in Bangladesh; they also go to Italy, Middle East and India,\" said Dulal Rajbangshi, general secretary of Bhakurta Bazar Gold Silver and Imitation Merchants Cooperative Samity. Opu Das is another jeweller. He and his brother inherited the family business of making anklets from silver. The 36-year-old himself has been in the trade for the last 15 years. Chaity Jewellers, run by Opu, employs seven artisans who make jewellery from silver and copper. On an average, they make 300 pairs of anklets a month to fill orders from stores in the capital's Tantibazar, the jewellers' hub in the country. The village's expertise in jewellery-making dates back to 1980s when most male members used to work for jewellery shops in Tantibazar. But when finished gold items started to flood the market in the 1990s, their demand fell. Some of them returned to their village homes and began making jewellery from silver. They were able to make a living from the trade between 1995 and 2010. Again the silver jewellery market faced a downturn. This was the time when the village artisans started to look for an alternative, as this was the only trade they knew. They found copper as an alternative to silver. They used the designs of gold and silver jewellery to create a market. Now there are about 100 shops in Bhakurta Bazar and at least 50 shops each in adjacent Solar Market and Bottola Bazar, Dulal said. In total, there are 500 shops and households involved in the trade, providing livelihood to at least 2,500 families in Bhakurta and neighbouring villages. \"When we started producing jewellery from copper, people doubted whether the jewellery will sell. But the demand for our jewellery is good,\" he told The Daily Star on June 23. Actual combined sales figures are hard to come by. Dulal puts the average daily sales at Tk 5 lakh and it goes up during the peak season in the winter. The annual sales might come to Tk 20 crore. Sales also go up ahead of Eid festivals, particularly in Eid-ul-Fitr, according to Dulal. Bhakurta's artisans have not abandoned silver completely -- about 75 percent of jewellery is made up of copper and the rest from silver and gold. Initially, some craftsmen used to import raw materials and chemicals from India. Now those are locally available. The artisans start working around 8:00am and continue until midnight, but the wage is very low, said 45-year-old Dulal. Opu earns Tk 100 a bhori as making charge while his artisans from the village get Tk 40 a bhori. Women are a large part of the business. Jewellers say there are jobs that male artisans are not interested in because of low return. These jobs are left to the village women who prefer to work in their leisure time to supplement the income of their families. One of them is Shoma Rani. These correspondents found her sitting on the stairs of her rented house, meticulously making small coiled copper thread to be used in necklaces. She said she could make one kg of copper thread a day, which earned her Tk 400. \"I do this whenever I get time as my income can give my two children better food, clothes and education,\" said Shoma whose husband is also an artisan. Her two daughters -- Sathi Akhtar and Dipti Rani Sarker -- were sitting with her. Sathi, 12, studies in class-VI at a school in the village and Dipti, aged 14, is a student of class-VIII in the same school. Sathi makes copper threads while Dipti puts beads on necklaces and other jewellery. Dipti says she has learnt it from her mother and aunt who are also involved in jewellery making. Hindu families used to dominate the trade in the past. But now many Muslims have joined in. At present, 95 percent Hindu population of the village and 50 percent Muslims are involved in the trade, according to Dulal. Thirty-year-old Ali Asgar has been in the business in Bhakurta Bazar for more than a decade. He runs a shop of raw materials and chemicals. He also has 30 artisans working for him from their homes and making jewellery. \"I sell the items to wholesalers in different parts of Dhaka and some buyers from India,\" he said."

      "text": "The stunning Swat valley has been at the epicentre of many tragedies, so much so that even the hands writing her elegies have run out of words. Be it extremism or catastrophe, there's no calamity that has not yet descended upon the dwellers of Swat. When I arrived in Swat after passing through many army checkpoints, it was late evening. I marvelled at my scenic surroundings and inhaled the autumnal air. The full moon seemed to play hide and seek. A well-educated and young Pakhtun cabbie stood in front of me -- a serious look in his eyes, a smile playing on his lips. \"Sahib, are you here for a visit? Should I take you to a hotel? he asked. I ended up going with him to Swat's Mingora bazaar which was bursting with life. I found it vastly different from my last visit which was a good 10 years ago. Now it also boasts of many designers stores. The only thing that has remained unchanged over the years is the crowd. It was here that a fellow traveller had offered me a cup of kahva (traditional green tea). As I stood there reminiscing about the kahva, I could smell its aroma in the air. Mingora also brought back my carefree youth -- when there was always plenty of energy and no restrictions. We would joke about Pakhtuns in front of them in the bazaar. The jokes would invite nothing but lively cackles and twinkling eyes. So much had changed since then, I mused. I cruised through the bazaar for a long time, observing people. Later, I spent the night besides River Swat in Fiza Ghat. I woke up to a crystal clear sky the next morning. Soon afterwards, I hit the road to drive through the streets of Swat. Proceeding towards Kabal tehsil from Mingora, I could see plenty of cemented link roads, shining in the sunlight. I saw many trucks piled with vegetables and other goods. I saw small canals irrigating fields and bridges erected on canals with signboards thanking the Saudi Fund for Development Pakistan. The disputes on distribution of irrigation water must have reduced, I thought to myself. This was confirmed by a local named Khazta Baz Khan with whom I interacted while he was enjoying the early-morning sunlight on his charpoy in the middle of his field. \"Earlier the fields near the streams would absorb all the water during the drought season, leaving nothing for the tail-end fields. During the rainy season, water would overflow, creating a flood-like situation. Now, at least, all the fields receive their fair share of irrigation water.\" I sat with Baz Khan on his charpoy. An ancient cassette player played his favourite cassette. He told me that he had preserved it for many years. After a brief chit chat, his servant fetched us a jug of fresh buttermilk. \"Khan sahib! What's this lady singing?\" I asked. \"My beauty has killed half of the village and the other half will be killed soon.\" We laugh loudly, rousing his labourers picking tomatoes in the field who, too, smile. I spent the night in Khwazakhela after wandering through 4-5 villages in Kabal during the day. It was a cold night. In the dark, the fields seemed to have vanished and the electric bulbs in the distance were the only signs of civilisation. There was no moon and no people in the streets whereas just a little while ago, children had played on the streets. Next afternoon, I went to a village in Matta tehsil. I saw some children playing in the streets who I notice look afraid for some reason. I also met with some locals and heard their stories of hardships and grievances. I learnt about the development works carried out by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in collaboration with SFD. One local I met with -- Zor Talab Khan -- offered me to sit with him on his charpoy. We started conversing. I asked him what were the problems that locals faced when there was no link road to his village, which was a good six kilometres away from the main road on top of a high hill. \"My father died while we were taking him to the hospital on a charpoy. It took two hours to get to the main road from here. Midway, he asked us to lower the charpoy because he knew he wouldn't survive. We kept walking and he kept screaming and then...died.\" After he relayed his story, Khan was completely silent. Seeing moisture build up in his eyes, I changed the topic and started talking about mundane things. When I took my leave, children started following me. I reached the main road, where I saw a truck crammed with people. I hopped on to my jeep. The truck and my jeep were running parallel. A Pashto song played in the truck. My driver started singing the song as well. I asked him to translate the lyrics for me. Jab main is gaun se jaun ga, to ye gaun akela hojaye ga Rotey rotey aao, mera aakhri deedaar to kar lo The village will be forlorn when I leave this place Come for the last time and meet me We drove past roads lined with peach and apple trees -- which had started shedding leaves due to autumn. Zor Khan's heartbreaking story ricocheted through my mind. There may be countless such stories here, I thought. Swat's short link roads have paved the way for better employment opportunities. The construction of bridges over streams has made the daunting task of going to school easier for students. These bridges are the roads to dreams and better futures. We pass through a village in Khwazakhela. Behind the snow-covered peaks of Hindukush, the sun was about to set. I stopped at River Swat. The setting sun casted an orange glow over the water. Two labourers were on their way home after a hard day of work. In complete solitude, I watched cranes flying over the river with Kalaam's mountain peaks in the backdrop. I watched birds vanishing as darkness took over. I stood up and began the ascent of the emerald mine in front of me. After a strenuous climb, I came to a spot where I could see the valley in all its glory; it was a humbling moment. I could not fathom that this little valley had once been in the throes of militancy.

Therefore, buildings should be safe against natural and man-made disasters, comfortable, user friendly and durable. To ensure these requirements, building construction should be done as per following steps: 1. Preparation of architectural design. 2. Preparation of structural design. 3. Preparation of plumbing, electrical and fire safety design. 4. Building construction as per the designs mentioned above. Comfort of living, user friendliness and optimum utilization of space of a building depends on the architectural design. A qualified and experienced architect can design a building, considering user's requirement and climatic condition of the geographical location of the building, so that the building will be user friendly and comfortable for habitation. Safety and durability of a building depends on the quality of structural design as well as quality of construction. Following steps should be undertaken to ensure the safety and durability of a building: 1. Structural design of the building should be done by a qualified and experienced structural engineer who shall design the building as per provisions of Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC), considering all the natural disasters like flood, storm, tidal surge and earthquake. 2. Fire safety design aspects including fire detection, protection and evacuation of a building should be done by a team of qualified and experienced architect, electrical engineer and mechanical engineer, complying fire safety provisions of BNBC. 3. Building construction should be executed under supervision of a qualified and experienced engineer who can execute the job as per design and as per BNBC. Construction quality depends on the following aspects: 1.            Use of quality construction materials. 2.            Appropriate construction methodology. In the urban area of our country, Reinforced Concrete (RC) structure is the most popular construction method. In this method the structure of the building is constructed by casting of foundation, columns, beams and slabs with concrete and reinforced with steel reinforcing bars. In RC construction, the following materials are used: 1.            Steel reinforcing bars. 2.            Cement. 3.            Crushed stone/ brick and sand. To ensure construction of building which will be safe and durable, the construction materials should be of good quality. To ensure quality of construction materials and other industrial products, there are National and International Standards organizations, responsible for setting the standards for production, quality control and testing of materials. In our country, the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute (BSTI) is in charge of setting the standards for industrial products. Consumers will be confident about the quality of materials if those are manufactured as per BSTI standards. There are many International Standards organizations, a few among those are: 1.            ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials). 2.            ISO (International Organization for Standardization). 3.            EN (European Norm). Quality aspects of the materials used to manufacture concrete in our country are briefly described below: A. Steel Reinforcing Bars. It is the core material used in RC construction works. It should be of good quality and manufactured as per BSTI standard. Consumers should be aware of the fact that, in some cases the steel reinforcing bars available in the local market are of poor quality and not manufactured as per BSTI standards. From strength consideration, there are three grades of steel reinforcing bars available in our market e.g. 40 grade, 60 grade and 75 grade. Building owners should buy steel reinforcing bars having quality and grade recommended by the structural engineer. Quality of steel reinforcing bars should be tested regularly from a standard testing laboratory. B. Cement. Cement acts as the binder in manufacturing concrete. Therefore, it should be of good quality and manufactured as per BSTI standard. In our country, there are many types of cement, produced by the manufacturers. The building owners should consult the structural engineer and the engineer in charge of building construction, before buying a particular type of cement. Routine tests to check the quality of cement should be done regularly from a standard testing laboratory having testing facilities as per BSTI standard. C. Crushed stone/ Brick and Sand. Crushed stone or brick and coarse sands are used as aggregates for manufacturing concrete. To get a good quality concrete, the aggregates should be of good quality. Aggregates produced from crushing good quality boulders are the best as coarse aggregate. On the other hand coarse river sands, free from silts and other impurities are best as fine aggregates of concrete. Crushed stone aggregates are better than crushed brick aggregates. Though a little expensive than crushed brick aggregates, buildings constructed using crushed stone aggregates are more durable than the buildings constructed with crushed brick aggregates. On the other hand, clay bricks are manufactured by destroying the fertile top soils, gradually reducing the precious total arable lands of the country. In firing of clay bricks, woods are used along with coals, eventually eliminating the forest resources and polluting the environment of the surrounding areas. We should, therefore, gradually replace the fired clay bricks with non-fired bricks and concrete blocks. To ensure quality of aggregates, regular testing should be carried out from a standard testing laboratory. After completion of the Reinforced Concrete (RC) frame of a building, finishing works are done using different construction materials.  To ensure durability, those materials should also be of good quality. We should always keep in mind that quality materials and appropriate construction method ensures construction of a safe and durable building. A few finishing construction materials are briefly described below: Clay bricks/ Concrete blocks. Fired clay bricks are predominantly used to construct walls in buildings in our country. Quality of bricks depends on the size, shape and degree of burning. As the fired clay bricks are not environ friendly, it should be gradually replaced with concrete blocks and non-fired bricks. Electrical Cables, Appliances, Safety Devices. Electrical short circuits are the main reason for fire disasters. And the happenings of short circuits are due to poor quality cables, appliances and safety devices. To avoid fire hazards due to short circuits, the electrical design and construction supervision should be done by a qualified and experienced electrical engineer. Finally, it may be concluded that, as building construction is an engineering job and the investment is large and for long term, services of qualified and experienced engineers should be taken to construct buildings which will be comfortable, user friendly, safe and durable.

      "text": "Since the 80s of last century, fish farmers and entrepreneurs started commercial fish farming. Before that time, they merely had any idea about farming fish and getting financial benefit out of it. Many later took to fish farming and turned it into a profitable enterprise. People from different classes and professions joined in and they have made this sector one of the most enriched one by now. Many others are following, being inspired by success stories and programmes on the fish cultivation methods on the TV and newspapers. In the 90s, farmers started fish farming in seasonal flood plains. Comilla's Daudkandi has been a revolution for this model of fish farming. In course of time, thousands of farmers have got involved with this new approach. Many of you have already watched this on Hridoye Mati O Manush. After Comilla, for the past one decade in the floodplains of Narsingdi's Shibpur, fish farming has spread, specifically in Bilshoron. Lands here usually stay under water for five to six months. Only natural fish used to arrive here in the past. Now, the same area sees revolution in fish farming, giving a great mileage for the fish farmers and entrepreneurs.   Thousands of tonnes of fishes are produced as over a hundred fish farming projects, small and big, are working in the floodplain in Narsingdi. As per the district fisheries office the projection of production has become almost double in couple of years. Bilshoron is such a remarkable fish hub, actually a majestic floodplain, blessed with different varieties of fishes. Some great entrepreneurs have taken lease of 120 bighas of low water land and farming indigenous and foreign fish varieties. The main entrepreneur behind this project is Jewel Karim Bhuyian. Jewel has four brothers and all of them are highly educated and involved in fish farming. They are producing fish on around 300 bighas of land in Narsingdi, Netrakona and Sylhet. \"Fish farming is in our blood and this has turned into our main family business for the past two decades,\" says Jewel. Under this project on the floodplains, Jewel and his brothers are producing around 800 tonnes of fish. They've already spent Tk 9 crore behind all their leased floodplains across the country. So far Jewel could make yearly 20% profit of their total investment. As the profit is on the rise, Jewel and his brothers have extended the area of fish farming. \"Starting with only seven bighas of floodplains, we have extended fish farming area to hundreds of bighas of such lands,\" confidently adds Jewel. Their diligence and perseverance have given them good returns. They believe if the government can bring in new strategies and technologies, it will definitely add a new dimension in their objective and there will be an even bigger boom. The five brothers have also started experimental layer farm on large cages set over their leased floodplains. This technology is although an old one, but chicken drops are going into the water as fish feed. And, the two thousand layer chickens are giving Jewel and his brothers around 1700 to 1800 eggs daily on an average. Jewel has really proved his skill about pond management. They are making sure that the floodplain water is clean and bacteria cannot infect the fish. These are the most significant issues that one entrepreneur should keep in mind before putting a duck, chicken or even a rabbit farm over floodplain or ponds. \"We have further plans to make chicken farms over all our floodplains,\" says Muhib Hasan Bhuiyan, brother of Jewel. People who own these lands also believe that by giving lease they are now doing much better than before. In the past, these lands used to stay under water without any output. \"The entire development scenario of this region has changed,\" said Monir Hossain, a local from Shibpur. These floodplains are not only contributing to the development of livelihood but also ensuring fresh fish for the consumers around the region. Many people have got employments in the project. Right now as per the fisheries department account, fish is being cultivated on 430 hectares of floodplains in Narsingdi. But the locals believe it can spread and become more profitable, if the right plan and government focus is there to promote this kind of new venture or entrepreneurship. Dear readers, our fish used to come from natural resources in the past. Fish farming was a rare scene during that time. Now the days have changed and approaches towards doing something new with positive effect have changed along with it. Bangladesh now stands fourth in producing sweet water fish. And, I must say floodplain fish farming has been a revolution for sure in the positive movement of producing more fish. Millions of people have joined in this process with their heartfelt efforts and labour. They strived for more and now the good results are coming. I strongly believe an absolutely planned fish farming strategy will give Bangladesh even greater success and achievement in near future."

      "text": "Though sufficient areas as water retention pond is necessary for reducing waterlogging and flood management through flood protection embankment, the retention areas of the western part is reducing fast due to a lack of proper initiatives by the government. During construction of the 36km western embankment, three permanent pump stations, Kallyanpur, Goran Chatbari and Dholaikhal, were set up with retentions ponds, which have reduced over the years due to negligence. A retention basin is used to manage storm water runoff to prevent flooding and downstream erosion, and improve water quality in an adjacent river, stream, lake or bay. Moreover, lack of an efficient storm sewer system also contributes to the reduction of water carrying capacity, causing waterlogging, drainage congestion and other hazards throughout the monsoons. These constraints have to be identified and to reduce the capital's flood vulnerability it is essential to protect and preserve flood retention ponds, said experts. Retention pond at Goran Chatbari pump station is comparatively in a better condition though 40 acres of land have been reduced recently due to the construction work of an elevated expressway. Dholaikhal pump station has also lost its retention area due to the construction of a box culvert in the 90s by Dhaka City Corporation. According to experts at least 105 acres of regulatory pond areas are necessary for the pumping station at Dholai Khal, which has now only 3.5 acres. There are three pumps at the station with a 7.4 cumec (cubic metre per second) capacity each. In Kallyanpur pump station the retention area is under the risk of being encroached if Wasa does not go for its ownership soon as the government has failed to acquire lands over the last 25 years. In a study report in 1990, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) suggested setting up a pumping station with a capacity of 20 cumec in the area, and keeping 514 acres of land for regulating ponds. But the government has acquired only around 57 acres of land so far. The city's waterlogging situation is worsening due to a rapid growth of unplanned urbanisation at many parts of the reserved areas. The government on the other hand is continuously reducing its land acquiring targets and now they are completely out of the land acquisition process. Two pump stations were set up with the grant of Jica at the station, having capacity of 10 cumec each in 1993 and 2010. Jica's requirement was to create a regulatory pond on 514 acres of land initially and it was reduced to 227 acres later. But the government failed to acquire land showing fund shortage. It would have been possible to acquire the total land initially using only Tk 50 crore but now it is a matter of big amount of money, said a Wasa official. Wasa now has 171 acres of land under their control -- 57 acres acquired, 98.35 of Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC), 9.71 of canal land of Wasa and 11.4 khas land. Wasa is using the BADC land for 3 months (August to October) as a regulatory pond and the rest of the months BADC is using it as their seed beds following a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between them. But these lands are also under threat of encroachment. The pump station and its regulating pond area are important as water of the areas including a large part of Mirpur, Kallaynpur, Rokeya Sarani, Kazipara, Shewrapara, Agargaon, Sangsad Bhaban area, Mohammadpur, Rayerbazar, Satmasjid Road and BDR area gathers there, which is then pumped out to the Buriganga river, said a Wasa official. The waterlogging will worsen if around 227 acres of land are not kept reserved as retention areas, many of which are now under threat of grabbing, he said. Prof Emeritus of Brac University Ainun Nishat, a water resources and climate change specialist, said the reservoir should be kept according to its plan to get proper benefits. If the regulating areas are reduced, then it will be necessary to increase the pumping capacity, otherwise the areas around the pond will inundate, he said. He said many areas from where water comes to the pond through different canals will also be inundated if it is not pumped out properly. Meanwhile, the Executive Committee of National Economic Council at a meeting on January 19, 2000 approved about Tk 82.66 crore project to acquiring 269.78 acres of land (152.70acre private land, 117.08acre of BADC and some others organisations' land) and fixed the implementing time from June 1998 to 2001. Advertisements were also published in newspapers on August 20, 2000 by authorities concerned requesting people not to construct any house or structures on the 270 acres of low land areas under the project. But unplanned urbanisation has been going on unabated there, sources said. The land ministry on February 7, 2002 cancelled the acquiring process due to the expiration of the scheduled time of section 5(1) of land acquisition, said a Wasa official. Later the government decided to implement the retention area on around 227 acres of land (private land 101.28 acres, BADC 98.35 acres, Water Development Board 6.36 acres, Wasa 9.7 acres and khas land 11.4 acres) Wasa on January 25, 2006, again requested the ministry to acquire 116.02 acres of land (104.62acre private and 11.4acre khas) to implement the second phase of the Kallyanpur pump station, he said, adding that the ministry on February 11, 2007, finally approved to acquire 112.68 acres of land (101acre private land). But it was also not done at that time as a committee again suggested reducing the regulating area and only around 57 acres were acquired due to a fund shortage and decided to acquire the rest around 56 acres in the second phase. Later on July 11, 2013, in a meeting of Economic Relations Division, a decision was taken to construct the regulatory pond on 171  acres of land (BADC 98.35 acres, Water Development Board 6.36 acres, Wasa 9.7 acres and acquired 57 acres) leaving the process of acquiring 56.19 acres. Institute of Water Modelling then carried out a study, and suggested setting up another pump having a capacity of 16 cumec to continue the retention areas on 171 acres of land. It also suggested evicting illegal grabbers from the pond area, excavating the pond to increase its capacity and the canal mouths and setting up boundaries for its proper utilisation. Wasa later prepared a Development Project Proforma (DPP) following the decision, which was supposed to be implemented by July 2015 to June 2018. Later, following another decision at a government meeting, Wasa is again preparing to re-submit the DPP. In Goran Chatbari pumping station, there was only one pumping station with a capacity of 22 cumec. Later in 2010-15, another 22 cumec capacity pump was set up by reducing the marshy lands for the construction of the Rajuk's Uttara third phase, said a Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) official. But BWDB is setting up another pump there having a capacity of 22 cumec as the BWDB handed over 40 acres of land from its retention area to the road transport and bridges ministry to construct the elevated expressway. An IWM study suggested setting up another pump with a 22 cumec capacity to meet the deficit of 40 acres of land from the retention area, said Abul Kamal Azad, chief engineer (central zone) of BWDB. The ministry will bear the cost from the elevated expressway project and have already started setting up the pump and handed over the land to them, he said, adding, an MoU was signed between the two sides on September 21, 2016. Total retention area of Goran Chatbari is 676 acres (273hectare) from where they have handed over the 40 acres of land, he said. Prof Nishat said that keeping a retention pond in front of every pump station is a must. Though it was planned to keep more areas as retention pond for Goran Chatbari, it was not done due to the pressure of influential people, he alleged. The areas kept as retention ponds are being protected with huge hurdles, he said. Nishat said there is no regulatory pond in front of the Kallyanpur pump station, as Wasa does not have the ownership of the pond area. They are increasing the capacity of the pumping station but if the situation continues, the station will lose its effectiveness by the next 10 to 15 years, he warned. Though it was the suggestion of a high powered committee of the government in 1989 formed after the 1988 flood, to purchase the land, it was not implemented, he added."

      "text": "Several thousand Bangladeshis who are currently visiting India are left high and dry after New Delhi's shock move to withdraw Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bank notes from circulation. In a bid to crack down on corruption, counterfeit currency and tax evasion, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a special address to the nation on Tuesday evening announced that 500- and 1,000-rupee notes would become invalid from midnight. The move has put Indians and travelling Bangladeshis alike in a state of colossal inconvenience as retailers from restaurants to pharmacies and hospitals refused to accept the bills. \"We should be able to make the sacrifice of adjusting to such a move in national interest as it aims to tackle the evils of corruption, black money, fake currency and terrorism,\" Modi said in his address. The Daily Star spoke to six visiting Bangladeshis, who shared their unforeseen plight as a result of the sudden measure. Take, for instance, Mukul Hasan, who hails from Narayanganj. He recently underwent a bypass surgery in a hospital in Kolkata and returned on Tuesday for follow-up examinations. He had brought US dollars with him, which he exchanged for Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations as soon as he arrived in Kolkata. Following Modi's announcement later in the day, Hasan found himself in trouble: he cannot even change his large denomination notes for new bills of 500 and 2,000 rupees that will be issued today. The Indian government has announced that Indian citizens can get their Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes changed from banks and post offices between November 11 and December 30 by showing their Indian national ID cards. In short, foreign tourists have no way to change their currencies into smaller denominations. Kunal Sarker, a cardiologist at Medica Hospital in Kolkata, acknowledged that Bangladeshi patients have been facing problems due to the ban on large bank notes.   Though hospitals and petrol stations were supposed to accept the large bills until November 11, Reuters reported that they have stopped doing so. Mamun Miah from Chittagong, who is accompanying his ailing mother for treatment in Bengaluru, told The Daily Star by phone on Tuesday night that even the hospitals are not accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.  Madhab Saha, a money changer at Petrapole border, said the Indian government's decision has come as a bolt from the blue to Bangladeshi tourists.  As Bangladeshi tourists prefer to bring in Bangladeshi taka over US dollar, they end up with large denominations of the Indian currency for convenience. Currency exchange has remained on pause since Tuesday night after Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were scrapped. \"The money changers have no alternative but to give out bigger Indian notes. With them being invalid now, it is not possible do any currency conversions,\" he added. When contacted, Bangladesh Deputy High Commissioner Zaki Ahad said it is a decision of the Indian government, so there is nothing the foreign mission can do. To be effective, the move had to be unexpected, but it was also fraught with problems for an economy largely fuelled by cash, especially for India's poorest citizens, many of whom work in the large rural economy, Reuters said. Deepak Chhatoi, a salesman at a car varnishing store in Mumbai, told Reuters he had to turn away customers wanting to pay with larger bills, and could not buy the popular potato sandwich known as vada pav. \"I couldn't even have breakfast this morning because there seems to be a shortage of change in the market. The vada pav seller declined to sell to me because he did not have change,\" he added. Delhi taxi driver Anu Choudhury told Reuters that his boss called to say he should not accept 500 or 1,000 rupee notes from customers. \"This is not a good step for business. The prime minister did not think about people like us.\" Meanwhile, bank ATMs were closed yesterday as banks prepared for the flood of people seeking to change larger banknotes for smaller ones from today. Swapan Mandal, a labourer, wanted to withdraw Rs 3,000 from a cash machine and send it to his family in Kolkata, but was unable to do so. \"I have only 500 rupees notes at home. I don't know if I will be able to send the money,\" he told Reuters. A sub-inspector in New Delhi said the police commissioner had issued orders to watch for disturbances, especially at key retail outlets like petrol pumps. \"This is a sensitive time. We have to be alert,\" he told Reuters. The sizeable population of non-resident Indians too is in a precarious position as a result of the move. In Hong Kong's Chungking Mansions, home to more than a dozen money changers and a key hub for Indian businesses and traders, the Indian rupee found no takers, with several currency dealers displaying \"0.00\" on their counters. Yesterday morning, more than the usual number of Indian customers turned up frantically looking to exchange their Indian bank notes, according to local money changers. Gurpreet Kaur, a Hong Kong resident of Indian origin who was trying to convert about Rs 50,000 ($748), was disappointed after seven money changers refused to accept the 500 rupee bank notes she presented. \"This is really frustrating and we had no time to act,\" she said, as she walked out of the dimly-lit building. One forex trader at Hong Kong-based money-changing chain Singapore Exchange Co said his firm was left with Rs 10 million ($150,000) in cash. \"We don't know what to do. We are frantically trying to find buyers and sell at any cost. But there are no takers yet,\" said one of the clerks, who gave his name only as Yunus. The clerk said he had been inundated with phone calls from the first hour yesterday from nervous customers left holding stashes of Indian bank notes. It was a similar story in Singapore, another Asian financial centre with a sizeable Indian community, with people holding rupees and unable to exchange them into other currencies. The two financial centres are home to around 400,000 residents of Indian origin, mostly engaged in diamond and textiles trading or working in the financial and construction industries. Mihir Sharma, a Bloomberg View columnist, said while a shortage of currency might well make it harder to hide from the taxman, it will also make things much tougher for small businesses and for the poor. \"India's a far-flung economy that lives in many centuries at once, and ATM cards or mobile payments may not have percolated far enough. There will probably be a price to be paid in efficiency -- and the poor will pay a disproportionate share of that price.\" Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party came into power in 2014 promising to bring black market money into the regular financial system, but critics said it had failed, with government data showing the cash economy outpacing the formal economy. A report by Washington-based think-tank Global Financial Integrity estimated that India lost $344 billion in illicit fund outflows between 2002 and 2011."

      "text": "Two years ago Jo Milne became an internet sensation when footage of her hearing for the first time appeared on YouTube. Since then she has rekindled a long-lost friendship, enlisted the support of 1970s pop group The Osmonds and travelled to Bangladesh to help hundreds of deaf children. More than 10m people shared the moment when Jo Milne, who was born deaf, heard for the first time at the age of 39. She had been fitted with cochlear implants and the footage of her tears of joy on hearing a nurse read to her went viral. Amid the flood of well-wishers was a long-lost friend - Amina Khan. Jo had known her since she was 11 but, when Amina married at 16 and moved away to Bangladesh, the pair lost touch. They had formed a close bond because they were both \"different\", Amina said. Her family was the only Asian one on their Gateshead estate and Jo was deaf.\n\"It was a special bond because we were different and there was a little bit of bullying going on,\" she said. \"It was always a warm and friendly place, but there were some spiteful kids. \"But we were so close we didn't even realise. We were in our own little world.\" They had plans for their future, too. \"As we were growing up we always used to say to each other that one day we would try to help the poor children of Bangladesh,\" said Amina. Support for the pair's plans came from an unlikely source - The Osmonds, six brothers from Utah who formed a band with the intention of making money for their deaf elder brothers. Members of the band had seen Jo's video and were so moved they got in touch to ask her to be an ambassador for their charity, the Hearing Fund UK. Two years later she turned to them for the contacts she needed to transform a vague childhood promise into reality. Jo said 5% of children in Bangladesh - 1.2m - are deaf. The plan was to fit 500 of them with hearing aids in the space of two days. Simply boosting sound, aids are a more basic solution than the cochlear implants Jo had fitted - electronic devices that replace the function of the damaged inner ear, sending sound signals to the brain. Jo travelled to Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh where Amina lives, to film the life-changing clinics. The \"hustle and bustle\" of one of the most congested cities in the world was a shock to Jo's newly revived sense of hearing. \"I was looking this way and that - I've never known so much traffic, so many people,\" she said. As the day of the first clinic dawned, the queue outside grew longer and longer.\nDespite being highly planned with lots of volunteers, the sheer number of people needing help meant families waiting for hours in the intense Dhaka heat. For hearing aids to be fitted, the ears need to be perfectly clean so many of the youngsters had to have theirs cleaned before moulds were made. Once the aid was fitted the volume was gradually turned up to reach the right level. \"Watching their eyes light up, they are all reacting differently to hearing sound,\" Jo said. \"Some having a quiet reaction others crying. Watching them turning from left to right reacting to sound is amazing.\"\nThe hearing aids worked for most, but not all, of the children. Rokaya Begum, whose two sons and daughter had them fitted, said: \"My children can hear me and have conversations - it doesn't get much better.\" Sixteen-year-old Morium said she could hear the pigeons. \"They sound good,\" she said. Her mother said it would mean she could get an education and job and be able to look after her parents. To eventually see their dream of helping children in her home country come true had been \"a very emotional journey\" for them both, Amina said. \"I couldn't have done it alone,\" Jo said. \"There were so many children involved.\" The hearing aids \"had broken down all those isolating barriers,\" she said.\nFor Jo, the chance to see the children's reactions is priceless. Despite regaining her hearing, her disorder - Usher syndrome - means she is now losing her sight. She compares her diminishing vision to looking at the world \"through a letterbox\". \"It was a thought provoking visit - being deaf is a very isolating condition anyway,\" she added. \"The stigma surrounding deafness is a world-wide issue. \"But there are thousands and thousands of children like Morium. \"At the end of the day it is a hearing world and hearing aids have enabled me to be a part of it. \"This has been a humbling experience, but it's not over - there are so many more children that I want to reach.\""

      "text": "Familiar to generations of Bangladeshi school-goers, 'A Journey by Boat' is a common passage and essay topic. But in Sunamganj these days it's more than an abstract lesson. In around 90 villages of 3 upazilas, for students and the community at large, boat is currently the only means of transport. As a result of the rainy season and perilous flooding, boats have been selling like hot cakes in Sunamganj over the past few weeks, and not all are especially seaworthy. Yet, anticipating that floodwaters will not recede any time soon, boats are popular.  \"We can't use the Nabinagar - Sunamganj Road,\" says rickshaw puller Munim Ali from Nabinagar village in sadar upazila. \"It's been devoured by the river. We have to travel by boat.\" \"We haven't been able to attend class for six days,\" says Class VIII student Sohag Islam, of Elahi Box High School in Tahirpur upazila, \"because our school is across the river and it's difficult to cross.\" Surma River boatman Mojnu meanwhile says he and his colleagues are reaping good profits due to high water levels. \"When water is low we lose money,\" he says. But customers are not pleased. \"We are forced to pay hiked boat fares,\" complains one passenger, Mobrul Hosain from Tahirpur upazila. \"We have no alternative to reach Sunamganj town.\" Another passenger agrees. \"The boatmen often misbehave if anyone refuses to pay their increased fares,\" says Sirazul Islam from Doarabazar upazila. \"I have used this route regularly for the last 3 years but even I do not escape harassment for higher ticket prices.\" But there is no alternative, he adds. According to Sirazul, some villagers are calling for the establishment of a government sponsored boat service until the water recedes, but there has been no response from the government. Doarabazar upazila chairman M Idris Ali says 5 unions in the upazila have been forced to rely on boats as transport for the past week or so. \"Anybody going to office, school or college or for business purpose must use a boat,\" he says, \"If government sponsored services were available fares could be kept in check to the benefit of locals.\" The upazila nirbahi officer of Tahirpur upazila, Mohammad Khaledur Rahman says such a government sponsored initiative isn't easy to implement but if locals demand it the administration must take action. The cost of inflated fares is particularly onerous on the poor, who previously travelled on foot. \"To reach Sunamganj sadar from Doarabazar town now costs at least Tk 100,\" says NGO staffer Sajal Rozirio. For some who cannot afford such \"luxury\" the only option is to choose makeshift vessels made from bamboo sticks or banana trees. Many locals also blame the Water Development Board for the crisis, alleging it has not taken any action to reduce or control the floodwaters. The board's deputy divisional engineer Dipok Kumar Das says a lack of funds is impeding their efforts to take effective flood control measures. But he hoped the situation would improve if the government allocates funds for the purpose. Barrister Enamul Haque Imon who works for the Sunamganj district administration says, however, that higher authorities have been informed about the issue. He further alleges that the Water Development Board's inaction has less to do with a lack of funds and more to do with fund mismanagement and corruption. Perhaps along with the poor those who suffer the most are students. According to district primary education officer in Sunamganj, Hazrat Ali, during a recent field visit he observed most students only had the option of boat if they wanted to attend class. \"The Jadukata, Cholti, Surma Rivers and Tanguar Haor continue to swell,\" he says. \"It's really risky for students since most of the boats that carry them are not at all seaworthy vessels.\" For now the students and general public of Sunamganj are learning a new lesson: while in the textbook 'A Journey by Boat' might be a curiosity, in reality it's all too often burdensome."

Yes, the man, also a famous musician, is George Harrison (Feb 25, 1943 - Nov 29, 2001).  Harrison is long remembered for his contribution to the Bangladesh War of Liberation in 1971. When his friend, the great Sitar maestro Ravi Sankar, approached him asking for help for a flood and war ravaged Bangladesh, Harrison, also known as the \"shy Beatle\" decided to organise the Concert for Bangladesh at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Harrison later immortalised in the song \"Bangla Desh\" with which he would close both the concerts: \"My friend came to me, with sadness in his eyes Told me that he wanted help, before his country dies Although I couldn't feel the pain, I knew I had to try Now I'm asking all of you, to help us save some lives...\" Harrison later said (in his autobiography I Me Mine) \"So I did get involved, and for three months I was on the telephone sitting up what became the concert for Bangla Desh, trying to talk people into it, talking to Eric and all those people who did do it.\" \"He had an emotional attachment to Bangladesh,\" said Olivia Harrison, whom Harrison first met in 1974 and married in 1978. \"Ravi was very distressed... which George could not ignore,\" said Olivia describing how Harrison conceived the historic concert in Madison Square Garden, New York. \"He [George] was in very deep water. It was only a year after his band [the Beatles] had disbanded. He was in the middle of a recording... He felt that his part of contribution [to the cause of Bangladesh] was music.\" He invited his famous rock star friends to participate, including Bob Dylan, won the Nobel Prize for Literature this year, and Eric Clapton, and the concert was a resounding success that not only got global attention for a South Asian Nation, it also became an amazing example for large scale big name benefits. His rockabilly-influenced playing gave the Beatles' early recordings their distinctive guitar-driven sound and his voice provided many of the group's most arresting vocal harmonies. His fascination with Eastern music also helped broaden the band's sound on such classic albums as \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and \"The White Album.\" Although overshadowed by the more prolific songwriters Lennon and McCartney, Harrison composed several of the Beatles' finest songs, including \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" \"Here Comes the Sun,\" \"Something\" and \"Within You, Without You.\" Following the group's breakup in 1970, he enjoyed a successful solo career that included such albums as \"All Things Must Pass,\" \"The Concert For Bangladesh,\" \"Cloud Nine\" and \"Brainwashed.\" In the late 1980s and early '90,s he collaborated with Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison and Jeff Lynne in the whimsical musical super group The Traveling Wilburys. Harrison is immortal for his lifelong contribution to music and humanity. "

      "text": "In the context of the changing global environment and socio-political and economic conditions of Bangladesh, agricultural development of the country and its sustainability deserve active government-private partnership. A comprehensive agricultural development action plan is required to face the challenges of feeding growing population. Appropriate marketing system development is also required to ensure price support to the growers at the same time price of the essential commodities should be within the purchasing power of low-income group of the society. First attempt will be to increase and stabilise production of selected essential commodities through maximum utilisation of land, water and human resources of the country. In subsequent attempts, the country can plan for value addition to the products and for commercial agriculture, which have been started at limited scale but need expansion. Cost of production of major crops is high in Bangladesh and power use in agriculture is low compared to even neighbouring countries. Furthermore, whatever is produced, a bulk of it is lost after harvesting (post harvest losses). Therefore, efficient use of irrigation water, effective use of irrigation facilities, use of machine for agricultural operation and saving/minimising post harvest losses are required to make agriculture cost effective in Bangladesh. In this article, possible contribution of water management for agricultural development will be discussed. Discussion on agricultural mechanisation and processing may be undertaken if opportunities arise. Water availability situation over the year compels Bangladesh to address issues like irrigation, flood control and drainage, which are contradictory in nature. For example, Bangladesh receives annually about 7.5 meters of water, 5.5 meters from surface flow and 2 meters from rainfall. About 90% of the huge water volume is available during June to September each year and remaining 10% is received during October to May. Therefore, water environment forces Bangladesh for irrigated agriculture supported by flood control measures and provision of drainage facilities. With the water potential of the country, about 76% of the cultivable area can be irrigated of which about 64% are presently under irrigation. Due to fluctuation in availability and lack of control over surface water, about 79% of the irrigated area use groundwater. Major constraints to face for irrigation, flood control and drainage systems development and operation are; lack of continuity in policy supports, withdrawal of surface water at upstream, lack of timely availability of fuel, oil and electricity for smooth operation of irrigation systems, funds and interest for maintenance of flood control, drainage and irrigation (FCDI) systems. Water management is a critical issue in Bangladesh for about two to two and half months (Mid February to April). During this period of the year, - Water Table goes below suction limit (> 8 meter) - Arsenic concentration exceeds safe limit, >0.05 parts per million (ppm) - Soil salinity in coastal area increases beyond crop tolerance level (> 4 mmohs/cm or 4 dS/m) - Surface water sources especially smaller rivers, and low lying areas (beels) become dry. Therefore, comprehensive plans and implementation methods should be practiced to address water management related issues. Sustainable agricultural development and improved livelihood will be possible if land and water resources of the country are used judiciously. This will require taking advantages of improved technology available in the country or adapted from abroad after adaptive trials. It has been observed over several years that both tube wells using groundwater and large-scale canal irrigation systems in most parts of the country are operating at lower than 50% of their efficiency level. Experiences indicate that over all irrigation efficiency levels of tube wells and canal irrigation systems can easily be increased to 75% and 70% respectively. That means another about 25% area can be brought under irrigation with existing irrigation infrastructures. Therefore, performance improvement of existing irrigations systems can be one of the ways of making the systems cost effective. Concern about water management\n Recently, much concern is being expressed about need for improving performance of irrigation systems. However, it is not new as irrigation systems are operated with low efficiency since beginning of irrigation in Bangladesh. Over the years, terminologies changed from Thana irrigation program (TIP) in early 1960s to water management during early 1970s, to on-farm water management (during late 1970s and 1980s), to improved water management (during early 1990s), to participatory water management (since late 1990s) and to the recent integrated water resources management (IWRM). In real sense there have not been any significant improvements in water management and efficient use of water resources. It is believed that there have been changes of terminology but not much in utilisation level of water resources and its management since late fifties to date. To understand it and to establish status of water management, let us see how water management is defined: The most comprehensive definition of water management compared to general definition of management can be explained using the definitions. Management in a comprehensive way has been defined as \"the process and activity of carrying out the task so that a number of diverse activities are performed in such a way that defined objective is achieved by the combined efforts of a group of people (French and Saward, 1975).\" The term water management has different meanings to different people. Water is often considered to be free commodity; therefore, its management also varies. To me water management defined by Alvin Bishop is very relevant to our subject of discussion and he defined it as \"Water management is a combination of science and art that requires application of knowledge of water, soil, climate, crops, and their interactions together with inputs and management for agricultural production\". As professionals of this field let us ask ourselves, are we using our water resources and doing water management in our country that meets the criteria set in the above definition? Probably not! We could achieve a lot through improved water management by achieving the development potentials. Some of the improvement potentials could be achieved without additional investment at least for infrastructure development. Infrastructure development For protecting lives and properties of the people, FCDI facilities are essential. During infrastructure development for providing FCDI facilities, construction of embankments and irrigation and drainage canals are required. These infrastructures are mostly used for saving lives and properties and creating favourable environment for increasing agricultural production. Multiple uses of these facilities for afforestation and fish cultivation in addition to their primary uses will make them more cost effective. How the situation can be improved Irrigation personnel should be trained to use FCDI facilities and associated infrastructures for their best use. It will require active participation of the stakeholders/beneficiaries., which includes partnership among beneficiaries and government agencies, but responsibility of project implementation lies with implementing agencies. Participatory management and more specifically participatory water management in water sector projects are widely discussed now-a -days. Under present condition, government agencies are still the main player and beneficiaries are consulted for their opinion and expected assigned roles by the implementing agency or agencies. To be more specific, so far one of the agencies, which has been assigned responsibility of project implementation and operating funding arrangement for the development works become \"captain\" in the implementation team. Beneficiaries are expected to be good listeners and to follow directions of the captain.  In real sense, beneficiaries should be the decision makers while agency personnel, researchers and NGOs engaged in development activities in the project area would work as advisors. Other important deviations from common thinking is that, in most FCDI projects, activities related to management, operation and maintenance (MOM) of flood control, drainage and irrigation infrastructures although not addressed properly, get all the importance by the project management. Other components like, efficient use of water, crop production, fish, forest and livestock production are not getting due importance. Improvements of these aspects are left with the concerned line agencies and beneficiaries of the project area. However, multiple and integrated use of the FCDI projects and integrated water resources management (IWRM) should be the priority areas for water sector projects. Few examples are cited in this respect to emphasise and elaborate difference of the concept from the existing operational procedures. Guidelines for Participatory Water Management (GPWM) in Bangladesh states that \"Participation is an important voluntary process in which local stakeholders influence policy formulation, alternative plans/designs, investment choices and management decisions affecting their communities and establish the sense of ownership\".  The GPWM indicate that \"Give the local stakeholders a decisive voice at all stages of water management\". The co-management concept validated through a case study supports decision - making power than the decisive voice. The GPWM also supports participation of local stakeholders to \"prepare production plans on agriculture, fishery, forestry and livestock development and environmental management plan based on the feasibility study\" by the implementing agencies. In real life, the implementing agencies, BWDB and LGED are not doing these as existing government mandates entitles Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), Forest Department (FD), Department of Fisheries (DOF) and Livestock Department (LOD) to prepare their plan of action for the country including water sector project areas. Co-management and participatory management support that mere participation in decision-making and consultation by agency personnel in water sector projects will not bring much benefit to the stakeholders. For increasing agricultural production, which is required for improved livelihood of stakeholders and for effective land and water resources in irrigation projects, stakeholders should have authority of decision--making for management of all infrastructures. Proposals agreed upon by the stakeholders should be implemented to achieve maximum benefit from the investment made in implementing irrigation projects and building infrastructure. Action plans should be developed to emphasise on how water environment of the country can be managed to make positive influence on health, food availability and intake of nutrients and mitigate negative impact on these issues. Few examples of such action plan are: * Conservation of excess water received during rainy season and effective use of rainwater and infrastructure developed so far can play important role in improving water availability in dry season, if comprehensive use of the facilities are ensured. Improved management at local and national levels through government and social interventions can solve the problem. * Irrigation or water resources development of the country should be different for different agro-ecological regions of Bangladesh. The national development plan should be to maximise utilisation of rainfall, surface and ground water through conjunctive use of these resources. Comprehensive studies should be undertaken at the upazila level involving stakeholders, government and non-government organisations (NGOs) working with agriculture, soil and water based development programs for developing and implementing local level production plan.  Several studies indicate that improvements are possible for increasing annual crop production, increasing irrigation/water use efficiency and improving livelihood of farmers. * Irrigation in Bangladesh at present is not cost effective. Over the years, number of deep and shallow tube wells and LLPs has increased, but area coverage per unit of these facilities has not increased rather decreased.  This issue may be reviewed by practicing professionals and means for improvement should be developed. It is required to increase irrigation efficiency, increase service area of irrigation units, and minimise water distribution loss by adopting location specific appropriate techniques. *Low water demanding crops during dry season may be cultivated for minimising irrigation cost during dry season in highly permeable area. Low water demanding crops like wheat, pulses and oil seeds may be cultivated in place of high water demanding crops like Boro (rice) if the economic return and farmers demands permit. Research findings proved this hypothesis effective through several researches out puts. Alternate wetting and drying Studies conducted in Bangladesh on alternate wetting and drying (AWD) since late 1970s and case studies conducted recently confirmed that AWD has been accepted in Bangladesh as an important water management technology for irrigated rice cultivation. It is a proven technology for water management, where water can be saved compared to flood irrigation for rice cultivation without yield reduction. In fact, yield under AWD is higher compared to maintaining continuous standing water in rice fields. Moreover, it saves irrigation water, reduces cost of irrigation and thereby cost of production. Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has accepted this technology as part of policy document for \"Integrated Small Scale Irrigation Policy\". The GOB advised agencies involved in irrigation management and development to adopt AWD method for irrigation of rice cultivation during Boro season as on an average it saves; five numbers of irrigations against about 25 irrigations required for standing water treatment and about 20% of irrigation water, which is about 600 litters of water for producing one kg of paddy. Adoption of AWD technique increase rice production by about 0.5 ton/ha and increase water productivity by 1.0 kg/ha/mm. It also saves fuel consumption by 23% and reduce cost of rice production by Taka 6000/ha. However, adoption of AWD requires one additional weeding compared to maintaining standing water in rice fields. Bangladesh has created facilities for 5.40 Mha of irrigated (MOA, as of June 2014) and 6.14 Mha (reported by BWDB, as of June 2013) of flood control, drainage and irrigation (FCDI) area. Water potential permits irrigation development up to 6.55 Mha by 2025 and 7.45 Mha to the maximum (Water Resources Planning Organisation, WARPO, 2000). Therefore, about 6 Mha may easily be planned for year-round crop production through effective use of FCDI facilities. About 10 tons/ha of grain can be harvested in the FCDI area per year adopting available technology. Therefore, the country can produce 60 million tons of food grain (paddy + other grains + pulses) from the FCDI area, which may be about 45 million tons of net grain production (rice + other grains). This production target can be achieved adopting available research and management technology through integrated land and water management and adopting agricultural mechanisation. About 2 million hectares remaining even under traditional cultivation (which is not practical in the developing world, therefore, improved cultivation may be practiced) will make the country surplus in food production. However, it will require co-ordinated efforts for improved water management, use of mechanical power in agriculture, post-harvest technology, processing, and improved storage for favourable returns to the farmers.

      "text": " One of Md Aslam's favourite pastimes was to spend time with his father near the bank of Dholai Khal. The father and son duo used to sit together in the afternoon, enjoy fresh air and watch boats gently glide over the canal. \"It was a huge canal even in the 70s,\" recollected an excited Aslam, a businessman in the capital's Dayaganj area. \"I even saw boat races with my father. I used to sit on his shoulder and count the boats,\" he smiled. There was also a ghat (landing spot) near the Dayaganj Noor mosque where many boats would come with goods, he pointed towards the spot. But the plying stopped in the middle of 80s and 90s as it was turned to a box culvert, Aslam sighed. Many joined Aslam and expressed exasperation as it is extremely difficult to recognise the canal anymore, not even a fleeting glimpse of the once mighty Dholai Khal remains. Just a railway bridge at Dayaganj bearing a sign of the canal stands alone. Md Sohrab Hossain, a resident of Dakkhin Mushindi, recalled that the canals had a fresh flow of water till 1975 and they used to catch fish there. As the canals were interlinked and used to flow into rivers, people could travel by boats easily, he said. \"We used to jump into the canal from the bridge,\" said a nostalgic Shafiqul Islam, a resident of Gendaria. Around a dozen of the city's canals have either been filled up entirely or turned into box culverts to construct roads, aggravating the waterlogging problems. The concept of box culvert came after the 1988 flood when most of the city came under waterlogging. A high powered committee of the government, formed at that time to mitigate the problem, submitted a report in 1989. After that in the 90s the construction of the box culverts and roads on the canals started significantly. Roads were constructed in Rayerbazar, Razabazar, Kathalbagan, Gopibagh, Shyampur Kadamtala and Maniknagar, filling up canals and constructing storm drainage and sewerage lines. Segunbagicha, Dholai Khal 1 and 2, Debdholai, Dhanmondi and Paribagh canals have been narrowed down for building box culverts. These covered water passages remain clogged due to lack of maintenance. Part of Dholpur canal was filled up for constructing a road while the rest was turned into a box culvert. A portion of Hazaribagh canal was filled up for a road, while the other portion is still open for water flow, said an official of Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Wasa). Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) and Wasa constructed the box culverts in the 90s and early this decade, said officials of two city corporations and Wasa. According to Wasa, a total length of box culverts constructed on different canals is 10.5km. Architect Iqbal Habib, joint secretary of Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon (Bapa), said construction of box culverts is completely wrong. These culverts remain clogged, as these are not cleaned up, resulting in water stagnation, he said. Prof Mujibur Rahman of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, in a presentation last year, said a box culvert is a hydraulically most inefficient flow channel and suggested removing them and returning the canals to their earlier state. Construction of box culverts usually results in gradual reduction of the flow as sedimentation continues due to a lack of regular maintenance, he explained. Box culverts are suitable only for places where fresh water flows through them and maintenance work is done regularly, he said, adding that unfortunately, waste water including human excreta goes through the box culverts of the city and the maintenance work is very irregular. An expert who worked in the drainage circle of Wasa for long said once there was a 200km canal network in the city and one could easily go to Sadarghat by boat from Gabtoli using different canals. He said these box culverts not only destroyed the network but also have become a headache for Wasa since they cannot clean them properly. Most of the portions of the box culverts remain filled with solid waste which reduces water carrying capacity, he said. \"If the authorities concerned clean the box culverts properly, the water logging problem of the city would reduce dramatically.\" Box culvert on Dayaganj canal. Photos: Zahed Khan\n The DCC turned Dholai Khal-1 and Dholai Khal-2 into box culverts during the 90s. Dholai Khal-2 used to flow into the Buriganga from Dayaganj Bazar via Sutrapur, Gendaria, Dayaganj, Wari and Shahar Dhaka Mouja while Dholai Khal-1 originated from Dholai Khal-2 and emptied into the Buriganga near the second Buriganga Bridge, said a Wasa official. It had links with Dholai Khal but DCC had turned it into a box culvert in 2004-2005. Mir Hajirbagh resident Faruk Hossain recalled that Debdholai canal had links with Dholai Khal and the Balu river through canals in Trimohoni. \"The canal was around 100 feet wide even around 17 years ago. It was gradually encroached upon. Many Mir Hajirbagh residents constructed buildings on it,\" he said. Wasa constructed a box culvert from Syedabad Bridge to Maniknagar Pukurpar and a road was built from Maniknagar Pukurpar to Rajarbagh on the canal in the 80s. Mohammad Babul, a resident of Maniknagar said the canal was turned to a pipe drain as a road was constructed from Model School to Manik Nagar Pukurpar, which is connected with Sayedabad road. The water of the canal was very clean around 20 years back and people used to catch fish there, he said. The canal had a link with the jheel (a reach of an old river channel bed) behind Bangladesh Bank in Motijheel, said sexagenarian Jahangir Alam, a resident of RK Mission road. The canal was turned to a road in the 90s, he said. The jheel was huge and had a link with Segunbagicha and Arambagh canals. Many people used to come to Motijheel using boats, said Mokhles Mia, a boatman of the jheel, which now exists like a pond behind Bangladesh Bank. Still many are using the pond as a short cut and to save 10 to 15 minutes to go to Motijheel from Kamalapur spending Tk 2, he said. \"We 11 boatmen are involved with the boats on the ponds who can earn collectively Tk 4,000 to Tk 4,500 per day. Earning was better when there were canals and jheels in the area and even people from far off places like Postogola would come here by boat,\" said Mokhles, who is involved with the profession for the last 50 years. Most of the part of the jheel was filled up in the 90s, where buildings and roads were constructed, said a former Wasa official. Iqbal Habib of Bapa said there used to be a jheel at Matsya Bhaban. The jheel also had a link with Ramna lake. The 2.8km Segunbagicha canal originated from there and met with the jheel behind Bangladesh Bank. Though the canals became more important after the jheels and water bodies got filled up, roads were constructed on many of them by setting up box culverts, he said. The canals were also filled up in the name of expanding Motijheel, Iqbal said. The Segunbagicha box culvert was constructed near Shilpakola Academy to Kamalapur Stadium (Bir Shreshtha Mostafa Kamal Stadium) and from there the canal remained open. Some part of the canal also mixed with Arambagh canal which was also turned to a box culvert. \"We saw boats plying before independence and the canal had links with Gopibagh and other major canals like Manda,\" said Mohammad Shahid, a resident of Fakirapool. The canal started from Dhanmondi Lake and had a link with Begunbari canal which was turned to a box culvert in the 90s. Three adjoining canals -- Razabazar, Kathalbagan and Poribagh -- met with Dhanmondi canal near Panthakunja and fell into Begunbari canal (Hatirjheel). There were paddy fields beside the canals and people used to catch fish there. The entire field would come under water during the rainy season, said Amir Hossain Mondol, a resident of Razabazar. Kathalbagan canal originated from near Panthapath crossing and used to flow into Begunbari canal near Sonargaon hotel. The canal was turned to a box culvert in the 90s. \"There was a railway bridge near Sundarban Hotel on Sonargaon Road and we used to jump from the bridge to the canal even in the 70s while taking baths,\" said Mojibor, a resident of Kathalbagan. The canal was turned to a pipe drain and a road was constructed in the 80s. \"Everyone would take baths in the canal during the rainy seasons as the canal and the adjoining paddy field would be filled with water,\" said Mohammad Babu, a resident of the area. The Paribagh canal started from behind Bangladesh National Museum and had a link with the Begunbari canal near Sonargaon hotel. The canal was turned into a box culvert in the 90s. The canal used to flow through the flood protection embankment (Beribadh) into Turag river via Jafrabad and Sultanganj. It also given way to the construction of a road in the 90s. The canal started from Mirpur-1 to Beauty Cinema Hall of Gabtoli and fell into the retention area of Wasa in Kalyanpur. It was filled up to construct plots by local influential in the 90s. The canal originated from north east corner of Tejgaon Old Airport and mixed with Bounia canal. Box culvert was constructed at different parts of the canal in the 90s. The canal originated from Nakhalpara and mixed with Hatirjheel via Mohakhali Bus Stop and Niketan. Part of the canal was turned to a box culvert in Nakhalpara in the 90s. Once 1.28km long, Shyampur-Kadamtoli canal was also filled up partially; the DCC built a road there in the 2000s. Contacted, Dhaka South City Corporation Mayor Sayeed Khokon said the box culverts have already been built and it is not possible to turn them into canals again as it will make a huge chaos in the area."

      "text": "Back in 1967 when the country attained self-sufficiency in fish production, the haors of Sunamganj produced one lakh tonnes of fish a year. Forty-eight years later, the country saw a drastic fall in the production of this natural resource, as only 22,692 tonnes of fish was collected from these haors in 2014-15 fiscal, said Chief Scientific Officer of Bangladesh Fish Research Institute Khalilur Rahman, quoting Fisheries Resource Survey System of 2016. The drop in production is mainly due to climate change and man-made hazards, he said. For the same reasons, 32 species of fish have already disappeared from the country's largest water body -- Hakaluki haor, said the chief scientific officer in his essay titled \"Impacts of Climate Change on Fish and Aquatic Resources of Bangladesh\" published in the National Fish Week 2016 Compendium. However, the good news is the government has taken various initiatives, including facilitating and promoting fish culture, to cope with the annual deficit. Bangladesh's annual demand for fish is 37.65 lakh metric tonnes and it produced 36.84 lakh metric tonnes in 2014-15, according to the Department of Fisheries (DoF). Amid this scenario, the country is observing the National Fish Week 2016 that began yesterday. \"If there was no fish culture, many of us may not get fish to eat,\" said Khalilur Rahman. A person needs 60 grammes of fish per day and the annual demand is 19.71 kg, according to the fisheries department. Addressing a press briefing at the fisheries department yesterday, Fisheries and Livestock Minister Muhammed Sayedul Hoque said, \"We hope that we'll be able to produce 38.55 lakh tonnes of fish in 2015-16.\" There are around 190 dead rivers and 99 percent of the existing rivers have lost their depth due to siltation. On top of that, the natural flow of 761 rivers has diminished to an alarming level due to excessive heat in summer. Due to a reduction in river currents, a good number of fish species in 97 percent of rivers has reduced and fish production in 88 percent rivers has been hampered, reads the essay co-authored by Jubaida Nasreen Akhter, principal officer of the BFRI. Khalilur is his essay said, \"A total of 31, 35, 29, 34, 37 and 28 species of fish have disappeared and the production of 43, 75, 59, 102, 57 and 58 species have dropped alarmingly in the rivers, haors, canals and beels of Rajshahi, Khulna, Dhaka, Barisal, Sylhet and Chittagong respectively.\" Due to deforestation in the upstream, river erosion has increased, causing massive siltation and flooding. Khalilur said local fish like Baghair and Ghoinna are disappearing from Tanguar haor while Angrot, Tilashol and Gutum fish have already disappeared from Kanglar haor. Being a fish sanctuary, the number of fish species is increasing in Moulvibazar's Hail haor, but 28 fish species are about to disappear from Kauadighi haor due to flood control dam in the area, he said, adding the production and stock of 19 fish species in the haor in Kishoreganj's Oshtogram upazila have reduced. \"Nandil, Tilashol and Angrot fish have disappeared from the haors of Netrakona. On the other hand, production of Ruhi, Katla, Mrigel, Kalbaus, Guji, Chital and Boal have dropped alarmingly,\" he said. Khalilur in his article mentioned that four major carp fishes -- Ruhi, Katla, Mrigel and Kalbaus -- used to lay eggs in the Halda, upper Meghna, Brahmaputra and Padma rivers. However, instead of upper Meghna, the Brahmaputra and Padma rivers, the fish now spawn in the Borak river in Manipur's Tipaimukh area, in the Brahmaputra river in Assam's Kamrup area and in Bodhua and Mahananda in Bihar respectively. Due to the effects of climate change, the habitats of Ghania and Ruhi in Noakhali's Kalikapur river and Bogra's Bangalee river have been destroyed completely. Hilsa could be found in about 100 rivers in different parts, including the northern region, of the country in the past. But siltation at the mouth of the Meghna now prevents the silver fish from swimming upstream, said the chief scientific officer. At yesterday's press briefing, the fisheries minister said that of the total production of fish, one-tenth comes from hilsa. He also said that 16 species of fish are being protected through artificial breeding. To prevent catching of jatka (young hilsa) and mother hilsa during the breeding period, the government distributed 37,788 tonnes of rice to 2,36,176 families of fishermen in 15 districts in 2015-16 fiscal, said the minister. A total of 1.96 lakh tonnes of rice had been distributed among fishermen in the last eight years, he added. \"As a result of these initiatives, the production of hilsa has increased to 3.87 lakh tonnes,\" he said. Sayedul said the government had already bought a survey and research ship -- RV Meen Sandhani -- to ascertain fish stocks in the 1,18,813 sq km extended maritime boundary. The government has also given licence to four organisations to collect Tuna in the Bay of Bengal."

But many are still salvageable. As the city is already plagued by waterlogging, we must preserve what remains and build new ones. Today our final report of the series testifies how steps need to be taken to protect these canals. The city dwellers hope that the authorities concerned, including Wasa, Water Development Board, Rajuk and the two city corporations, to build a better Dhaka, will recover the canals and protect those surviving. Waterlogging problem in the capital will be solved by making both the canals and drainage facilities (storm water and surface drains) functional and properly protecting the water bodies and flood flow zones, experts suggested.  They also recommended increasing canals' width and acquiring land as per practicable and protecting the downstream drainage system. \"Storm water drains are designed for capturing storm runoff from paved surfaces and conveying them to canals and rivers. But the drains are mostly occupied by domestic sewage flow, accumulated sludge and solid waste. There is little to no space for storm water to enter the system,\" said Prof Mujibur Rahman of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet) in a presentation last year. Mujibur suggested protecting downstream drainage canals and enhancing their capacity and increasing width. Widening and raising canal banks (2-3 metres), and acquiring approximately 20-30 metre area along both sides of canals immediately to construct walkways, greenbelts, tree plantation and local roads are a must, he stressed. Unless existing wetlands and water bodies are protected, the drainage system of eastern Dhaka will collapse and many of its areas will be inundated, said Mujibur. He said existing wetlands and water bodies must be delineated and protected under the purview of Wetland Conservation ACT 2000. Designated wetlands including reserved ponds must be declared as Ecologically Critical Area (ECA) through a gazette notification by the environment and forests ministry, he added. Mujibur also suggested acquiring the areas earmarked for reserved ponds, protecting from being filled up and making them available as water parks.  Architect Iqbal Habib, joint secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (Bapa), said canals are not the element of the drainage system separately, because a loop closing system was made under a plan incorporating the canals, bill, jheel and retention ponds. One of the main benefits of a canal is to contain rainwater for keeping the city dry, he said, adding, \"We also could develop waterways system under the loop network.\" Iqbal said, \"The present concept of protecting canals through slope is a wrong idea; rather two sides of the canals can be protected through a vertical micro pile, which will increase the water containing capacity as canals' width will be increased and at a time walkway will also be constructed to protect those from encroachment.\" There is a huge lacking in coordination between Wasa and the city corporations though 60 percent ownership of the drainage system belongs to Wasa and the rest 40 percent to the city corporations. \"We suggest handing over the entire drainage system to the two city corporations,\" he said. Iqbal said there is a scope to build five more projects like Hatirjheel using different water bodies and retention pond areas, which include Kalyanpur retention pond area of Wasa, an area centring Dholaikhal, an area in Rayerbazar and a water body in between Uttar and Dakkhin Khan. The government should take steps to recover the lands immediately to reduce the waterlogging problem, he said. \"We held a meeting with 26 organisations and asked the DC office to identify all the canals and ways to recover them and submit a report within 15 days,\" said DSCC Mayor Sayeed Khokon. He said they also asked Wasa to clean all the canals and drains to reduce the capital's waterlogging problem. Kathalbagan, Shantinagar and Rajarbagh are known for serious waterlogging for 10 to 12 hours after an hour of normal monsoon rain, he said. Khokon said he promised to resolve half of the problem and they have cleaned drains in Shantinagar and Razarbagh while Wasa is setting up a pump in Kamalapur, which will also help mitigate the crisis. \"Waterlogging in Kathalbagan is caused by the water flow control in Hatirjheel development project. So it is a manmade problem,\" he said. Architect Salma A Shafi, joint secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon, said all the canal banks will have to be opened, removing encroachers and keeping their natural flow intact. \"Wasa does some protection work but they do not get local councillors or community leaders involved. So the canals get encroached again,\" she said. She said the canals will have to come under excavation and setting up pillars and walkways is necessary to protect them. \"Maintenance and management is a long-time process, which remains absent in the work done in the country,\" she said. Managing Director of Wasa Taqsem A Khan said there are five organisations which are involved in maintaining the drainage system of the city -- Wasa, Dhaka South City Corporation, Dhaka North City Corporation, Water Development Board (WDB) and Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk). He said 22 percent of storm drainage in the city belonged to Wasa, and the rest of the portions are maintained by the two city corporations and WDB. Among the existing 26 canals in the city, Taqsem said 24 canals are maintained by Wasa and two by WDB. \"We have prepared a drainage master plan and handed it over to the city corporations and are implementing our portion of the plan and hope that the city corporations will implement it in the future,\" he said. \"In our drainage master plan we have suggested giving the full management to one hand, so it is necessary to bring the entire management under the two city corporations. We hope to gradually hand over our portions to the city corporations also,\" Taqsem added. Waterlogging is being created for lack of water body, said Taqsem, suggesting the necessity of cleaning storm water drains, surface drains and canals. The number of ponds in the city is very few and if ponds would be available then it would preserve rain water as a pond is also a retention area, he said. \"We have to create more water retention areas,\" he suggested. Taqsem said, \"We have already started cleaning the canals to increase its navigability and also trying to clean the box culverts properly by using advanced cleaning equipment.\" Taqsem said Wasa and city corporations clean their own drains though it is a huge challenge as many people dump solid waste into the water bodies, storm water drains and canals due to a lack of proper solid waste management system. People also consider the places as their dumping areas, he said, adding, those who do construction work also dump their construction waste blocking the drainage channel. He said they are trying to keep the canals as navigable as possible. Contacted, DNCC Mayor Annisul Huq said, \"We will maintain the canals and drainage channels and are ready to take the responsibility once we have complete authority over Wasa's drainage department.\" This year the waterlogging problem of the city was comparatively less as some work regarding the waterlogging issues was done by the authority concerned due to their pressure, he said. Responding about recovering the canals properly, Annis said they do not have any power in this regard; only they can put pressure on the authority concerned to recover the canals. He said, \"We will again start pressuring Wasa and the DC office to start working to reduce waterlogging from October and will start monitoring from November so that they can finish it by January.\" \"For proper drainage of the city, there is no alternative to restoration of the canals, which unfortunately mostly exist in records. If there is a commitment, restoration is possible. Hatirjheel is a glaring example of the value of restoration,\" said Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela). She said the government should follow the CS maps and bring back the water lines on a priority basis. \"With strong political commitments, at least half of the canals can be freed from encroachments and thoughtless development work.\" \"The land grabbers cannot be more powerful than the government. It is not only restoration, but also for the sake of a permanent protection, the encroachers should be sternly dealt with so that common people regain faith in the effectiveness of wetland related laws,\" she stressed."

      "text": "Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with a population of around 160 million. The economy is rapidly transforming from agriculture-based to industry- and service-based. Despite achieving significant landmarks in the fight against poverty, especially through the transformation of agriculture (increased yield), micro-credit expansion and RMG export, poverty still remains a daunting problem for a vast majority of the population. This article deals with trends in the major fields of economic development and the challenges of faster growth and equitable development of the common people. The article does not include the most recent data and issues because it provides a historical perspective. POVERTY: GROWTH NEXUS During the decades since the 1990s, faster growth rate has been identified as one of the causes in reducing poverty. Graph 1 shows that the real GDP growth rate in 1990 was 5.94% and gradually increased to 6.12% in 2014. During the past two decades, the growth rate in some years was around 4%, but the overall trend was above 5% on the average. Bangladesh experienced two devastating natural disasters (flood and cyclone) in 2007 and a subsequent food price shock in 2008. However, the country's real GDP growth was greater in the 2005-2010 period relative to previous periods. Poverty estimates based on the 2010 HIES show that the proportion of poor people declined from 48.9% in 2000 to 40% in 2005 and then to 31.5% in 2010. The decline in extremely poor people was from 34.3% in 2000, to 25.1% in 2005 and then to 17.6% in 2010 (World Bank, 2013). Around 12.4 million non-poor also remained highly vulnerable to poverty in 2010, so it is not just the poor but also those on the margins who are susceptible (World Bank, 2012). During this period, growths in income and consumption expenditure were the main drivers of poverty reduction. In fact, growth during the first part of the decade (2000-2010) was more significant than redistribution in reducing poverty. In the first half of the decade, the faster reduction of poverty due to growth only has been accompanied by a worsening of income distribution. Graph 1 also shows the condition of inflation and unemployment rates as well. With the shift of rural labour force from farming to non-farming activities, the predominance of non-tradable activities, especially outside agriculture, and the increasing rate of informal sector employment, the full benefits of faster growth and economic transformation did not benefit a vast section of the poor. The official figures for the unemployment rate show an increasing trend, but the labour force survey (LFS) data does not include the under-employed, self-employed, and unpaid family helpers in calculating the value. In reality, the unemployment rate is higher than what is depicted in Graph 1. INFLATION\n Estimation of historical changes in monetary policy (MP) and their subsequent impact on the economy, raise the difficult question of how changes in MP affect inflation, output, exchange and interest rates (Sargent and Sims, 2011). Commitment to a nominal anchor like inflation rate itself says nothing about what economic variables are best suited to play that role. Should it be money supply, exchange rate, CPI or a combination of all? With the emergence of floating exchange rate, many emerging economies, including Bangladesh, have chosen the inflation rate as a nominal anchor for MP. In Bangladesh, the major issues are: - Inflation acceleration in 2011-2012 led by food prices; - Inflation affected by global prices of food commodities and prices of fuel, raw materials and intermediate goods (used in manufacturing industries); - Growth of reserve money, broad money, credit to the private sector and to the government being more on the high side vis-a-vis growth and inflation rates. Government borrowing from the banking sector and Bangladesh Bank (which is alarmingly high) has not only created a \"crowding out effect\" in private sector investment, but has also created inflationary pressure because government expenditure is not always used for \"real sectors\". - Over the last two decades, inflation has been somewhat contained. Recently, global prices of fuel and commodities have fallen, which may attribute to containing inflation. PRIVATE SECTOR CREDIT GROWTH Conventional wisdom says that there is a negative correlation between the real rate of interest and credit growth. Graph 2 shows the relationship between the real growth of interest and private sector credit growth. The low interest rate does not automatically result in credit growth. There are periods when relatively low interest has not lead to high credit growth and vice versa. In effect, the current monetary policy framework should go beyond the conventional wisdom-based approach by broadening its scope to take into account aspects such as the concentration of employment in agriculture and informal sectors; asymmetric information flows; significant transaction costs; high risk premiums; and general lack of incentives on the part of the banks that limit availability of credit in employment-intensive sectors and activities. This will require the monetary policy to be broadened beyond monetary aggregates covering low inflation and stabilisation. If we look at Graph 3, the share of agriculture declined from 30% in 1990 to 19% in 2013. The share of industry and service sector steadily increased. As mentioned earlier, an increasing amount of people are now employed in industry and other sectors, especially the non-farming sector. If the macroeconomic policy is to accelerate the pace of poverty reduction in Bangladesh, the development of non-farming enterprises (large, medium, small) should be accelerated so that a large portion of poor people can benefit. For these processes to be effective, the macroeconomic policy has to focus on both the demand and supply sides. For example, the monetary policy should create a favourable condition for investment and consumption demand in order to boost the production. This in turn will result in increased employment and purchasing power of the poor. On the supply side, the monetary policy can remove the impediments of the access to finance faced by the poor. So the role of SME enterprises, expansion of agriculture credit and financial inclusion must be duly emphasised. EXTERNAL SECTOR\n The effect of the global financial crisis of 2007 on Bangladesh has been insignificant due to the prudent policies of Bangladesh Bank and the steady performance of the external sector. Graph 4 shows the growth of imports and exports. The negative balance of trade is offset by steady inflow of foreign remittances from migrant workers. Remittance steadily grew from USD 10.9 billion in November 2009 to USD 14 billion in FY 2014. Foreign exchange reserves also grew steadily from USD 10.7 billion in November 2009 to around USD 22 billion in March 2015. The external balances remain comfortable even with weak export growth and strong imports. Deficit in the current account emerged at USD 1.3 billion in July-January of FY 2015 compared to a USD 2.5 billion surplus during the same period in FY 2014. The deficit resulted from a weak export growth of 2.1% and a strong import growth of 16.4%. Slow export growth reflected the adjustment of the garment industry to stricter labour and safety standards (especially after the GSP suspension by USA and the Rana Plaza Tragedy) and slowed down demand from importing countries. The nominal taka-dollar exchange rate has been relatively stable, mainly due to interventions by Bangladesh Bank, although the real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated by about 33% since its trough in 2011. CHALLENGES IN FISCAL MANAGEMENT Fiscal performance and expenditure management has been weak in Bangladesh in recent times. Despite increasing budgets from one year to the next, very little has been done regarding the control of unsustainable government spending and borrowing and the need to increase revenue sources. The government is facing budgetary constraints and is running up the deficit. Total borrowing from the financial system as of FY 2011 was USD billion, of which USD 2.2 billion was from the domestic banking system. This amount represents a 40% increase over 2010. A significant portion of the government budget has been allocated to subsidies, which could put a dent in fiscal sustainability efforts if there are no price adjustments. Revenue mobilisation has also been inadequate. Tax revenue mobilisation in this case is very low. The tax system, despite recent reforms, is still poor. Mobilisation of revenue is one of the lowest in the world, while old policies and rigid administrative practices mean that the system has been very slow in bringing in new income-generating activities within the tax net. Such weaknesses mean that a significant portion of activities remain untaxed in addition to rampant tax evasion. Bangladesh has the lowest tax revenues to GDP ratio in South Asia. Tax revenues have exhibited a very slow upward trend over 2004-2009. Compared to the world average of 13.5%, Bangladesh can collect revenues amounting to only 8.6% of GDP. Massive leakage in the form of wasteful public expenditure and corruption also pose significant challenges for fiscal sustainability in Bangladesh. The Hall Mark incident of Sonali Bank and massive irregularities in Basic Bank, both state-owned banks, deserve special attention with respect to fiscal mismanagement. In the medium term at least, the government needs to commit to a budget that excludes certain forms of unnecessary spending and transfers. Revenue mobilisation has to take greater precedence, both from tax and non-tax sources. Total domestic savings as a percentage of GDP have remained stagnant, which means that not enough savings are being generated for investment, one of the few alternatives against which is to resort to public financing through borrowing. More effective financial regulation has to be put in place to ensure that credit/funds are being channelled into the productive sectors of the economy and are not concentrated in the hands of the select few. MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS (MDGS)\n The global poverty reduction efforts now rest on interrelated aspects:Achieving MDGs by 2015;Moving forward with social protection and safety nets for the poor. Bangladesh has attained satisfactory progress in achieving the MDGs. The areas where Bangladesh achieved the targets include Goal 1: Eradicating extreme poverty and hunger; Goal 2: Achieving universal primary education;Goal 3: Promoting gender equality and empowering women; Goal 4: Reducing child mortality rate; and Goal 6: Combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. Experts found that Bangladesh has some weaknesses in Goal 5: Improving maternal health, specifically maternal mortality rate, and does not have any control over Goal Ensuring environmental sustainability and Goal 8: Developing a global partnership for development. Besides these, Bangladesh has some weaknesses in employment generation (Goal 1, Target 1.B) and malnutrition (Goal 1, Target 1.C). These observations were brought up at a press briefing on 'Southern Voice on Post-MDG-Dhaka Expert Group Meeting' organised at the CPD auditorium in Dhaka in January 2013 (The Financial Express, 2013) I would like to mention that we have challenges before us. We have to reduce the percentage of poor to 29% by 2015; we have to reduce maternal mortality rate to 139, child mortality to 31 and enrolment to primary school to 100% by 2015. The gap is more evident in the nutritional outcome of the MDGs. The poor in Bangladesh still suffer from nutritional deficiency, which can be improved by increasing the entitlement capacity of the poor to have a balanced diet. I shall not go into the various challenges and caveats we face, but I will single out one of the most important challenges, which is \"institutional challenges\". Impact of various efforts for improving the socio-economic conditions of the poor in the developing countries can be maximised through proper management and implementation of development projects. Effective project management and implementation are also crucial for sustainable development. Institutions, which encompass entities at the local level, community level, national level, and project management units, are integral parts of project management and implementation. However, despite strong statements and rhetoric about the essential role of institutions, and the realisation of its potential contribution in development efforts, the issues of institutions have received relatively little attention by policy makers, planners and implementers of development projects. CHALLENGES Political instability The main challenge is the prolongation and intensification of political turmoil. This affects the economy in both the short and medium terms. The lack of political stability results in a lack of good governance, transparency and accountability in the public and private sectors. The political turmoil of late 2013 and early 2015 has resulted in economic losses. Different estimates of GDP foregone range from 0.55% to 1.1% of GDP. Lack of good governance Corruption, nepotism, and political interference in economic activities result in inefficiencies, wastage of public fund and lower rate of growth, employment and poverty reduction. Reform measures Reforms in the financial sector, public enterprise and regulatory bodies should be carried out. Growth rates Average annual GDP growth rate needs to be increased to 7.5% to 8% in order for Bangladesh to reach middle-income status by 2021. For this, we require: (a) Investment to be increased to 32% from the current 26-27% of GDP; (b) Increased employment; (c) Increased quality of education and training; (d) Increased total factor productivity (TFP); (e) Increased export diversification; and (f) Introduction of improved technologies in all sectors. Mitigating adverse impact of climate changeBangladesh is vulnerable to environmental risks and climate change, which must be addressed properly.Improved human welfare While growth is necessary, attention to distributional aspects of income and assets among the people has to be addressed as well. This aspect coupled with higher allocation of resources to education, health, and social welfare will result in increased human welfare. RISK FACTORS In the backdrop of gradual international integration, it will be important for policy makers to monitor external factors since any external instability can easily be transmitted into the internal economy. The risk factors for the Bangladeshi economy include the following.  Insufficient infrastructure, i.e., insufficient public capital, mainly insufficient investment, in power generation could be a major threat for growth;  Constraints in domestic revenue mobilisation with continuing dependence on international trade tax, with direct tax collection increasing at a pace that is slower than the domestic Value Added Tax (VAT);  Low degree of monetisation hinders normal flourishing of the equity market. A shallow equity market is subject to easy manipulation. Low level of financial development is also characterised by the absence of effective bond and insurance markets;  Slow pace of complementary reforms to ensure improvement of environment for private investment including FDI; improvement of governance in public infrastructural facilities and utilities; regulatory framework for capital and debt market; contract enforcement through judicial process; and transparency in public expenditure;  Lack of human capital with adequate technical or vocational education;  Constraints in the opportunities of investment by non-resident Bangladeshis in productive sectors. Within this context, faster GDP growth consistent with poverty reduction goals can be met if first, the efficacy and quality of regulatory bodies like Bangladesh Bank, Bangladesh Securities Exchange Commission, Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, and Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission advance significantly. Second, if the efficiency of government bodies like Planning Commission, Tariff Commission, and Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division of the Planning Ministry enhances considerably. Third, if the agencies responsible for promotion of business like the Board of Investment (BOI) and Export Promotion Bureau become more dynamic and pro-business. Fourth, if the bodies representing business interests like the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce & Industry, and Bangladesh Garments Manufactures and Exporters' Association work in tandem with the government for sustainable and equitable development to ensure benefits of development to the poor and disadvantaged. Last but not the least, if and only if good governance with adequate transparency and accountability in both the public and private sectors is ensured. To address these issues appropriate macro-policies, especially fiscal, monetary and trade policies combined with a set of heterodox policies, backed by political will and political stability (with democratic norms, rule of law and good governance), are necessary to enable the Bangladeshi economy to grow at an accelerated rate in the medium term and pave the way for Bangladesh to become a \"success story\" of overall development.

      "text": "Terming the sea as a huge source of resources, including fisheries, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today said the government is taking initiatives to start the extraction of these resources within the next five years. \"Or else, there's a fear of losing this opportunities. So, we're trying to take steps fast,\" she said while addressing the inaugural session of the National Fisheries Week 2016 held at the Krishibid Institution Auditorium in the city. Citing the winning of maritime boundary cases against India and Myanmar, Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh has potential of fisheries resources in the sea which needs to be extracted. \"So, the government has put emphasis on 'Blue Economy'. As Bangladesh has no experience of extracting resources from the deep sea, an international tender has been floated in this regard and four companies participated in the bid, she mentioned. The prime minister also called upon the country's businesspeople and exporters to maintain the high quality and standards of their products and exportable items and thus uphold the country's image and maintain their own reputation. \"I call upon all concerned to remain alert so that the image of the country is not tarnished alongside bringing personal disaster while making a bit more profit,\" she said adding that this should be followed in all exportable products, including fisheries, alongside marketing of local products. Laboratories have already been set up in Dhaka, Chittagong and Khulna to maintain the quality and standards of the exportable items while steps have been taken to examine the exportable fisheries items to maintain their hygiene, she said. Earlier, the prime minister distributed five gold medals and 15 silver medals to 20 individuals and institutions for their outstanding contribution to fish production in the country. Each of the gold medal recipient also received a Tk 50,000 cheque while the silver medal recipient Tk 30,000. She also underscored the need for maintaining capital dredging and maintenance dredging of the rivers concerned to maintain the biodiversity as well as help boosting fisheries production, reducing losses from flood and also to save the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest. Noting that fishery is a very important local and foreign currency-earning item for the country, she said hat fishes could give people safer nutrition than meat. Hasina noted that Bangladesh currently ranked 4th in the world in terms of fisheries production from the sweet water sources and there is a very good chance to grab the first place if all concerned take more care considering the level of rivers, canals, beels, haors and water bodies that the country have. Hasina said her government coming to power in 1996 allocated Tk 40 crore to ensure quality and standards of Shrimp Processing. \"Such efforts made it possible to restore Bangladesh's Shrimp market in different countries, including European Union,\" she said. Hasina said livelihood of about one 1.82 crore people are now directly related to fisheries sector while contribution of the sector to the country's GDP is four percent and 60 percent of the animal protein comes from fish. Under the National Fisheries Policy, she said, steps have been taken to maintain environmental balance, protect bio-diversity, management of society- based fisheries at Jalmohals and development of breeding places for fishes. Besides, 26 projects have been implemented at a cost of Tk 107 crore for the development of the infrastructure of Fisheries sector, she said adding that 799 Jalmohals have been handed over to the Fisheries Department to expand fish cultivation. As a result, FAO of the United Nations rewarded Fisheries Department with prestigious 'Edward Souma' in recognition of its successful contribution to implementation of the Fish Production and Fish Cultivation Expansion programmes, she said. The prime minister said her government took effective measures to protect mother 'Hilsa' and resist 'Jatka' catching by providing fishermen with food assistance. \"The move has helped boost Hilsa output,\" she said. Later, the prime minister released fish fry at Gano Bhaban Lake marking the National Fisheries Week 2016. Fisheries and Livestock Minister Muhammad Sayedul Hoque spoke on the occasion while Ministry Secretary Mohammad Maksudul Hasan Khan delivered the address of welcome."

      "text": "These are the designers, engineers and CEO's that saw a vision of the future when others were blind, and in the pursuit of their dreams of the future, left a lasting impact on the world of transportation and mass mobility. There will always be mention of the Henry Fords and the Enzo Ferraris and the Horacio Paganis, but these men are the unsung heroes and deserve their share of the limelight.                                                               SOICHIRO HONDA Famous word: \"The value of life can be measured by how many times the soul has been deeply stirred\" Founder, Honda Motor Corp. Soichiro Honda started his stellar career as one of the best minds in the automotive world as a bike mechanic, fitting electric motors to bicycles to make rudimentary motorbikes. He would go on to design the Honda Super Cub, the highest selling motorised vehicle on the planet. Honda's vision of a globalised world led to him taking the decision of exporting his cars to North America and setting up dealerships abroad, starting with what is still one of the best selling cars on the planet - the Honda Civic. He also got his company involved in motorsport like Formula 1 in order to drive R&D - decades before other mainstream manufacturers followed suit.    SIR ALEC ISSIGONIS Famous word: \"An expert is someone who tells you why you can't do something.\" Designer & technical director, British Motor Corporation.    Referred to as the \"Greek God\" by his colleagues at the now defunct British Motor Corporation, genius designer and engineer Sir Alec Issigonis was responsible for two of Britain's greatest hits - the John Lennon that is the original Austin Mini and the Paul Mcartney that is the Morris Minor. The Mini is the best selling British car in history with a production run of 5.3 million cars, featuring ingenous packaging that left engineers scratching their heads trying to come up with city cars that coul beat it in practicality. It would become a global icon, along with the man who designed it. The Minor and the Mini were early heroes of the race to build cheap, eco city runabout car - combining chic style with endless praticality before it became cool. It's funny how oil crises' gifted us some of the coolest cars.   COLIN CHAPMAN Famous word: \"Simplify, the add lightness\" Engineer and founder, Lotus Cars. Colin Chapman, chap amongst men, studied structural engineering at UCL before training to be a pilot and almost joining the RAF. We're glad he didn't, because without him and his knowledge of lightweight materials and construction techniques, the world of supercars and lightweight sports-cars would be very different. Chapman's ideas about monocoque construction and chassis design helped his company Lotus win at Formula 1, paving the way for modern safety standards and body rigidity. Under his direction, Team Lotus won 7 Formula 1 Constructors' titles, 6 Drivers' Championships, and the Indy 500, between 1962 and 1978. While Lotus has been a dominant force on the track, its road cars proved that you didn't need 8 cylinders to make a good sports car - the Elan, Elise and Espirit are all by-products of that ethos of going light. It inspired a whole class of cars - the British lightweights - as well as track cars like the modern day Ariel Atom, BAC Mono and more.   BMW and Tesla on the next page\n"

      "text": "Though it is essential to recover the city canals from encroachers and increase its width to save Dhaka from flood and waterlogging, Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Wasa) has turned around13 canals to concrete drains which significantly reduced the canals' water carrying capacity. Experts said Wasa in the name of protecting and demarcating those canals through U-channels and trapezoidal CC block lining (an impermeable layer provided at the sides of canal to improve its life and discharge capacity) virtually reduced their widths. During construction of those U-channels and lining work, in most of the cases, Wasa did not follow the CS maps to protect the canals properly, and the work also created scopes for grabbers to encroach the canals. Though the lining and U-channels protected the canals from encroachers but it reduced the canals' width in many cases; the work should have been done keeping it wider, said experts. Wasa took the initiative of constructing RCC U-channel and trapezoidal CC block lining on 13 canals under \"Dhaka Water Supply and Sanitation Project\", funded by World Bank, which started in 2009 and continued till 2016. The canals where RCC U-channels were constructed are Khilgaon-Basabo khal (canal), Khilgaon-Basabo up stream, and Gerani, Sahjadpur, Mohakhali and Segunbagicha khals. Block lining work was done in Sahjahanpur, Kalynapur main khal, Abdullahpur branch khal, Abdullahpur and Segunbagicha khals. Apart from those, earth cutting and demarcation work were done in Digun and Sutivola khals under the project. More canals also partially came under Wasa's CC-block lining work, including Katasur, Ramchandrapur, Kalyanpur Ga, and Ka and Ibrahimpur khals out of the project. During a recent visit it was found that most of these canals were not demarcated following the actual width of the canals which were much wider even in the 70s or 80s. \"The Gerani canal was huge even in the 90s as big size boats used to run through it. The canal had a link with Trimohini,\" said Md Jobbar, a Manda resident. \"I went to Trimohini through Gerani in the 90s on a launch during the rainy season,\" he said. Even in the dry season its width was around 40 feet and rest of the land would dry up and turn to a paddy field, he said. Segunbagicha and Khilgaon-Basabo canals were also huge and had a link with the Gerani canal, he said. But Gerani was turned to an 8.2 metre U-channel, Khilgaon-Basabo to a 9.5 metre U-channel and Segunbagicha canal was turned to a 19 metre U-channel with CC block lining. All the three canals now confluence at Manda and fall into the Balu river through Manda khal which also became very narrow, said locals. But according to a CS map record, width of the Gerani canal, which was under Dakkhingaon Mouja, was 25 to 120 feet, which started from Trimohoni and ended at Manda, where its width was 40 to 45 feet. But it was seen that Wasa has constructed U-channels keeping around 25 feet (8.2 metre) width. Even according to the list of canals at the Deputy Commissioner's (DC) office in Dhaka, the Gerani canal is mentioned as Dakkhingaon-Nandipara canal and its width is 60 to 130 feet. The other canals will be more or less the same since Wasa did not try to maintain their actual widths as per the CS map during the construction of the U-channels. Managing Director of Wasa Taqsem A Khan, however, said Wasa followed the CS map during construction of the U-channels and lining work. \"If a canal comes under the lining work it remains protected from encroachment most of the cases,\" he said, adding that after the work encroachment becomes easily visible. \"Without the lining work, it is easier for encroachers to fill one or two feet of a canal and afterwards confusion arises as to whom the land actually belongs.\" So the decision taken at that time was a right one, he said. Taqsem said lining and setting up walkway is very necessary after the bank protection work since a walkway also does the work of demarcation. Prof Mujibur Rahman of Bangladesh University and Engineering Technology (Buet) said the capacities of the canals are seriously reduced due to the U-channels. \"When it is imperative to increase the canals' capacity to manage storm water, Wasa reduced the capacity of the canals. Through the work they have turned the canals into drains,\" he  said. Wasa through the U-channels has reduced the storm water carrying capacity of the canals drastically, he said. \"When experts are criticising the concept of box culvert, how could Wasa go for this kind of concrete drain again?\" Regarding Wasa's claim of doing the work for the canals' demarcation, Prof Mujibur said it is wrong to assume that encroachment will not be done this way. \"We suggest increasing a canal's width to 100 feet when it remains 60 feet; 70 feet if it is 40, but during the U-channel work they turned around 80 feet wide canal to 20 feet.\" Prof Mujibur suggested stopping construction of U-channels replacing canals and reassessing its conveyance capacity considering present and future runoff. Architect Salma A Shafi, joint secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (Bapa), said a canal should be kept natural. Salma, who carried out a survey on the city canals around five years back, said revival and proper management of a canal has to be planned. \"A canal is a natural entity and it is a tributary of river. But Wasa has turned them to drains.\" \"When a canal turns to drain, people will dump waste; they will connect sewerage line and it will remain no longer a canal,\" she said. To protect the canals, walkways or footpaths will have to be constructed beside the banks. \"Not only are we wasting money by constructing concrete drains but also damaging the canals,\" she added. Iqbal Habib, another joint secretary of Bapa, said total area of a canal should be determined calculating the entire runoff of a region. \"Now Wasa is trying to restore the canals according to its current state,\" he said, adding that the actual area (paridhi) and canal space are being squeezed for that. The canals are being narrowed down more in the name of constructing channel and lining work, and eventually it becomes a garbage drain as it turns to a dead canal. \"It is a wrong process,\" he said. Iqbal suggested protecting the canals by restoring it and its banks using different methods calculating the region-based runoff water. He also suggested creating a connectivity between the canals, bills (water bodies), and jheels since all of those complement each other. If it is possible to restoring the canals properly and ensuring its connectivity, only then the canals' effectiveness will remain active, otherwise the canals turn to a dumping zone, he stressed. He suggested constructing walkways recovering the canals properly and stopping dumping of garbage into the canals. \"If necessary the government should forcibly recover the canals based on the original map (CS map),\" he said. Though many claimed that the canal lands belonged to them and showed papers as proof but those were forged. If needed, the government should offer compensation to recover the canals, he suggested. To save the capital from waterlogging, the government will have to bring back the natural drainage system. \"We are observing that the intensity of rain is increasing due to climate change. It will be a normal phenomenon in the near future when 300 to 400 millimetres of rain will fall within a day,\" he said.  \"The capital will face a huge waterlogging crisis at that time  if we  do  not  act  now  and  protect  the  canals,\" Iqbal  added."

They were provided food and lodging by Bangladeshis from Sunday night till yesterday morning. The Indians expressed their satisfaction and gratitude to the Bangladesh people for the cordial support, locals said. Abu Sufian, 48, of Chawratari village in Mogholhat union, said, \"They didn't go to their houses as those were inundated by flood water. They told me that they would be given government relief materials so they went to the mainland.\" Suzal Haque, 46, of the village said, \"We helped them on humanitarian grounds,\" he said, adding that the Indians were happy with the behavior of the Bangladeshis. Ayesha Begum, 35, wife of Alamgir Hossain of India's Daribas village said, \"We were happy and satisfied getting shelter and food from Bangladesh nationals. We got cordial behaviour from Bangladesh nationals.\" \"We will never forget Bangladesh people's love. If Bangladeshis had not helped us, we would not be able to save ourselves,\" said Ayesha's husband. Residents of Chawratari and Karnapur villages of Mogholhat union said four villages -- Jari Dharla, Badarkuti, Nagortari and Daribas -- of Dinhata Police Station under Cooch Behar in West Bengal, India, stood like islands in the rivers Dharla, Singimari and Giridhari as water level of the rivers increased sharply. Marooned by flood water, many took refuge in the houses of villagers of neighbouring Bangladesh, which prompted the West Bengal government to express their gratitude to the Bangladesh government. Rabindra Nath Ghosh, a minister in the government of West Bengal, told newsmen that if these 4,000 people did not take shelter in Bangladesh, they would have been washed away by flood water. Habibur Rahman Habib, chairman of Mogholhat Union Parishad, said he visited the border villages where Indian flood affected people took shelter. \"I told our people to take care of the Indian flood affected people, and they did it very well,\" he said. Nayek Subedar Badsha Miah, camp commander of Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB)15-Battalion, said the flood affected Indian people who took shelter in  the border villages went back home yesterday. Bangladesh nationals gave them shelter on humanitarian grounds, he said, adding that BGB men monitored them while they were in Bangladesh."

      "text": "A good number of people at Barotopa village in Sreepur of Gazipur are now passing busy time producing muri (puffed rice) in a conventional way to meet the increasing demand during the Ramadan. There are at least 250 people involved in the manual production of puffed rice in the area. \"The handmade muri has a high demand in market despite its relatively higher price. I have been marketing the homemade muri for nine years for those customers seeking to buy chemical free and unadulterated muri,\" said Mohammad Salim, a puffed rice trader in the capital's Gopibagh area. He told these to journalists while describing quality and features of such muri produced at the village. Salim said he supplied the muri to the market after collecting it from the producers at the village, adding, \"The muri is sold in some specified stores only and customers buy from there.\" The handmade muri is in high demand, particularly in Cantonment area and Rajarbagh Police Lines where 1Kg of muri is sold at Tk 90. Somej Uddin of Barotopa village, who has been producing muri for some 20 years, said they collected paddy from a local trader for producing the muri to which no chemicals were added except for salt. \"My wife, Parul Akter, is a muri maker too. Paddy trader, Mohor Ali of Barotopa Bazar, gives us 11 maunds of paddy a week, from which we can produce seven maunds of muri.  For this we are paid only Tk 4,000. On top of that we are often given Tk 3,000 for the same amount of production if the quality gets low,\" added Somej, who supports a family of five by producing muri. Gias Uddin, who too is engaged in the job, said they picked dry leaves up twice during the dry season and then used them as kitchen fuel while producing the muri. \"The wage is too low,\" he added. Abdus Sahid, another muri maker, said it took eight days from threshing and husking paddy to producing muri. \"Typically we get 11 maunds of paddy a week from the trader. We are given 22 more maunds during Ramadan, as there is a high demand at the time,\" Sahid added. The producers, however, said instead of taking the paddy from traders, they could produce muri on their own if they could directly get the paddy from the government or a financial assistance to run the business. Kamruzzaman, a customer in the market, said the price of the handmade muri is higher than that of the machine-made ones by at least Tk 40. Crispy and tasty, the muri does not get spongy even when mixed with other food items, mentioned the customer. Another buyer, Tajul Islam, said, \"The rice of the machine-made muri is stored in the warehouse, but the paddy from which handmade muri is made is directly collected and husked. We witness the process every day,\" adding, \"One can easily distinguish between qualities of the two types.\" However, paddy trader Mohor said he collected \"Mota paddy\" (a particular variety of paddy known as Mota in Gazipur) from Patuakhali as it is highly expedient for producing muri. In addition, IRRI-28 rice is also suitable, but it is not in abundance, mentioned Mohor. \"It costs a lot to bring the Mota paddy from Patuakhali because the traditional varieties of rice sold in the market cannot yield quality muri,\" said the trader, adding that each month he marketed 1,200 to 1,400 maunds of muri out of 2,100 maunds of paddy brought from Patuakhali. The production cost for 1,200 maunds of muri stands at around Tk 84,000, while it brings him a profit of Tk 24,000 to Tk 30,000, he mentioned. \"Six years back, I used to export the handmade muri to Dubai, Malaysia and Singapore. But it is quite difficult for us now to export the muri despite a high demand, as the items made with machines can easily flood the market,\" said Mohor."

However, flood situation in Kushtia slightly improved yesterday as water of the river was flowing around 4cm below than that on Saturday.  \"Some bricks of right part of the T-groyen were washed away around 8:00am after the steel net over the dam got loose due to strong current,\" reports our Rajshahi correspondent, quoting Mahabub Rasel, an on-duty section officer of the dam. Later, staffers of Water Development Board (WDB) in Rajshahi repaired the damaged part by dumping around 150 sandbags there, said Rasel, adding that about 500 sandbags were kept ready near the dam to deal with any bad situation. \"The dam is now safe,\" he claimed. The WDB sealed the T-groyen area and prohibited public gathering in and around it. Police were deployed near the dam gate to check people's entrance.      The river water was flowing around 4cm below the danger level yesterday noon, said WDB officials. On August 22, the Padma water began to rise after India started releasing water through the Farakka Barrage to tackle their flood situation in Bihar, according to the WDB. The swelling Padma water entered the city's Fudkipara through a drain connected with the river yesterday, flooding Martyr Suresh Pandey Road. The river water also inundated some of the city's recreation centers like Simante Obokash, Simante Nongor, Padma Garden, Shimla Park and Lalon Shah Mancha.  The flood situation in Bagha upazila is the worst. Some 10,000 people of Chalkrajapur union of the upazila were affected by flood. Mokhlesur Rahman, executive engineer of Rajshahi WDB, said the water level increased by 6 centimetres in the last 24 hours and it remained static at 18.46 metres since the morning. \"When the rise of water stops, it will recede quickly within days as the Jamuna is flowing much below the danger level,\" he said. Our Kushtia correspondent adds, according to WDB sources, water flowing in the Padma was recorded at 14.03cm at Hardinge Bridge point in Bheramara around 3:30pm yesterday. It was 14.07cm around 2:00pm Saturday.   WDB sources added that sudden rise of water level in the river left around 60,000 people in 30 villages of Daulatpur upazila marooned on Friday. It has been primarily estimated that crops of around 1,800 hectares of land went under water.  Toufiqur Rahman, Daulatpur upazila nirbahi officer, said the local administration allocated 20 metric tonnes of rice to Ramkrishnapur union, whose 20,000 people were hit by the sudden flood."

Bangladesh has repeatedly contended that India has carried out 'unilateral diversion' of the waters, thereby adversely affecting the water flow in Bangladesh. The dispute over the sharing of river waters between India and Bangladesh originated in 1951 when Bangladesh was the part of Pakistan, because India decided to construct a barrage at Farakka. However, Pakistan opposed the construction of the Farakka Barrage in 1951 and series of correspondences they were subsequently exchanged. Between 1960 and 1970, several meetings were held where two countries shared substantial amount of data. In 1970 India for the first time acknowledged Ganges as an International river. Following the independence Bangladesh signed the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Peace with Indian in 1772 for the promotion of goodwill between the countries. Article VI of the treaty provides, \"both the nations agree to take joint action in the field of flood control, river basin development and development of hydroelectric power and irrigation\". Pursuant to this treaty an Indo bangle Joint River Commission was established in 1972 for carrying out a comprehensive study of the river system. Farakka Barrage was completed in 1971 and became operational in 1975. In 1975 India and Bangladesh signed a temporary allocation agreement which was valid only for a period of 41 days; as a result Bangladesh raised the Farakka issue at the 31st session of the UN General Assembly in 1976. Afterward a bilateral discussion between India and Bangladesh resulted in the formation of water sharing agreement in 1977 but the agreement entered into only for the duration of five years. A significant feature of the treaty was Article 2 it provided a 'guarantee clause' for Bangladesh by assuring it a minimum of 80 percent of its shares during the lean period and further reinforces in Article 12 Bangladesh's share of water cannot be reduced under any circumstances till the duration of the treaty.  When the 1977 agreement lapsed in 1982, they signed two memorandum of understanding (MOU) in 1982 and 1985 but it did not include a minimum of 80 percent 'guarantee clause'. After the expiry of this MOU, a vacuum remained till the water sharing treaty in 1996 was concluded. The Ganges water treaty does not provide a minimum 'guarantee clause', which was in 1977 agreement. In present Article II of treaty simply mentioned that \"In the event flow at Farakka falls below 50,000 cusecs in any 10-day period, the two Governments will enter into immediate consultations to make adjustments on an emergency basis, in accordance with the principles of equity, fair play and no harm to either party\". The dispute resolution mechanism mentioned in Article VII \"The Joint Committee shall be responsible for implementing the arrangements contained in this Treaty. Any difference or dispute arising in this regard, if not resolved by the Joint Committee, shall be referred to the Indo-Bangladesh Joint Rivers Commission. If the difference or dispute still remains unresolved, it shall be referred to the two Governments which shall meet urgently at the appropriate level to resolve it by mutual discussion\".\n The dispute resolution mechanism has been extensively criticized because it does not provide an arbitration mechanism for settlement of the dispute, while two water sharing treaty of India with Nepal \"The Mahakali Treaty 1996\" and Pakistan \"The Indus Waters Treaty 1960\" embraced the arbitration mechanism. In fact, Article IX of the treaty stipulates that the \"principle of equality, fairness and no harm to either party\" shall guide the future action of both nations. The equitable utilisation theory is based on the Roman maxim \"sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas\" which means \"you use your own so as not to injure another\". The reflection of this theory is visible in Article 9 and 10 of the treaty between India and Bangladesh. This is evident in Articles 5-7 of UN Watercourses Convention 1997, as well as Articles IV-VIII of Helsinki Rules, 1966. This indicates the application of internationally recognised principle to the dispute, but the problem is that both the country is not a party of the UN Watercourse Convention 1997 which has entered into force17 August 2014. There is growing concern that water flow in the region will be insufficient to meet future demands and there also proposals from upper riparian countries such as China to divert water for its own use which can further worsen the existing dispute. This highlights the need to hold multilateral negotiations or discussion on water sharing. Therefore, Bangladesh should focus on plugging the loopholes of the 1996 Treaty and ensure her demand like 'Minimum guarantee clause' and 'Arbitration mechanism' by invoking Article X 'review procedure' in consonance with international legal principles to meet its future demands.

      "text": "Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, known for his pivotal role in championing democracy in the Indian subcontinent, was born into an illustrious family in Midnapore in the then Bengal (now part of West Bengal in India) on September 8, 1892. Interestingly, his family's ancestral home was the city of Suhraward in Iraq, from which it drew its surname Suhrawardy. The founder of the family in Iraq was Sheikh Shahabuddin Suhrawardy who, from his father's side, was a descendent of Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddiqui, the first Caliph of Islam and from his mother's side, of Hazrat Ali, a son-in-law of the holy Prophet and the fourth Caliph of Islam, making him both a Siddiqui and a Syed.   The Suhrawardy family of Midnapore, however, is known for having initiated the Islamic renaissance movement in Bengal. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy's father, Barrister Zahid Suhrawardy, was knighted after his retirement from the Bar. His mother, Begum Khozesta Akhter Banu, was the first Muslim woman to pass the Senior Cambridge Examination and having graduated with honours in Persian Literature from the Indian Board of Examinations, appointed as an examiner for Urdu literature at the University of Calcutta -- the only Indian lady at the time to have received this honour. Descending from a family of pioneers, Shaheed Suhrawardy too was a spearhead of new ideas and achievements. After studying Law and Jurisprudence at Oxford University, receiving the coveted B.C.L. degree and completing his Bar-at-Law from Gray's Inn in 1918, he became the first Muslim to be elected as the Deputy Mayor of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation in 1924, with his mentor, C. R. Das, as Mayor. Additionally, he is also credited with giving birth to the idea of Bengali nationalism and of getting the Bengal Provincial Assembly to adopt the Labour Welfare Act and the Maternity Benefit Act in 1937, later to be constitutionally adopted all over India. In terms of his personality, Ataur Rahman Khan, Prime Minister of Bangladesh from March 1984 to January 1985 said, \"It was both mild and firm, cold and grim, simple and complex.\" He was also a very generous man, according to Tofazzal Hossain, editor of The Ittefaq, who wrote, \"Generally rich people forget and avoid their poor relatives. But it was different with Shaheed Suhrawardy. He searched them out, visited their cottages, never hesitated to have meals with them and helped them generously\". The same trait has also been attributed to him by one of his favourite prodigies, who himself later became a shaper of history and a champion of the people, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who remarked, \"When in Calcutta, I accidentally saw a black notebook. It contained, among others, a list of pensioners. Suhrawardy paid them a total monthly pension of Rs. 3,000. Among the pensioners, irrespective of religion, were old servants, barbers, labourers, some old writers and political workers\". Having described his mentor C. R. Das as \"a great son of Bengal\", Abul Mansur Ahmed commented, \"The greatness and magnitude of their [Das and Suhrawardy] life mission was on the same level\". Such was his devotion towards the quest for democracy and the well-being of the people that he joined politics after returning to the subcontinent in 1921 and worked tirelessly till his death. This self-sacrificing nature of his was evident in his letter to the Editor of the Daily-Ittefaq only six days prior to his passing away, when, after having all sorts of obstacles thrown in his way by those seeking power and looking to eradicate people's democratic rights, he wrote, \"If I die, I shall be happy. There is no point in living. I am of no further use to anybody -- and if use (only) to myself then this life is not worth living.\" True to those words during the 1926 riots in Calcutta, he travelled all around the city, trying to save its vulnerable people while risking his own life in the process, as he is known to have done, during the entirety of his life. In 1931, following the North Bengal flood, he worked untiringly to ease the suffering of the people where, perhaps, it was fate that led him to meet another great man in his own accord, Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani. Although the two did not always see eye-to-eye, they had considerable respect for each other and had worked together on many occasions. When the Muslim League was becoming a fascist entity, together, they formed the Jukto Front on November 13, 1953. Yet, it was Suhrawardy who had earlier played a major role for the Muslim League, particularly in its pursuit for the creation of Pakistan. For had he not won the 1946 provincial election in Bengal, given the failure of the Muslim League to win any other Muslim majority provinces, Pakistan would never have come into being. This led some to admit that \"his contributions to the creation of the new country [Pakistan] was second to none\". Yet, following the partition of India, instead of enjoying a life of position and peace in a country he helped create, when asked by the Muslims in Calcutta to stay with them during the violence of 1947, Suhrawardy sought out the great Mahatma Gandhi, and went on a peace mission with him in an attempt to stop the communal violence that threatened to engulf parts of India. Suhrawardy's steadfast attempt to end communal violence forced even his critic, Hassan Ispahani to say that \"I have not seen a man work so hard and act so swiftly to try and control conflagration as Suhrawardy did\". During the entire mission, Suhrawardy received constant threats to his life. On one occasion, when a crowd of 20,000 people came to kill him, he said, \"If you want to kill me, kill me now, but, before you kill me, you've got to give me your word that after killing me you'll kill no other Muslims\". Hearing the commotion, Gandhi came out and asked the crowd to kill him first, before killing Suhrawardy. Upon hearing this from the Mahatma, the crowd dispersed. Although Suhrawardy had held many of the highest positions in government, including the Prime Ministership of Pakistan, he was always seen as the peoples' leader. Having worked with Suhrawardy, even the great Mahatma is reported to have said, \"Jinnah, there is your statesman; Liaquat, there is your politician; Suhrawardy, there is your leader\". And it was this leadership quality of his, along with his love for the people, and his willingness to sacrifice everything at their behest, that pitted him, often, against some of the most powerful forces in Pakistan. Yet, against all these forces, his perseverance finally won him the day, when the first constitution of Pakistan was ultimately finalised on February 29, 1956, with Suhrawardy signing it as the opposition leader. Tragically, however, Suhrawardy passed away on December 5, 1963 in Beirut, where he had gone for treatment, away from the land and its people, for which he had so ardently fought. The people, however, refused to let his memories wither away. As Abul Hashim, a Bengali politician commented, \"He died a magnificent pauper, receiving the burial of an Emperor\". Even the national flag of Pakistan was lowered to half mast when he died, despite Pakistan being ruled, at the time, by some of his most severe adversaries, a rare honour granted to any opposition leader. The land which he fought for too, accepted his remains gracefully, and he was buried in the old High Court compound of Dhaka, next to the graves of A. K. Fazlul Haque and Khwaja Nazimuddin. Yet, the greatest honour that was, perhaps, bestowed on Suhrawardy, was arguably granted to him by the people, who carried on, courageously, the fight for democracy, which he had commenced, and is being carried on by them, continually, to this day.

      "text": "The impact of climate change and natural disasters cost 43.61 lakh Bangladeshi households in disaster-prone areas Tk 18,424 crore between 2009 and 2014, said the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics yesterday. In its first ever study on losses in calamities, the state agency released the report \"Bangladesh Disaster-related Statistics 2015: Climate Change and Natural Disaster Perspective\".  The report said the agriculture sector suffered a loss of Tk 8,841 crore, 48 percent of the total loss. During the period, crops of 36.2 percent households surveyed were lost, livestock of 4.76 percent, poultry of 1.21 percent, fisheries of 5.82 percent, land of 26.72 percent, and houses, kitchens and cattle sheds of 17.19 percent and trees of 8.10 percent households were damaged. \"Formulating effective plans and their implementation is imperative to facing the impacts of the natural disasters,\" said Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal while releasing the report at the National Economic Council auditorium.  The report said if there were no losses due to natural disasters at the household level, the gross domestic product output would have grown by 0.30 percent a year on average. The BBS survey found that 74 percent of the households received financial assistance from the government, 15 percent from NGOs or international organisations, four percent from the rich, three percent from business firms and two percent from relatives and friends. The BBS surveyed 143,980 households of 43.61 lakh in disaster-prone areas. About 2.2 crore people live in these disaster-prone areas, accounting for 12.64 percent of the population.  Among the causes of the natural disasters, flood was a major cause for losses, eating up Tk 4,280 crore. River and coastal erosions caused a loss of Tk 3,640 crore. Loss due to cyclones stood at Tk 2,838 crore. Atiq Rahman, executive director of the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies, a research organisation based in Dhaka, said the survey was a good beginning and pioneering initiative as it was based on a comprehensive database.  He, however, pointed out it had loopholes. He claimed that the damages to households revealed were six to 10 times less than the actual loss. He said the survey was an attempt to calculate the damages to only one component, households, among six components. \"This is an incomplete representation. \"The figure is incorrect, and should not be used as it will be misleading. The damage caused to households was taken into account.\" He said the other components were infrastructure, health, the ecosystem loss and income. The internationally acclaimed environmentalist suggested calculating the total damages caused by the natural disasters. \"So, it has to be complete for any serious decision making,\" he told The Daily Star over phone. The environmentalist said the survey should be widened, carried out every five years and made complete, as annual data does not give the actual picture. He said Bangladesh's disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation have to be integrated, instead of dealing with them separately. \"And disasters will only increase, and the cost of future damages will also increase.\"  "

Maya Apa, please help me, what am I supposed to do now to get my wife back to normal again? Is she suffering from any disease?  Dear Reader, \nThank you for your question.\nFirst of all we would like to congratulate both of you on the arrival of your baby. Lots of blessings and well wishes for him. Reader, the birth of a baby can bring a flood of different types of emotions for you and your wife, and each and every member of your family. This is not unusual for your wife to feel sad after this sudden change because motherhood can bring excitement and joy but some fear and anxiety as well. It can result in something you and your wife might not have expected-- depression. This is known as postpartum depression. Postpartum depression can begin any time during the first two months after a woman gives birth. In some cases, symptoms peak after slowly building for 3 or 4 months. There is no definite cause for this depression but physical and emotional issues sometimes play a role. Physical causes are that there is a dramatic drop in hormones which leads to a mother feeling tired, sluggish and depressed. Physical exhaustion from a mother being sleep deprived can have emotional effects, like feeling overwhelmed in handling her newborn and she may feel that she has lost control over her life which can also lead to depression.  The symptoms of postpartum depression mainly include-\n*Depressed mood and severe mood swings.\n*Avoiding family and friends. \n*Lack of confidence on being a good mother.\n*Changes of sleep and eating patterns.\n*Thoughts of harming the baby.\n*Thoughts of suicide or suicide attempts. \n*Reduced desire for sex. \n*Difficulty in concentrating.  \n As postpartum depression makes it harder to function well so early treatment is important for you, your wife, your baby as well as the rest of your family. In addition to seeking doctor's help, there are also some other ways to take care of your wife, such as- *The most important thing is to talk to your wife. How is she feeling? Encourage her to not feel guilty about her feelings and assure her this is very normal and once she recovers this will gradually diminish. *Make sure that she is meeting her basic needs. Ask her to eat and sleep properly.  *Try to offer help and encourage her to ask for help if she needs any. You can help bathe your baby or put him to sleep, while she relaxes *Tell her not to hesitate to share her feelings with you, her friends and family. Remember that your support is always vital to your wife's recovery. *Always give her some time to get some rest.  Even after taking these measures, you may feel she is not getting better, in which case you need to take her to a doctor. Reader, a more severe form of post partum mental illness is Post Partum Psychosis. This can be sudden in onset and seen within 2 weeks after childbirth. You have look for some danger signs such as- *hallucinations - usually hearing or seeing things that aren't there *delusions - thoughts or beliefs that are unlikely to be true *Feeling very irritated. *Paranoia and suspicions. *Extreme excitement or low mood. *Severe confusion. Postpartum psychosis needs immediate treatment as it can become bad very rapidly, thus leading your wife harming your baby or herself. Postpartum depression and psychosis is a medical condition. It has nothing to do with your wife's character or how good mother she is, or how much she loves her baby so never let her feel guilty about her feelings . Like any other medical condition, proper intervention, treatment and care can get her to feel better.  Hope we have helped you. If you have further queries please do ask us again. Thank you. Maya Apa. Photo: Collected\n"

Abdul Alim, 58, of Unanpur village in Gowainghat, said heavy rain in the last two days caused the flooding. \"Water from the Gowain river started to enter our home since Saturday evening.\" Another victim Joynul Miah, 65, of Jaflong tea garden in Gowainghat, said water from the hills began to flood the area since Saturday night, forcing the villagers to take shelter on road. Joynal Abedin, Jointapur upazila chairman, said floodwater entered 13 villages in the upazila and around 1,200 families were affected. On information, Water Development Board officials visited the areas. Abdul Hakim Chowdhury, chairman of Gowainghat upazila, said road communications between the upazila headquarters and Pachim Jaflong, Purbo Jaflong, Rustompur, Dhobari and Lengura unions remained snapped. Dykes at Nayeakhel, Bhittikhel, Thubang, Baladara and Shurkhel had already been damaged. As water level in the Gowain and Shari rivers was rising, thousands of families living by the riversides were in fear of losing their crops and homes, he added. Joynal Abedin, deputy commissioner of Sylhet, said they informed their higher authorities about the matter."

His efforts appear to be generating more anger than interest, however - and even if he did find a receptive audience overseas, any financial assistance he receives would be a violation of US law. Even the act of asking could get the Trump camp a rebuke from the US government. Members of parliament in the UK, Iceland, Canada and Australia have reported that they are being inundated on their official government emails accounts with fund-raising pleas from the Trump campaign - some from the candidate himself and others from his sons. One pitch praised British voters for voting to leave the European Union, heralding that they had \"taken their country back\" - a line Trump himself used while talking to the press at one of his golf courses in Scotland. SNP MP Natalie McGarry tweeted a copy of an email signed by one of Donald Trump's sons and offered her own, sharper reply. \"Given his rhetoric on migrants, refugees and immigration, it seems quite extraordinary that he would be asking foreign nationals for money; especially people who view his dangerous divisiveness with horror,\" she wrote. At least three Icelandic politicians have received emails condemning \"crooked\" Hillary Clinton and pledging to match any contributions to his campaign, according to Iceland Monitor. Australian MP Tim Watts tweets that he has received at least four emails since Friday. US law prohibits a political campaign from \"knowingly\" soliciting or accepting donations from foreign nationals. On Wednesday two US public interest groups announced they were filing a formal complaint with the Federal Elections Commission - which oversees US election law.\n\"The FEC needs to investigate how many of these illegal solicitations were sent, to whom they were sent, whether any illegal foreign contributions have been received and, if so, whether the contributions have been returned,\" Democracy 21 president Fred Wertheimer said in a press release announcing the complaint filed in co-operation with the Campaign Legal Center. The groups allege that the Trump campaign should have been aware that there were foreign nationals on its email list - and that it continued to send such emails even after the media began reporting on instances of such solicitations. They contend that the FEC should \"impose appreciate sanctions\" (ie fines) on the Trump campaign and ensure that it avoids future violations. Most Americans are all-too-familiar with urgent-sounding campaign fund-raising emails that flood in-boxes during the seemingly endless presidential campaign season... We need your help! Our opponent is (lying/cheating/surging)! Send us your money or political doomsday will be upon us! It's a game the Donald Trump campaign has only recently begun playing, however. The New York billionaire relied heavily on free media coverage and personal loans over the course of his successful Republican primary campaign and often boasted of how he was not reliant on traditional campaign contributions.\nThe prospect of a match-up with Democrat Hillary Clinton, who has around $42m (PS32m) in her campaign war chest, has led the Trump camp to change strategy, however. The presumptive nominee recently has held high-dollar fundraisers and sent out a flurry of emails asking for donations. The foreign missives (which are likely the result of poorly culled lists and not a ham-handed attempt to violate US law) indicate that the gears of the newly instituted Trump money-generating machine are grinding unevenly. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to BBC requests for a comment. Fund-raising email lists are among a political campaign's most prized possession. They powered Barack Obama to victory in 2008 and fuelled Bernie Sanders's surprisingly persistent Democratic primary challenge to Clinton earlier this year. A well-crafted pitch sent to millions of followers can fill campaign coffers with money that can be directly used by the campaign (as opposed to big-dollar donations to supposedly \"unaffiliated\" political committees). The Trump campaign reports that its efforts have brought in $11m in \"just a few days\". But it also seems to have generated some embarrassing press along the way."

      "text": "The earth rotates on its axis. The seasons change, and my soul throbs to the rhythm of the Bengal delta. The elements of air, water, earth, and fire call out to me with the first whiff of the Bengali New Year. As I yearn for release from the sweltering Chaitra heat, the month of Baishakh beckons with low, growling thunder and the distant, jagged flash of silver lightning. I look up at the wide, blue-black canopy of the sky for the tumultuous harbinger of Pahela Baishakh, the heavenly benediction in the form of the approaching Kalboishaki. My trembling body anticipates the glorious delight of the gift of dark cumulous clouds carrying florets of drenching rain, and my long tresses float in the wild stream of the furious nor'wester. The howling  treetops  surrender their  weak and dead limbs in the wake of the storm's epic sweep, and Bengal reverberates to the song of renewal and rebirth.  I hear the red soil of Bengal ripple with the tangible, audible cry of the Kalboishaki. Pellets of hailstones hit thatched and tiled and corrugated tin roofs, and the sodden ground turns into a field of snaky, muddy rivulets. Nature energises the blood, and  the village folk shake their lethargy to embrace laughter and productive labour.  Mother-earth calls, 'Daub your huts  with warm, wet clay, scour your earthen pots and pans with fistfuls of squelching alluvial mud, slake your sun-burnt, parched  skins by soaking in the bold rainfall. Inhale the smoky, intoxicating fumes of damp, native clay, and know your  homestead. Till the field, and plant the paddy, and stand at sundown to gaze lovingly at the glistening horizon. Settle accounts, pay your debts, close  the tattered cover of the old year's ledger, and welcome the New Year with the ritual opening of a pristine red Halkhata.'  Woefully, for me, this  Pahela Baishakh, on April 14 2016, in the New Year 1423 of the Bengali calendar, my Halkhata will begin with the record of eternal parting. On Pahela Baishakh, my beloved father's body would have been fused with native clay, having lain in his final resting place for eighteen days and nights. The Potter had finally finished moulding him on the Wheel of life. The time had come for the soul's vessel, vassal to the Almighty, to return to the place whence it came: \"Time's  wheel  runs  back  or stops : Potter and clay endure.\"  'Endurance' is the master-narrative of Bengali folk. Flood and famine, and nature's other seasonal, violent vicissitudes, have made us resilient and resolute. The unique geography and climate of the delta have given us slight, lithe, lissome physiques. Fed since ancient times  upon plentiful rice and fresh sweet-water fish, Bengali folk have not bred swarthy warriors,   but charmed travelers and temporary sojourners with arts and crafts. Potters and weavers and metalworkers and goldsmiths create dazzling, intricately-designed artifacts praised  and highly prized by all who look upon them. Every harvest, or spring, autumn, and winter festival is a colourful carnival, with music and dance and ritual offerings and prayers. Each festival in Bengal is transformational; a symbolic, collective renewal of vows of bondage to red clay,  a secular or communal expression of gratitude in the midst of recurring adversity. Every festival becomes a living, dynamic document of the soul's survival, an assertion of joyful commitment and continuity; a mela, boshonto mela, Baishakhi mela, rongomela.\n Clay sculpture has dominated the visual culture of Bengal since the dawn of the Indus Valley civilisation. In the absence of other hard raw materials like rocks and stone, the porous red clay of the Lower Gangetic delta became the primary ingredient for making household cooking pots and storage urns, as well as for building bricks and roofing tiles. Fired and glazed pottery became the expertise of skilled artisans, while unfired, sun-baked clay objects were commodities of daily life. Clay figures, animal as well as anthropomorphic, and both votive and decorative  images, have archeological, historically located origins. For example, the iconic Bankura horse has become representative of Bengali folk art, even as scholarly debate surrounds the topic of whether the horse was indigenous to Bengal or was brought here from Persia or Arabia. Clay has truly been called 'at once the most humble and the most exalted' among earth's raw materials. Indeed, while clay has been integral to the life of rural Bengal for centuries, modern times has seen the value of terra cotta art and pottery  rise among urban dwellers. Especially before Pahela Baishakh, patronage of the work of communities of rural potters through open exhibitions of their artistic and more affordable household items encourages buyers to decorate their homes as well as stack their kitchen cabinets with urns and pots, clay mugs and cups, and bowls and platters for serving sumptuous Bengali cuisine. This new trend among the well-to-do in cities has revived a cottage industry which was on the verge of decline. It has made pottery once again a self-sustaining avocation for the poor, skilled kumar whose existence is threatened by the ubiquitous, cheap, non-bio-degradable  plastic and melamine goods. Today, Bangladeshi pottery and high-end glazed or unglazed pieces are also prized export items.  For the average Bengali householder, certain food items are unimaginable unless they are set in clay bowls. First and foremost, especially in my home, Mishti doi (sweet curd), so much a part of Bengali hospitality, cannot be imagined without its clay bowl container. And, of course, we all know how drinking water remains cool in clay pitchers in our semi-tropical climate. Just as cotton fabric lets the skin breathe during the stifling hot weather,  porous clay allows food items and fluids to retain their cool freshness. In fact, the rich earthy aroma of clay can enhance the pleasure felt in the tongue's taste-buds. Even today, I often hear how food cooked in baked clay utensils has a more satisfying earthy flavor, similar to the scent exuded by the smokiness cherished by aficionados of food cooked in  wood-burning stoves. Today, as I write about the earthiness of clay, about  Bengal's 'soul' in enduring clay, the little girl that I once was comes alive in my memory. I remember with acute longing the few school holidays spent in our village in Dhamrai. I remember the fields of yellow mustard flowers, and the lush green paddy fields with the ribbed raised edges of earth upon which I walked foot by foot to gather the feathery tall wild grass. I remember the festive atmosphere in the open inner courtyard with mud-baked 'choolas' shooting smoke and flames, where the old grand-aunt, or her daughter and daughters-in-law sat on low wooden piris and cooked bhapa pitha, or chitoi pitha on wintry mornings. But, alas, those days are so far in the past that today my tongue is dry and cannot  recreate the essence of that lost childhood palate.  Today, I feel I can understand the 'soul' of clay by enduring the pain of loss, by grappling with the travails of earthly strife. I find ample reward in inhaling the exuberance and the aroma of the rainfall on red clay in my front-yard. As I breathe in the fragrance of wet clay, memories of my long journey with my father beside me keeps me resolute and strong for the coming year. I await the Kalboishaki with calm fortitude.

      "text": "No one in the history of the Kingdom of Thailand has done so much to improve the well-being of its people as His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, also known as Rama IX. He has initiated literally thousands of development projects that have greatly benefited the country and its people. His reign spanned the terms of more than 30 governments, several military regimes, coups and numerous coup attempts, and even the defeat of the communist threat that raged through Southeast Asia a few decades ago. \"We shall reign with righteousness for the benefits and happiness of the Siamese people.\" This declaration, spoken by His Majesty at his coronation ceremony was his first public pledge to promote the welfare of all his subjects. Throughout his 65-year reign he has fulfilled this promise to the letter. Early on His Majesty was inspired by the example of his parents to work tirelessly to improve the lives of the Thai people. Although most of his childhood was spent in the West, he was taught to be aware of his roots and his debt to the motherland. This attitude formed a solid foundation for a deep understanding of Thai society. In the early days of his reign His Majesty made many visits to rural areas throughout Thailand. Accompanied by Her Majesty Queen Sirikit, His Majesty visited the least developed areas of the country to see how the people lived. The royal couple travelled to every part of the country, visiting villagers and learning of their living conditions, problems and needs at first hand. His Majesty would then begin the process of devising schemes and projects to resolve their troubles and improve their condition. Scenes of His Majesty sitting on the ground or standing shoulder to shoulder with his subjects, engaged in conversation, became a familiar sight that touched all Thai people. To His Majesty, the people's problems are also his, and so he has never stopped striving to make their lives better. It is for that reason the people proclaimed their King \"Father of the Nation\" and the monarchy has become a rock solid institution, ensconced firmly in the hearts of the Thai people. His Majesty truly deserves to be called the Developer King for his dedication to alleviating the people's hardships and improving their quality of life. Royal Development Projects\n The Royal Development Projects (RDPs) were directly inspired by the insight His Majesty gained while visiting rural areas. He realized that any projects that truly improved the lives of the people must go hand in hand with protection of the environment and sustainable use of natural resources. The first initiative to help people was initiated in 1951, when His Majesty authorized the Department of Fisheries to acquire Tilapia mosambica fish from Penang through the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization. The fish were initially raised in the pond at the Ambarra Villa of the Dusit Palace in Bangkok. On November 7, 1953, His Majesty distributed the fingerlings to village and district leaders throughout the country for propagation and further distribution among the rural people in order to provide them with an alternative source of protein. The first RDP which directly emphasized rural development emerged in 1952 when His Majesty donated a number of bulldozers to the Naresuan Border Patrol Police unit for construction of a road leading to Huai Mongkol Village in Hua Hin district of Prachuap Khiri Khan province. This was to enable the villagers to easily commute and transport their produce for sale in markets outside the village. Since 1952, His Majesty initiated more than 3,000 innovative programmes in agriculture, environment, public health, water resources, communications, public welfare, occupational promotion and education with the aim of easing the lives of Thai people. Some of the most important are as follows: Royal Rain Project\n His Majesty is often associated with life-giving rain because of his pioneering work in cloud seeding techniques. Since 1971, the methods he developed have been used to bring drought relief to farmers and to increase water reservoirs, earning international patents and interest from foreign countries. Moisture Retention Dams To maximize the use of Thailand's annual monsoon rains, His Majesty designed a system of small \"check-dams,\" which regulate the flow of water. The creation of multiple small reservoirs gives farmers immediate benefits and also replenishes groundwater. Royal Projects In 1969, the King introduced a comprehensive program to assist northern hill tribe people engaged in unsustainable farming practices. By training the hill tribe communities in the production of various handicrafts, these programs have raised their income and their prospects, and at the same time have benefited the environment. Pa Sak Jolasid Dam Project\n To help the farmers of Thailand's central plains to exploit fully the waters of the Pa Sak River, His Majesty initiated a development project that created a new reservoir for water conservation and controlled irrigation. The dam has also helped with flood prevention on the outskirts of Bangkok. New Theory on Managing Agricultural Land Combining concepts of water management with local control, His Majesty developed a strategy that promotes individual household reservoirs over large communal ones, maximizing versatility while minimizing costs. Overall agricultural production is boosted without the need for public funds. Use of Vetiver to Prevent Soil Erosion To help stop the effects of soil erosion, the King initiated a program to plant certain varieties of vetiver grass, known for its ability to reduce siltation and stabilize soil. The systematic application of the program has proven effective in maximizing productivity and conserving precious water. The Chaipattana Aerator Concerned with the quality of water in the Kingdom, His Majesty developed a device that keeps water oxygenated and healthy. Its simple design and low cost make it easy to build and maintain, thus facilitating wide application nationwide. Pak Phanang Project To stem the deterioration of the naturally fertile Pak Phanang River basin due to unmanaged population growth, His Majesty initiated co-operation between government agencies to use more effective agricultural resources, maximize economic gain, and reduce harmful environmental practices. Renewable Energy Long before the need for renewable biofuels was widely apparent, His Majesty was actively researching the resource potential of locally-made palm oil. The resulting biodiesel has become a standard additive in the nation's fuel, and its local sourcing is an inspiration for ongoing research.    "

      "text": "Bhabadah, often called the \"Sorrow of Jessore\", where water is a symbol of suffering, hunger, disease, and death. The perennial waterlogging triggered from Bhabadah point affects mainly three upazilas -- Abhaynagar, Manirampur and Keshabpur -- home to some 10 lakh people. This year, almost six lakh inhabitants were affected when the flood situation was at its worst during the rainy season. Five months later, things have improved but many farmers won't still be able to grow crops. But what's the cause of Bhabadah's woes? Is there no solution? There is. Why is it not happening then? In this two-part story [the last part today], WASIM BIN HABIB and TUHIN SHUBHRA ADHIKARY chronicle Bhabadah's saga at a time when, with much of the vast land still under this year's floodwaters, many beel people are wondering how they will prepare for the next rain.  After most of the Bhabadah rivers silted up, things turned real bad in 1983. Several villages and much of the low-lying area went under water after a heavy rain. It was the worst waterlogging since the embankments were built in the 1960s, and the water stagnation lasted several months. As a quick solution, people opened channels in the embankments. They hoped, firstly, the waters would drain out to the rivers, and secondly, flooding rivers would leave sediments and raise the beel floor every year, which won't go under water easily. It worked. The stagnated water gushed out to the rivers. Within weeks the navigability of the rivers improved. Locals called their indigenous water management system \"Joaradhar\" (a place for tidal waters), which has now come to be officially known as Tidal River Management (TRM). Between 1983 and 1997, the people living in beel areas used this technique in Singair Beel, Dahuri Beel and Beel Dakatia. The waterlogging problems improved in the areas. The government in 1997 adopted TRM as a viable solution and decided to apply it in all the beels in phases. The waterlogging situation improved a lot even after partial implementation of TRM until 2013 (except for 2005-06). Rains during this period flooded the farmlands but did not enter homes. But influential locals, especially the shrimp hatchery (gher) owners were dead against this plan. Also, some flaws in the TRM projects created rifts among the locals. FATE SEALED BY MAN People of Bhabadah often blame their fate for their sufferings and call this God's \"punishment\". But their fate, if it has anything to do with waterlogging, has been sealed by man. In the 1990s, a phenomenal growth in the numbers of shrimp ghers or hatcheries in the beels took up most of the lands. Each of these beels has about 40 percent of khas land. Today, most of these lands \"belong\" to shrimp owners. They have also managed, sometimes by force or trickery, to lease hundreds of acres of private land from farmers. \"They are locally influential and have political links,\" said Probir Kumar Goshwami, executive engineer at the Water Development Board (WDB) in Jessore. Information on the exact size of the shrimp business there is not available, but locals say it's a multi-million dollar business a year. \"Since the ghers involve a lot of money, owners often obstruct government projects,\" said Iqbal Kabir Jahid, a campaigner and also politburo member of the Workers Party of Bangladesh. The cancellation of a TRM project in Beel Kapalia is a prime example of their money and muscle power.   The project was launched on May 1, 2012. On June 2, parliament Whip Sheikh Abdul Wahab went to the area to inaugurate a peripheral embankment, only to come under an attack by gher owners and their goons. The whip's car was set on fire and his men were beaten up. The attack forced the government to initially suspend and then eventually cancel the project in 2015 for \"complexity and slow implementation.\" Some project officials and contractors also benefit from the delay because it means more money, locals alleged.  \"The problem has been kept alive for decades because it serves the interest of some corrupt government officials and influential people,\" said Jahid. \"To these people, Bhabadah is the proverbial goose that lays golden eggs. Governments change, but the faces of power do not,\" he said. Consider Khulna-Jessore Drainage Rehabilitation Project (KJDRP), one of the biggest projects taken up to address river drainage and waterlogging problem in the entire southwest region, including Bhabadah. The Tk 272-crore project implemented between 1995 and 2004 included massive dredging work, construction of regulators, dams and embankments. But the project did more harm than good. The drainage system in the region worsened and several rivers died, The Daily Star found in 2006 when Bhabadah had the worst ever waterlogging.  The project failed because it did not consider TRM as a solution to the waterlogging problem, said Ranjit Kumar Bawali of Dumurtola in Abhaynagar, convener of the Sangram Committee. He has been campaigning for a solution ever since the problem began. In 1997, the WDB finally included the TRM system in the project, first applying it in Beel Bharat Bhayena in Keshabpur and in Beel Kedaria in 2002. There was a relief from waterlogging in these two beels. But Beel Kedaria's TRM project stopped in 2005 after gher owners, led by BNP leader Nazmus Sadat, wrote to the district administration, saying their croplands were being damaged by the water entering the beels through the openings. But in fact, they did it to protect their ghers, campaigners say. Sadat claimed that people were against the project as they did not get due compensation for land acquisition.  In 2006, the WDB introduced the TRM project in Beel Khukshia in Keshabpur under a project and decided to apply it in other beels. The project was not implemented in the entire beel area and people living outside the embankments were waterlogged. The project dragged on for an extra four years after the completion date of 2008 and farmers could not grow any crops. Besides, more than a fourth land owner didn't get the promised compensation due to procedural flaws. So, agitated people closed the cut-point of the TRM in January 2013, bringing an end to the project. Even though such resentment contributed to the project failure, the gher owners were the main stumbling block to the TRM project in Beel Kapalia. Until recently, they had the full backing of former Manirampur upazila chairman Shawpan Bhattacharjee, now an independent lawmaker. \"There was no deadline for the TRM projects. Compensation was uncertain and poor. Considering all this, I was with the protesters [gher owners],\" said the Jessore-5 MP. \"But as the government has now met all these conditions, we all want implementation of TRM projects.\" Due to such rifts, politics and influence of the gher owners, the WDB did not implement any TRM or river dredging projects until last year except for an emergency excavation project, said an official at the WDB in Jessore, preferring to remain unidentified. This year's waterlogging worsened because the 21-vent sluice gate at Bhabadah point had to be shut for a month for the Tk 1.7-crore project. But around 15km of riverbed of the Hari silted up even more because of lost flow from the beel. So when the rain came, it could not hold the waters, locals say. THE REMEDY This new crisis seems to have patched up the rifts somewhat. Locals, political leaders, government officials, campaigners and independent experts all agree that TRM, if implemented in a cyclic, planned manner, is the answer to this problem. Even some gher owners now privately admit this.  \"TRM is an effective method, but it has to continue. Otherwise, the rivers would silt up again like in 2006 and this year,\" said Prof M Shahjahan Mondal of the Institute of Water and Flood Management at the Buet. But he warned that although TRM would bring some immediate respites, it should not be seen as a permanent solution. \"The authorities should also continue river dredging every year and maintain the sluice gates,\" said Shahjahan, who visited the area in late October. Probir Kumar Goshwami, executive engineer at the WDB in Jessore, agrees, but says, \"If we want to keep the rivers and canals active, we have to excavate around 90km of the river network up to Shibsha river round the year, which is extremely expensive.\" Asked about the alleged corruption by some officials, he said he could not comment about the past. But there is no scope for corruption since 2011, when a new mechanism was devised to fight corruption. Early this year, the government decided to implement TRM in Beel Kapalia. As part of the project, a survey is now looking into how to implement TRM more effectively. But the actual work won't begin in another year, according to officials. That will mean another year of misery for Hari Chand Mandal or anyone else in these beels. Caught up in this trap called Bhabadah, they have lived with waters for much too long. They want a solution before the next rain.  "

      "text": "RISING sea levels will definitely be the biggest threat for Bangladesh among all the external drivers related to climate change. Sea level rise affects the coastal zone of Bangladesh and its geometry in a number of ways including inundation, erosion and saline water intrusion into the water table. Climate change induced potential rise in sea level will aggravate the risks to coastal zones. In particular, the poorest people living in the vulnerable regions are the most susceptible to climate-induced risks and will continue to suffer the most. It is therefore important to know about the level of impact due to sea level rise (SLR) on Bangladesh. Results from a recent collaborative study of BUET with Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS) and Institute of Water Modelling (IWM), funded by the Department of Environment (DOE), showed that trends of water level rise of the 18 tidal gauge stations were determined for a period of 30 years. It can be found that the overall trend in the coastal zone is 6-20 mm per year, which is about 2 to 5 times higher than the global average. Spatial variation of sea level rise was found along the coast, and the highest trend has been observed in the Chittagong and Cox's Bazar region compared to other two coastal sub-zones of the country. Several recent studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, provide sea level rise projections for the world. Over the last century, global mean of sea level rise was stated as 19 +- 2 cm. Higher rapid sea-level rise is now projected to be 28-98cm by 2100. In the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) in Paris, a historic agreement to combat climate change in order to achieve a low carbon, resilient and sustainable world was signed by the representatives of 195 nations in Paris. The purpose of this historic agreement is to reduce the level of greenhouse emissions to restrict the increase in global average temperature within 2 degree Celsius above the pre-industrial level. However, different projections scenarios of IPCC showed that the increase of average temperature from the pre-industrial period is about 0.78 degree Centigrade. For very high emissions, IPCC predicts a global rise of sea level will be 52-98 cm by the year 2100 even with aggressive emission reduction; a rise of 28-61 cm is predicted. IPCC reports also note that a collapse of the marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could potentially add up to a further several tenths of a metre of sea level rise, independent of scenario, and that estimate could be around 0.5m. This additional amount, when combined with the upper limit of the highest-emission-scenario (RCP8.5) likely range, gives a value of sea level rise by 2100 of around 1.5 m, not including potential local variations or subsidence. Considering all these risks, it is very important to know the probable areas which are under threat of inundation in the coastal zone of Bangladesh with sea level rise in the near future. A four year long research project entitled 'High End Climate Impact and Extremes (HELIX)' is currently on-going at BUET, where the European Union provide funding under the Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013, to carry out the study for assessing impacts of the extreme climate change in Bangladesh. Under the HELIX project, coastal inundation due to sea level rise has been assessed using coastal modelling. A widely used flow simulation model Delft3D has been set up for a part of the complex Bangladesh delta. After validation, the model has been simulated to prepare an inundation map and to calculate affected areas and affected population for 0.5m, 1m and 1.5m sea level rise. According to the Coastal Zone Policy report of the Government of Bangladesh, 19 districts out of 64 are in the coastal zone, covering a total of 147 Upazilas. Of these 19 districts, 12 districts are contiguous with the sea or lower estuary directly. The coastal zone covers 47,201 sq.km land area, which is 32 percent of the total landmass of the country. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) report of 2003, the total population living in the coastal zone is 35.1 million, i.e. 28 percent of the total population of the country. The area under sea water inundation will be changed under different sea level rise conditions. It has been found that 0.5m, 1m and 1.5m SLR will inundate about 4.3 percent, 8.4 percent and 11.3 percent of the coastal areas of Bangladesh. The number of affected people will be 2.5 lakh, 6 lakh and 8 lakh for the 0.5 m, 1m and 1.5m SLR. The biggest threat of SLR is on the largest mangrove forest of the world, the Sundarbans, as it is not protected by the coastal polders. It has been found that about 12 percent, 43 percent and 60 percent of the Sundarbans will be inundated for the 0.5m, 1m and 15m SLR. As the Sundarbans is very important from ecological, environmental, geological and economic point of view for Bangladesh, its inundation patterns with different SLR conditions have profound impact. Note: The scenarios presented in this article are indicative of the expected range of changes of the coastal inundation. Mr. Abdur Rahman Tazkia worked as a Research Assistant at BUET to simulate the coastal model and prepared the figures.

      "text": "Tawfique AliNovember 06, 2016 Over the years, The Daily Star has repeatedly and tirelessly raised its voice against the slow but certain death of the rivers around Dhaka due to encroachment, dumping of pollutants and lack of dredging. The government, parliament and judiciary also responded to our concerns, taking many an initiative in the last seven years. But nothing could stop this systematic destruction of four rivers --Turag, Buriganga, Balu and Shitalakhya -- the lifelines of the capital. Powerful, rich and ruthless, these river-gobblers have no difficulty manoeuvring the legal system and the land administration, and \"managing\" law enforcement agencies. They remain unstoppable with the Turag fast approaching to be history. In this report, Tawfiq Ali details the persistent neglect of our river custodian in clearing four major encroachments that are seen as the cause of Turag's imminent demise. In the end, nobody would save the Turag river. Left at the mercy of ruthless land grabbers who continue to ravage one of Dhaka's lifelines, the river is only a shadow of its once mighty self. \"We are dismayed by the slow death of the river. It, in our childhood, used to be a mighty river and we fondly called it the Kahar Daria,\" said Hafizul Islam, an elderly farmer with ancestral homestead in Machhimpur mouja of Tongi.    Today, with unbridled grabbing of the river foreshore by \"land claimants,\" the river is barely surviving. It has become a lean flow like a drainage ditch, he lamented. Fresh water, fish resource, marine ecology and panoramic waterfront of the river are all gone with encroachments, industrial pollution and random structures, said Shafia Begum who works in an NGO. She commutes regularly to the city from Ashulia along the bank of the Turag.        Even three decades ago, the river had all its splendour, vitality, serene beauty and wide navigability, says Shafia, who was born in Savar. \"The number of grabbers multiplied only over the last half a decade. \"The river grabbers are powerful and rich, and apparently mighty,\" she added, \"the grabbing has been indiscriminate and appears unstoppable.\" Abdur Razzaq, a fish wholesaler and inhabitant of Abdullahpur, said the river has been killed over the past decade, \"...while we have seen feeble attempts in the name of saving it.\" During several visits in the past few weeks, this correspondent saw the earth filling of the river's foreshores, the part of a shore between high- and low-water marks. Not only existing river grabbers, but also scores of fresh \"land claimants\" were busy with their work. The areas grabbed some half a decade ago now stand covered with plants, trees and structures. This Daily Star correspondent, since April 2011, has been following the destruction of the river. River laws and repeated High Court orders fell flat, it appears. Half a dozen official custodians are supposed to save the 38km river stretch from Kholamora to Teramukh across Ashulia and Tongi. A 2009 landmark High Court judgment delineated detailed measures on how to recover the ailing rivers from land grabbers and save them from pollution. The judgement ordered the administration to demarcate the boundary of five dying Dhaka rivers -- the Buriganga, the Balu, the Turag, the Shitalakkhya and the Dhaleshwari. This became the death warrant for the rivers. Demarcation pillars were set up along the river banks during the lean flow of dry season waterline excluding a roughly estimated 2,500 acres of river foreshores and wetlands. It lured hundreds of fresh grabbers to start gobbling up the excluded river areas with massive earth filling. The entire stretch of the foreshore wetlands of the Turag, between Dhour Bridge and Shinnirtek along the river embankment road across Birulia, has been indiscriminately filled up with sand dumped by dozens of dredgers around the clock. Barely five years ago was this area was part of the river flow. The Daily Star has seen three satellite images of three sites of the Turag, one with Uttara-16 and Savar across the river, one with Uttara-18 and Savar across the river, and Diabari and Kaundia Ghat across the river, where the river has been choked by grabbers. The widths of the river there are around 30 metre. The river widths across Mirpur, Birulia, Goranchatbari and Ashulia are also about 30 metre.   Today, claimants on the foreshore wetlands include concrete mixture plants, sand traders, real-estate developers, plant nursery owners, recreation clubs, private universities, mosques and Nou Sramik (river transport workers') League, a pro-Awami League body. Some half-hearted and ill-equipped eviction drives failed to complete any eviction of major encroachers.     KAMARPARA BRIDGE\n A land claimant occupied 1.34 acres of the Turag near Kamarpara Bridge in Machhimpur mouja of Tongi with concrete pillars and heavily reinforced retaining walls. None of the half a dozen authorities designated to protect rivers, wetlands and environment stopped this river occupation.    It required a High Court order on July 24, 2014, for the BIWTA and Gazipur and Dhaka district administration to act. On August 26 that year, the district administration authorities and BIWTA jointly embarked on a three-day drive to remove the huge earth filling. But they called off the drive mid way. They had said that they could not procure the right equipment nor could they move tugboats and pontoons loaded with bulldozers and excavators up the river because of several low clearance bridges.   After keeping quiet for a couple of years, the land claimant erected the fencing again and got the encroached area covered with plants and trees to make it look like an ordinary piece of land.  DHOUR BRIDGE\n There were two similar incidents of encroachments near Dhour Bridge. Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) on March 10, 2014, \"equipped\" with 10 men with six sledgehammers came to evict a gigantic under-construction spinning mill and a huge wall on a 9,292-square metre designated flood-flow zone of the Turag near the bridge in Bhadam mouja.  All they could do was to knock a hole in the wall. The factory owner promised he on his own would bring down the rest and the demolishing team left satisfied. The factory owner then obtained a High Court stay order on the eviction for four months and finished building the factory. Rajuk did nothing.  An unidentified claimant on the other side of the river had filled a huge chunk of the river and wetland near Dhour Bridge in Bhakral mouja choking the river.  The BIWTA and the Gazipur district administration carried out an eviction drive but this too was a mere show as the ill-prepared and ill-equipped BIWTA team could only remove some timber and concrete pillars of a wall.  BIRULIA BRIDGE\n The story of unhindered river grabbing is the same on both sides of this bridge. Grabbers took advantage of the river boundary pillars that excluded its foreshores. Half a kilometre north of Birulia Bridge, an unidentified encroacher filled nearly an acre of the river around three years ago. No eviction drive was carried out there ever. It now stands as a land with plantation and fencing with an ownership claim of a real-estate developer.       WHAT AUTHORITIES SAY SM Alam, deputy commissioner of Gazipur, said, \"The river encroachers come back immediately after being evicted and we don't have adequate manpower to constantly guard against that.  \"But at present, there is no incidents of grabbing in the Turag,\" he claimed.    Rajuk chief town planner Md Sirajul Islam said they could not prevent earth filling of wetlands and river foreshores as demarcation pillars set up by the district administration authorities excluded the foreshore, an action that offered the river grabbers the chance for grabbing. The BIWTA in some cases issued licences to use the foreshore that, in a way, encouraged and smoothed the way for land grabbers, he said. \"We have too little logistic support and manpower to safeguard the river wetlands,\" he said.     Kamrul Hasan Sohag, deputy town planner of Rajuk, said they just served around 20 notices and filed two complaints with police against the encroachers of Turag river wetlands. They did not go for filing cases against them or carrying out eviction drives, as \"the higher authorities did not instruct them to do so,\" he said.        Gulger Ali, BIWTA joint director and port officer of Dhaka River Port (Sadarghat), said none of the existing businesses on the river foreshores had BIWTA licences.  Why don't they evict the river grabbers then? Because faulty demarcation pillars had not been rectified yet, he said. They have found nearly 1,000 pillars set up at wrong locations along the Turag and the Balu and the issue has been kept unresolved since 2012.   He claimed that there were cases of encroachment into the Turag river only at four places along the embankment stretching from Shinnirtek to Dhour Bridge and that, \"There are no other incidents of encroachments on the Turag beyond the existing demarcation pillars.\"  When he was told of specific incidents near Kamarpara Bridge and in Birulia, he stood his ground.   Pressed further on why they do not protect the foreshores on the basis of a map jointly prepared by the BIWTA and district administration in 2006, he said, \"We can do that only if the shipping minister asks us to do so.\""

Twenty villages in Phultola and Sagornal unions, eight villages in Gualbari union, five in Joyfornagor union, 15 in Pashchim Juri union under Juri upazila; and 12 villages under Bhuksimul union in Kulaura upazila have been effectively cut off by the floodwaters. Shahab Uddin, lawmaker from the area, said yesterday that he had talked with the officials of the Water Development Board (WDB) and urged them to repair the damaged portion of the embankments as soon as possible. Juri Upazila Parishad Chairman Gulshanara Chowdhury said distribution of relief materials is urgently needed in the affected areas. Kishore Roy Chowdhury, vice chairman of the parishad, said the authorities concerned should take immediate steps to repair the embankment of Juri River. Roads and seedbeds of the areas are submerged and fish in around 200 ponds have been washed away by the floodwaters, he added. Foizur Rob, executive engineer of WDB, Moulvibazar, said they would seek funds to repair the embankments. Meanwhile, due to heavy rain and the onrush of water from the, around 32 villages in Kulaura, Juri and Borolekha upazilas of the district were flooded last week. Thousands of people in these villages now face an acute crisis of safe drinking water as flood waters are yet to recede. According to the upazila authorities, at least 1500 houses in the river basin areas of were washed away by the flood. \"We have already sent the list of the houses lost to the district administration."

      "text": "\"Let me tell you a few stories from the pre-historic era,\" Enam Bhai clears his throat sitting in his glass walled cubicle with the fellow photographers working for The Daily Star. The storyteller here is Sk Enamul Haq, popularly known as Enam Bhai, our chief photographer who has been with The Daily Star from the very beginning. \"Pre-historic?\" I laugh. \"They took place in a time when there was no eight storied Daily Star Centre in Farmgate. When there was no need for a well-equipped graphics section and no wide range of digital cameras,\" he continues in a dramatic voice. \"There was, however, one clunky desktop computer, a few 35 mm film cameras, and some large pasting boards to work on the newspaper layout. And there were pitch-black darkrooms, and this is a story about how we got freed from these matchbox sized darkrooms when digital cameras came into our lives,\" he continues. Back then, the journey of clicking the right picture to delivering it to the newsroom was quite a long one. \"We started off as a black and white newspaper when we had a team of four photographers- AKM Mohsin, SK Enamul Haque, Shafiuddin Ahmed Ditu and Hiru. After capturing the pictures, we would spend hours in the darkroom, standing in sweat and congestion, in suspense and joy to develop the films into negatives. And then we would put the negatives onto the photosensitive papers that make the final print. After the final washing, once they were dry, we would put a caption on the back of it and turn them in. Such a long process!\" Enam Bhai remembers his eyes closed. \"We were the luckiest to have the first air-condition set up in our darkroom in the history of The Daily Star,\" he adds laughingly. While these days we take many photographs to get that one perfect shot, back in the days of film photography, there was barely any space for a second chance. \"A typical roll of film would cost 10 taka and used to have only 36 exposures, and on top of that we had to spend those very carefully. Using just your one perfect sense, we were required to capture that one moment with one click,\" he continues. \"In 1991, when Lieutenant General (Retd.) Hussain Muhammad Ershad was given a prison sentence; I was there to take his photograph crowded with many other photographers. My challenge was to take a photo of him in one shot, which I did and later shared with other photographers.\" \"We had run into hard times a couple of times,\" Enam Bhai recalls. \"Unmindful for a moment, you might end up having an over exposed photograph and  uncommon thing to happen.\"   \"You couldn't back up film; if something happened to your rolls between shooting and developing, all your work goes in vain. It happened once to our fellow photographer who went to Mymensingh to photograph the devastating flood and when he came back he discovered that nothing had been captured in his film.\" I gasp in wonder, not daring to ask what happened after that. There was a growing market demand for coloured photos, when the Daily Star's closest competitor started printing on coloured newsprints. \"After moving into our Dhanmondi office in 1993, every Thursday, we started publishing colour photographs on the front and back pages. In 2004, finally we got our first and only digital camera that caused a stir among the photographers,\" says Enam Bhai. \"However we used to have only one digital camera which all of us made sure to share together. Eventually that number increased.\" In last 25 years, Enam Bhai agrees that as an organisation we have undergone extraordinary changes, and that this is particularly true for the layout artists. \"Now we do the page layout of the newspaper with keyboard commands on computer, but even a few years back, it was a different story,\" adds Joy Bhai, otherwise known as Mohammad Asimujjaman, our Deputy section in charge, Production.  \"Before the page layout skills had expanded to electronic media, we used to rely on a pair of steady hands using cutting and pasting tools and of course a good eye,\" laughs Joy Bhai. \"We used to utilise layout boards, where we would manually cut and paste the news printouts following the right alignment. When they would be proofread, the designers would have to again manually cut out sections and replace them with the corrected types,\" Joy Bhai says. He further explains the manual layout wizardry, which requires another thousand words for me far exceeding the allotted word count. I came back to my desk, head spinning, thinking of all the ups and downs that we have gone through in the last two decades. I look at the individual computers sitting on our desks, at the fancy professional cameras, the tiny memory cards, the giant computers where all our advanced graphics are being done. Seeing them, Enam Bhai's tales surely sounded like something that happened during once-upon-a-time-when-there-was-no-electricity-and-dinosaur-exited era.  Prehistoric, yeah sure!"

      "text": "Litchis have hit the markets in Dinajpur and the price is also within the reach of the lovers of this juicy fruit. According to local traders and orchard owners, this year litchis have flooded the district's lone wholesale market in Kalitola area of Dinajpur town earlier than they did last year. Litchis are being plucked early as the growers fear that the fruit would be attacked by pests amid the extreme heat and untimely rain. Traders at several other fruit markets echoed the fruit sellers in the wholesale market. While visiting the market in Dinajpur town yesterday, this correspondent saw many offloading litchis from vans in bulk for sale. The varieties of the fruit include Madraji, Bedana, Kathali and China-3. Trader Babul Hossain said 100 pieces of Madraji litchis were being sold for Tk 80 to 150. It was around Tk 200 last year. The price of 1,000 pieces of the other varieties ranged between Tk 6,000 to Tk 8,000. The traders hinted that the price might go up in the upcoming days. Litchi growers say Dinajpur was producing more and more litchis every year. According to officials of Department of Horticulture in Dinajpur, litchis are being grown on 4,733 hectares of land this year. It has been noticed that the areas where litchi trees are planted are widening every year, said Golam Mostafa, deputy director of Department of Agricultural Extension in Dinajpur. \"You can find litchis at many places of Bangladesh but those of Dinajpur are something different. They have an exceptional taste and shape,\" said Golam Mostafa, a fruit trader who went to the wholesale market from Chittagong. He already sent four trucks loaded with the mouth-watering fruit to the port city. Litchis are grown almost everywhere in Dinajpur. However, the litchis of Mashimpur in Dinajpur Sadar upazila and Madhabbati and Robipur in Biral upazila are extremely tasty, said Imrul Ahsan, a horticulture expert who works at the agricultural extension department. He also said the department trained 810 litchi farmers how to grow the fruit without using pesticides."

      "text": "First it was the largest Indian state of Rajasthan that ejected Jawaharlal Nehru from its school textbook in the first week of last May, and then the Haryana government scrapped a chapter from a Class V textbook, which profiled political personalities of India. In the last week of last month, Tripura allegedly eliminated Mahatma Gandhi from the Class IX history textbook, although it includes chapters on Adolf Hitler, Karl Marx, the Russian Revolution, the French Revolution, the birth of cricket, and many other subjects. A mood change is sweeping some parts of India, where the erstwhile stalwarts of its history are being dropped like hot potatoes. And that proves the futility of fame. Last March, the Oxford students marched against the statue of Cecil Rhodes, the 19th century businessman and politician in South Africa, because he symbolised racism and colonialism. Right after the US occupation of Iraq, frenzied crowds fiercely pulled down Saddam Hussein's statues like some house of shame. Granite figures of Muammar Gaddafi rolled on the Libyan streets before and after this one-time Big Daddy was captured and killed.  Larger-than-life statues of Vladimir Lenin were knocked down in former Soviet Union and allied countries after the fall of communism. A giant 62-foot tall statue of Lenin that stood over East Berlin was cut up into more than 100 pieces and buried in a sandpit by a city that wanted to forget its communist past. History is rife with examples when today's heroes became tomorrow's zeroes, consigned to oblivion. Those who are overly enthusiastic to find a place in history often forget that history isn't enthusiastic to keep them there. Nothing lasts forever, and history, if anything, is a register of that fluidity keeping record of the fluctuating fortunes of rulers, revolutionaries, and reformers. The irony of history is that it eventually changes those who change it. If we remember Socrates, Plato and Aristotle today, or if we still draw inspiration from Leo Tolstoy or William Shakespeare, some of the everlasting names that have survived the wash of time, it's because they, like flood-proof houses, stand above rising tides. Fame has its pecking order in terms of who is remembered how long. Some last for days, others for years. Fewer people last for decades, even fewer for centuries. But ultimately, everyone is destined to be erased. Those who are forgotten already tell others that they should be ready to be all but forgotten. Prophets are remembered longer than reformers, who are remembered longer than politicians. Inventors have more shelf life than businessmen, who these days share the limelight with movie stars and sports icons. American artist Andy Warhol was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art. He included the words: \"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes,\" in the programmme for a 1968 exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden. An older version of the same concept in English is the expression \"nine days' wonder\", which dates at least as far back as the Elizabethan era. Thus, the lust for fame goes back in time. But how far back does it go? There was a time when warriors were idolised, the conquest of land being the primal desire of mankind after hunting and gathering. Explorers came next, the heroes who discovered uncharted courses and unknown landmasses. Philosophers, reformers, and litterateurs, who influenced minds and imagination, rose to their glories during the Reformation and the Renaissance.  The stage in the late 19th and much of the 20th century was shared between nationalist leaders and inventors. From the second half of the 20th century until now, the scene has been dominated by businessmen and entertainers. Meanwhile, hunger for titillation of senses and instant gratification has replaced thirst for knowledge and depth of wisdom. Fame is now as instantaneous as the famous. It seems unlikely that in the future it will last as long as it did in the past. And instead of being abiding, the state of being widely recognised is going to become a seasonal phenomenon. Recognised one year, one will be forgotten in the next.   It's said that the world, except for family members, forget a person within the first twelve hours of his or her death. Fame defies that power of instant erasure because the more accomplished ones live longer in the hearts of their followers and admirers. In that sense, fame is like deodorant: Those who sweat more get to wear it longer.  Sun makes wind and wind makes wave. Ordinary lives are ripples that die as quickly as they form, turning into waves only if the wind blows long enough. All waves break when out of depth, so do famous lives. They eventually go out of context, out of mind, and finally, out of sight.    The writer is the Editor of weekly First News and an opinion writer for The Daily Star. Email: badrul151@yahoo.com. "

      "text": "With the morning Eid prayers in mind, most men will undoubtedly opt for the crisp, white panjabi. This timeless classic will always remain unquestionably trendy. Although, now most fashion houses have brought various twists to make these more attractive. Le Reve has an excellent collection of semi long white panjabis with embroidery or other embellishments in the front. These can be worn with regular white straight pajamas or churidars to maintain simplicity. Aarong is also offering ornate collections of white panjabis with embroidery on the chest and neckline. The embroidery work can be of different colours such as green, blue, indigo, or orange, to stand out against the base colour. Nabarupa, although primarily a sari house, also has a variety of delicately worked white classy panjabis.  If white panjabis are too simple for you, then you can always take it up a notch with cream or beige as base colours. Lubnan has brought gorgeous cream coloured silk panjabis with emboss print all over the piece. The embroidery work on the button plate and round the collar band is contrasted with the base colour. Younger generation could of course look to wear something slightly trendier during the morning hours. As such, digitally printed white panjabi can be the right choice for them.  It is a regular fit white panjabi with a splash of rainbow colours digitally printed on one side of the chest. It looks subtle for early hours but fashionable enough to stand out in a crowd.  After the congregational morning prayers, most men would like to change into something more colourful yet comfortable.  It is hot and sunny out there with unexpected rainfall every now and then. While silk may seem suitable for the festive occasion, the fabric may not leave enough room for your skin to breathe. Keeping that in mind, cotton would undoubtedly be your pick this monsoon. During the second part of the day, solid colours --preferably lighter ones such as blue, green and yellow-- can be worn. Yellow has also introduced its new collection for Eid, where the focus is on bold colours and delicate embroidery work on the chest, back and collar. Most young men opt for the colour blue, which is why intricate embroidery of zodiac blue design on a blue base can be their choice. A new style that caught my eye was the \"Chicago\" panjabi. It is cut and sown with contrast detailing and stands out mainly due to the unique design. Unlike most panjabis, the Chicago has both its front and the back panels' lower cuts done in a curved style instead of a usual straight line, with one with front pocket and buttoned sleeves. Aarong, Kay Kraft and Nabarupa also have a range of solid colour short panjabis with patchwork of contrast or patterned cloth.  If embroidery is not your style, you can decide on printed panjabis with bright colours, or my personal favourite - Kabulis, or shalwar suits for men. If you are looking for something both unique and trendy, then the kabuli's available at Yellow are a must. There is a wide variety of regular fit monochrome kabulis with front pockets and wide pajamas to combine with. You may also purchase the single kabuli and contrast it with white pajamas. If your intention is to dress simple, then stripes and checks are what you are looking for. Deshi dosh and Shotabdi also have a wide range of hand-embroidered panjabis to choose from.  At night, there are parties to attend or host which is when all men would like to dress their best. Lubnan has an extensive range of Panjabis with all over embroidery or elaborate embroidery work on the chest, collar and, hands, while keeping the rest of the Panjabi simple. Late hours call for darker colours such as maroon, purple, navy blue or black. There are different materials to choose from including heavy silk, silk, endi cotton, and khaadi or jute cotton. Panjabis with minimal designs are more than suitable to pull off a classy look. Nonetheless, you can always take it up a notch during festive seasons with intricate designs from Nabila or Vasavi.  The white shalwar is a timeless classic. However, shalwars narrowed around the ankle tend to look good with almost all types of panjabis, and churidars can be worn on special occasions. While panjabi is considered a traditional item, it can also be worn with chinos to create a modern fusion. Yet another comfortable but trendy option would be Indo-Western polo pants. It is baggy from the waist to knees, and narrows from there till the ankles. These can usually be worn with sherwanis or normal panjabis once you get used to the comfort it brings. To pull off a casual wear, you can always toss your Panjabi over a pair of jeans or gabardine pants.   However, if you find that all the fashion houses or boutiques could not bring something to your taste, you can always personalise. Tailoring places like Top Ten, Sunmoon, Ferdous and such are very good for getting a custom made panjabi for yourself and your near ones.  Most well-known brands have short panjabis starting from Tk 1000 to Tk 2500, and panjabis from Tk 1500 to Tk 12,000, due the variety of options available.  Gone are the days when women's fashion wear overshadowed the men's fashion scene. With the broad range of design and style available this season, let's wear panjabi in style.

      "text": "Image: Kazi Tahsin Agaz Apurbo Unlike a storm, a flood or a famine, an earthquake never signals or even hints at its arrival. It can happen at any time with an estimated 500,000 earthquakes shaking the Earth to its very foundations each year. Unfortunately for us, Dhaka happens to be one of the most risky zones of Bangladesh when it comes to this calamity. Beneath the hustle and bustle of our very own mega-polis, the plates have begun to shift, building up decades of tension, awaiting release. The impact of the foretold Earthquake is predicted to be worse than the bombing of Hiroshima. It is estimated that a 7.5 magnitude earthquake would kill about 130,000 people and level 72,000 buildings, according to a Bangladesh's government report. Given that Dhaka is a little far, nearly 5 to 500 km, from the Myanmar micro-plate, even if a 7 magnitude earthquake hits Assam, India , then Dhaka will teeter on the possibility of being ruined, according to a seismologist. Approximately 20 tremors happened last year and among them 18 hit magnitudes of over four. Experts fear they may just have been warnings for Dhaka. The most destructive quake in recorded history was the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake in China where more than 830,000 people died. Moreover, the 7.5 earthquake near Beijing in 1976 killed 240,000 but the magnitude of 7.0 in Haiti in 2010 led to the loss of lives of 316,000. Then there was the strong earthquake of 8.6 magnitudes which occurred in Assam on August 15 in 1950, killing 1,526 people preceded by another 8.1 magnitude quake which hit Assam on June 12 in 1897 killing 1,500 people. The comparatively lower level of casualties was because of the low density of the population and the few concrete structures present at the time. Given this context, we can observe from the estimate above, that Bangladesh is in grave danger. Dhaka is a megacity boasting one of the highest population densities in the world. This city lies in the moderate risk zone due to some other factors such as the high population density, unplanned urbanisation, and lack of open spaces making the capital all the more vulnerable. Because of this, most of the people in this city perceive that Dhaka is sitting on a rapidly ticking time-bomb. To put things further into context, an understanding of the strength of the possible earthquake needs to be developed. In August of 1945, The United States of America cast down a ruinous atomic bomb on Nagasaki in Japan. The result was a loss of 40,000 lives. The power of 'Fatman', as the bomb was known, was 20,000 TNT (Tri Nitro Toluene). If 5 thousand such bombs were to blow up together, it will be equivalent of ten core ton TNT. It now seems that thousands of atomic bombs lie beneath this city. It has now become a natural curse for us. We are largely afraid that, if more powerful tremors begin to hit our city, then it must lose its habitability overtime. We have a brutal history of collapsing buildings owing to lax building codes. This does not bode well for us. Our response teams are also ill-equipped, as demonstrated by the fall of Rana Plaza and the 21 day rescue effort it took. Now we are worried that if Dhaka is flattened by a terrible quake then how much time will be taken to defend or even conduct the rescue operations. This is the time for us to make important decisions and formulate policies keeping such disasters in mind. There are thousands of powerful ticking time bombs underneath our beautiful city. We can no longer close our eyes and ears and continue to ignore this matter.  The writer is a student of University of Dhaka, and a policy maker at Social awareness forum of Bangladesh (SAF)."

But at the same time, HSC examination is going on in the country. Considering the sufferings of the HSC applicants, we have withdrawn the strike for passenger vessels plying the Dhaka-Barisal route,\" he said. The strike will remain in force for other vessels until the demands of the water transport workers are met, he added. Operation of vessels has been suspended across the country since the early hours of Thursday. The government has meanwhile convened a tripartite meeting today with the representatives of vessel owners and workers to end the deadlock. The BWTWF called the strike to press home its 15-point demands, including a minimum monthly wage of Tk 10,000 for workers and increase in overtime pay, festival bonuses and other benefits. During a visit to the capital's Sadarghat terminal yesterday, it was seen that many passengers were waiting for vessels to reach their respective destinations. Sathi Akhter told The Daily Star at noon yesterday, \"I have been waiting since morning to go to Chandpur. It is uncertain when we can go home.\" Passengers were left in a confused state as no-one could ensure them about launches, which will leave the terminal. Low-income group people suffered the most as they could not afford alternative vehicles. Many were seen lying on the floor of the terminal.   Md Faruk, a mason, said, \"I will go to my village home in Barguna. It will cost me Tk 400. If I take alternative transport, it will take at least Tk 1,000. I cannot spend that much.\" However, a number of passenger launches defied the strike and left Dhaka yesterday. Seventeen launches left the terminal for different destinations as of 9:00pm, said Mohammad Shahidullah, port officer of Sadarghat. A launch named Moyur-1 of Dhaka-Barisal was seen leaving the terminal around 1:30pm. Abdus Salam, supervisor of the launch, said, \"Our workers get adequate salary. So they are not in strike.\" Golam Kibria Tipu, a launch owner, claimed workers of goods-carrying vessels are mainly observing the strike. MEETING The government has convened a meeting with vessel owners and workers at the Department of Labour at 4:30pm today. Officials of the ministries of shipping, and labour and employment and representatives of vessel owners and workers are likely to attend the meeting. Chowdhury Ashiqul Alam, general secretary of the BWTWF, said, \"We will not lift the strike until our demands are met.\" Mahbub Uddin Ahmed Bir Bikram, chairman of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport (passenger carriers) Association, said, \"We hope to reach a solution through negotiations tomorrow [today].\" Passengers, patients, workers and businesspeople are the worst victims of the strike, reports our Jhalokathi correspondent. \"I could not buy food for my family as I had no work at the terminal,\" said Nur Alam, a load and unload worker of Jhalokathi Launch Ghat. \"The salt industries in Jhalokathi have thousands of workers, who will be jobless if the strike continues two or three days more. The industries are fully dependent on water communications,\" said Mahabub Hossen, president of Jhalokathi Chamber of Commerce and Industries. Engine boats and trawlers carrying passengers were charging additional fares in the southern region taking advantage of the launch strike, reports our Barisal correspondent. Buses were also overcrowded and tickets were not available for long route destinations."

He turns 68 today, but is celebrating only his 17th birthday, as his birthday falls on February 29, and comes only on leap years. The Daily Star interviewed the towering figure of media world on his big day. Excerpts: People celebrate their birthday every year, but your turn comes once every four years. What are your birthday plans this time? Mamunur Rashid: I have some ideas. People don't need to bother about my birthday as it comes  every four years. Counting birthdays, I will be 17 this year (laughs). But actually I'm 68 today. What brings meaning to your life? Mamunur Rashid: Life means work and feeling. Am I seeing nature around me? Am I feeling everything around me? If I can, I'm living my life. Is my life of 68 years really meaningful for me? Every day I encounter questions, like can I really do something for people in my long journey? Every day I ask myself these questions. Sometimes I think wish I could give something more. Do you have any regrets when you look back at your 68 years? Mamunur Rashid: A lot, especially the mistakes I made in my early days. My life span doesn't; what's important is my work. Shakespeare lived for only 52 years, yet we are still millions of miles behind what he achieved in that short span. Why did you choose acting as a profession? Mamunur Rashid: I grew up watching theatre at my village home. In my childhood, the stage play \"Sohrab Rostom\" was a great inspiration. A stage play can make people happy and sad. On the whole, destiny paved my way for the life of arts and entertainment. Do memories of your youth flood back sometimes? Mamunur Rashid: Often. We used to hang out at Sharif Mia's canteen at Dhaka University. We often stayed there late into the night. Poets Nirmalendu Goon and the late Abul Hossain are my friends from that time. Many young artistes attribute their success to you. How does it make you feel? Mamunur Rashid: It's a great achievement for any artiste. A number of artistes came to the spotlight through Aranyak Nattaya Dal. Many have become dramatists, directors and designers, besides actors. Any fields that you want still want to foray into? Mamunur Rashid: I want to make a film, although I don't know when it will come about. Acting is now my profession. For my livelihood I'm still seen on camera. Besides, I'm active on  stage. What do you consider your biggest achievement? Mamunur Rashid: People's love and adulation. Any favourite song?  Mamunur Rashid: One Rabindra Sangeet titled \"Labonney Purno Pran\" and another Nazrul Sangeet-- \"Bhuli Kemone Ajo Je Mone\"."

      "text": "Jute plants on vast tracts of land are drying up due to unceasing drought that has been prevailing in Fulchhari upazila of the district for the last one and a half months. Although farmers irrigate the land with water raised from underground by pumps, the situation remains unchanged. The scorching sun is drying out the tender jute plants, and jute seeds cannot germinate due to the dryness of the land. Farmers made good profit from jute cultivation in the last two years, so many of them took it up, but the drought this season might seriously reduce production, said local farmers. This year, rivers and other sources of water went dry much earlier, which badly affected crop production, said Saidur Rahman, a farmer of Golna village in the upazila. Farmers of the upazila prefer cultivating early variety of jute to avoid damage by flood, as the area is flood prone and they cannot harvest jute plants after the fields get submerged by flood water, said Abul Kashem, another farmer. Although the agriculture department assured better production of late sowing jute seeds after harvesting boro crop, flood water often submerges vast tracts of land in Fulchhari much earlier, he added. According to the upazila agriculture office, 4,000 hectares of land will be brought under jute cultivation this season. Meanwhile, farmers sowed seeds on about 3,000 hectares. While visiting some drought hit areas of Kanchipara, Uriya and Gajaria villages, this correspondent saw that farmers were irrigating dried up jute fields with deep tubewells, but the jute plants still could not survive. The tender jute plants are gradually dying in the scorching sun, said Akbar Ali, a jute grower of Kanchipara. \"We are worried about the production of jute this season, because drought will hinder normal growth of jute stalk,\" he added. \"This season, we had to sow seeds twice or thrice, as the seeds failed to germinate due to acute drought, forcing us to incur additional expenditure,\" said Altaf Hossain, a jute farmer of Uriya. \"At present, we have nothing to do against natural calamities, especially the changing trend of climate. However farmers still have time to sow jute seeds soon after rain,\" said Tahajul Islam, upazila agriculture officer."

The woman fell headlong, banging her head at the edge of a pot hole. Blood oozed out as she moaned in pain. People screamed, abusing the car driver and a fist fight ensued. Welcome to the city of Dhaka, the world's worst city to live in after war-torn Damascus.   Bangladesh's capital has a core area of 325 sq km with a density of over 45,000 people per sq km. The larger metropolitan area comprises around 2,161,17 sq km. Unplanned construction, land grabbing, waste dumping, waterlogging, traffic congestion, air and noise pollution and fast rising population has led to a crisis situation. In 2004, road and infrastructure damage cost around Tk. 7 to 8 billion annually.   Road comprises only 7 percent of the city instead of the 16 percent minimally required. In Paris and Chicago, the proportion is 25 percent and 40 percent, respectively (Michael Hollen).   Dhaka lacks planned network with adequate feeder roads to main roads and highways. With 650 major intersections and 60 main traffic lights, some often broken, it can take over an hour to cover 1 km. Traffic congestion delays are estimated to cost US$ 3.8 billion annually. Inadequate transportation to the suburbs leaves no option but to crowd into the city, cooped up in high rises or slums.   A 2009 World Bank survey found 60 separate bus companies, each with their own routes and schedules.  Links to political parties or powerful trade unions make it almost impossible to regularise them. Annually, over 37,000 additional vehicles ply the roads. A World Bank report found that 50 percent of the bus drivers and less than half of the CNG drivers have proper driving license. Moreover, the footpaths are occupied by temporary shops, forcing pedestrians to walk on crammed roads leading to accidents.         Dhaka's population increase by rural migration is 4.4 percent annually, the highest in the world. This has created unprecedented challenges for weak city authorities. Illegal infrastructure and blocked water courses abound. Residential areas are used for non-residential purposes, and high rise buildings, too closely built, are results of uncontrolled market forces. 62 percent of residential/commercial areas have 25 percent planned and 37 percent unplanned infrastructure. Estate developers and powerful mastans have destroyed 80 percent of the capital's open spaces; water retention ponds and wetlands flood flow areas. The water table has gone down below 300 feet due to overuse. This can lead to subsidence.     In 1987, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) identified three major khal systems in greater Dhaka: a) Degun-Ibrahimpur-Kalyanpur khal system draining into the Buriganga and the Turag river; b) Gulshan-Banani-Begunbari-Dhanmondi khal system, draining into the Balu river and; c) Dholai-Girani-Segunbagicha khal system draining into Buriganga and Balu rivers. But in the last 25 years, unplanned filling up of water bodies and illegal construction work have caused many khals to disappear and have clogged up existing ones. They were storm sewers; water retention areas; surface water bodies to check flood flows and allow water to percolate into the ground.  The Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) estimated that in September 2010, waterlogging caused a loss of Tk. 632 billion for the garment industry and flooding, leading to a loss of Tk. 12.8 billion (Khan 2010). Out of the 43 canals, 17 have completely disappeared and 26 are in critical condition.    Stagnant water breeds water-borne diseases like typhoid, diarrhoea, dengue and hepatitis. Millions are victims every year.  From 2010 to 2013, land developers almost destroyed the main section of the Turag River by constructing on over 87 acres of the river bank. In the flood flow zone along Balu River, illegal encroachment turned 548 acres into housing plots in just four years. JICA estimates that approximately 683 acres of Mohammadpur water retention zones have been filled up. Vast river beds surrounding the capital have been illegally acquired, thereby destroying the drainage system and access to safe drinking water. Currently, the rivers Buriganga, Sitalakhya, Turag and Balu receive 2 million cubic metres of waste water every day from over 7,000 industrial units. The Buriganga, containing a high level of cadmium, chromium, mercury and solid waste is considered a dead river.             Pollution of all kinds is rampant: lead in dust and paint, pollution from leather and textile dyeing, industrial emissions, suspended particulates and excessive carbon monoxide from vehicles. Suspended dust from construction and factories are major sources of sulphur-dioxide, lead, mercury, manganese and other organic compounds. Ground level ozone and nitrogen oxide add to health hazards. .  Dry season air concentration of lead is 463 monograms, higher even than the 383 monograms in Mumbai, and causes respiratory diseases like asthma, apart from high blood pressure, heart diseases and even cancer.    The World Health Organisation (WHO) ranks Dhaka as the fourth worst city in the world for air quality. An estimated 15,000 premature deaths as well as around 5 million pulmonary, respiratory and neurological illnesses were attributed to poor air quality as early as 1999 (UNEP).  Dearth of open spaces and playgrounds impacts negatively on the quality of life and social ecology. The feeling of community disappears as new people and offices occupy high rise buildings in areas where everyone had their own homes and lived in social harmony. This loss of community bonds brings in the risk of insecurity, crimes, theft, fear and violence.   By 2031, World Bank estimates that the population of Dhaka could exceed 25 million, while that of greater Dhaka could surpass 40 million. This has to be managed as has been done in Tokyo and Seoul. The government has taken up some projects for sustainable water and transport, but sporadic activities will not be enough.      Saving Dhaka will be hard. It poses difficult and expensive political choices and requires years of political commitment and good governance. It will also disrupt the lives of millions, and so citizens' participation must be vigorously canvassed to achieve a better quality of life for all.      Funding from multiple donors and IFIs has to be deployed with transparency and monitoring by external agencies. The government will need experts from abroad and home. One large donor or several donors may take up specific sectors, formulating plans in collaboration with other sectors to avoid replication and wastage. Dhaka needs to be decentralised, firstly by constructing efficient transportation such as metro-rails, over-bridges and roads for quick connectivity with the city. Affordable townships for middle, lower middle and lower classes must be built outside greater Dhaka to house those currently living on illegal land and buildings, and for rural newcomers. At least 60 percent of the unplanned constructions and buildings on wetlands, river banks and other open spaces have to be demolished, irrespective of partisanship or powerful political lobby.  In addition, rivers and lakes must be cleared and restored. Polluting industries must upgrade their technology and move outside greater Dhaka or to other divisions, thereby enabling other areas to develop. New and existing commercial centres must be helped to grow outside the city and compete to reduce population pressure on Dhaka, for instance by relocating RMG factories, SMEs, private universities and essential government and medical services to other districts.  The situation is already desperate. Only when the government and all parties are totally committed to engage in expert planning and strong action will Dhaka have some chance of a sustainable future.

      "text": "A nine-kilometre river embankment and three under-construction water regulators would save thousands of inhabitants of the coastal town of Mongla from recurrent tidal surge by the end of this year, said the local mayor and officials concerned. The embankment along with a marine drive and the sluice gates on three canals flowing through Mongla town would end the long-standing problem of inundation as well as giving an immense boost to the local economy, said Zulfikar Ali, Mongla municipality mayor. The construction works are being carried out under a $201 million City Region Development Project (CRDP) initiated by the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) and jointly funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Swedish Sida, and German KFW. \"The embankment, which is built 3.6 metres above sea level as flood barrier and water regulator sluice gates with improved storm drainage facilities under the CRDP, would resolve a three-decade old inundation problem in Mongla municipality,\" said the mayor. The coastal town would experience inundation during high tide in the months of June, July and August, he said. A marine drive along the embankment would help around 60,000 labourers of adjoining and remote villages with a direct access to the sea port, special economic zone, export processing zone and various industries, said Zulfikar. Besides, tourists coming to the port town as well as locals would have fascinating recreational facilities with walkways and benches all along the river bank, the mayor said, adding that the area would come under enhanced security coverage. Along the embankment, a 10-km internal road was being improved with climate-resilient, reinforced concrete casting, said Hamidul Hoque, LGED executive engineer and deputy director of the project. Trees would be planted on both sides of the 24-foot wide marine drive, he said. The existing storm drainage system along the 10-km road was being improved so as to utilise it as outfalls for discharging waste and storm water of the municipal area into the canals. Besides, dredging of 28km canals crisscrossing Khulna city and repair of flood control structures along the city were going on under the CRDP scheme, which would benefit around five lakh people in Khulna city, said Project Director Ahsan Habib. A 2.25-km embankment with concrete casting driveway along the Bhairab river in Khulna city is also being developed under the scheme. This would protect the city from flooding. Also, trees would be planted along the embankment. \"Climate resilient cement uniblock concrete has been used instead of traditional bricks to build the embankment driveway, leaving enough space for planting trees,\" the PD said, adding that recreational facilities along these embankments were also integral parts of the scheme. Concrete casting and cement casting concrete blocks are more durable and climate resilient, said Ahsan. Bituminous road is vulnerable to rainwater and inundation. Besides, it causes enormous carbon emission when bricks and bitumen, which is an expensive imported material, are burned, he added. Three-fourths of the work of the Mongla component has been done so far, said Ahsan. Of the total project cost, Tk 76 crore would be required for the Mongla project. The ADB provided $120 million as soft loan for the implementation of the CRDP project. Oleg Tonkonojenkov, deputy country director of ADB, said they would promote climate resilient and green development design as an overarching theme. The CRDP project, which started in 2011 and is scheduled to be complete by 2016, aims at climate resilient waste management, drainage, water supply and sanitation, promoting solar energy and urban transport, urban planning and municipal management. The project area encompasses four city corporations in Dhaka region and one in Khulna region, 12 municipalities -- seven in Dhaka and five in Khulna -- and 36 urban centres at upazila levels. Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) is currently preparing a 20-year master plan for the capital city under the project."

      "text": "With recession of floodwater, diarrhoea and other waterborne diseases have been spreading sporadically among the flood-affected people, intensifying the sufferings of the flood victims. The situation at different parts of the country has turned to worse as there is an acute shortage of pure drinking water in addition to improper sanitation. The victims are mainly suffering from diseases like diarrhoea, dysentery, fever, eczema, itches and other waterborne diseases. Amid the situation, many flood-affected people are allegedly being cheated by the health department in some areas including Manikganj as the water purification tablets being distributed among them were found to be ineffective. The flood victims have been given water purification tablets Halazone, which has not worked, they alleged. The people fell sick after drinking contaminated water as the tablets which they used to purify it failed, they complained. The tablets were manufactured by Hind Pharma in Bhopal Industrial Area in India in September 2014 and the expiry date is August 2016. Civil surgeon of Manikganj Dr Emran Ali said the tablets became ineffective due to improper preservation. \"I have asked my team members to retrieve the distributed tablets. I have also asked them to stop distributing those tablets anymore,\" he added. Deputy Commissioner of Manikganj Rashida Ferdouse said she was informed about the tablets. She also directed the upazila nirbahi officers to retrieve the distributed tablets from the flood-affected people through the chairmen of the union parishads. Around three lakh people of 43 unions of Farirampur, Daulatpur, Shivalaya, Ghior, Saturia and Sadar upazila of the district are under threat of health hazards as the floodwater is receding. As the floodwater is receding, different waterborne diseases like diarrhoea and other intestine diseases are spreading fast among the flood-affected people of Teesta shoals, reports our Nilphamari correspondent. The flood victims there have taken shelter on different structures of the Water Development Board (WDB) in Dalia of the district. Acute shortage of pure drinking water in addition to lack of sanitation arrangement is responsible, said Rabiul Islam Shahin, chairman of Tepa Kharibari Union Parishad. The same situation is prevailing in Lalmonirhat, Gaibandha, Jamalpur and Chandpur. As there is lack of awareness among the flood victims, they are drinking floodwater-mixed water and are being affected by different waterborne diseases , our correspondent in Lalmonirhat reports. Jahedul Islam, 48, a flood victim at Ananda Bazar village in Lalmonirhat Sadar upazila, said his widow mother Jahera Bewa, 72, has been suffering from diarrhoea after taking floodwater-mixed water. She has been admitted to Lalmonirhat Sadar Hospital. \"Our two children have also been affected and are under treatment at home,\" he added. Pure drinking water is not available in the flood-affected areas, as all the tube-wells went under water at Khatiyamari Char village in Fulchhari upazila, our Gaibandha correspondent writes. Marjina Begum, a housewife in the area, said they have taken shelter on the Singria embankment. Flood victims, cattle and poultry are living side by side on the embankment, resulting in pollution in the living environment. \"I have been suffering from dysentery for last three days, but it has been difficult to arrange preventive medicine,\" said Ramjan Ali, a flood victim on the embankment. Many of the children have been affected by intestinal diseases. Health workers often supply water-purifying tablets and oral saline, but those are not adequate at all, said Abdul Quddus, another flood victim. Erosion continues in some points of the Padma river due to strong current, our Munshiganj correspondent reports. Around 150-foot road was eroded due to strong current of the Arial Kha river at Dorga Bazar under Bhaga upazila in the district last Thursday, our Faridpur correspondent reports. The locals worked the whole night to prevent the erosion with the help of WDB. Md Safikul Islam, a schoolteacher, said the collapse started around 1:30pm, adding, when the strong current with wind hit the road, it eroded the stretch of the road around 4:00pm. Sultan Mahamud, executive engineer of the WDB of Faridpur, said, \"We have continued our work to prevent the erosion. As the locals helped us prevent the collapse and save the road, we have succeeded to avert a big problem.\" He added they have already dropped 15,000 sand sacks and 2,000 bags full of bricks to protect the road."

Many previously unemployed people, often from disadvantaged families, have taken up the activity as a means of self-employment and a path to a better future. \"A decade ago the basic needs of our family could not be met on my father's farming income alone,\" says Nasir Uddin from Chandpur village in Sylhet's Fenchuganj upazila. \"I wanted to do something to help our family.\" In 2005, after completing a short training course on the subject in Derai upazila of Sunamganj district, Nasir set up a duck farm adjacent to his home. With the added income from the ducks, his dream to help support his family has come true. Not only Nasir, but around 200 others in the area have established household duck farms, some with NGO loans for start-up capital. \"After achieving bumper profits thanks to good prices last year,\" says Monur Miah, 29, of the same village, \"I'm expanding my duck farm.\" \"I can earn over Tk 3 lakhs annually from ducks,\" says neighbour Quasem Ali. \"I started my duck farm two years ago,\" says Anwar Miah, 28, of Ferighat village in Fenchuganj. \"I used to be unemployed; but then I was helping out at Monir Miah's duck farm and I learnt how to do it.\" He started with 100 ducklings purchased by loan. Each duckling, just a few days old he bought for about Tk. 50, selling all after 4 months for up to Tk. 150 each. That was two years ago. \"Recently I bought 8,000 ducklings,\" he says. \"Nowadays I am solvent.\" Similarly another neighbour, Muhon Miah, 32, says he bought 5,000 ducklings a few days ago for about Tk. 70 each. He expects to sell them after 4 months at a rate of up to Tk. 200 each. Professor Dr. Md. Mohan Mia of the Department of Veterinary Animal Science at Sylhet Agriculture University told the Daily Star that around the world duck farming has a long tradition, with present domestic breeds derived originally from wild birds. \"As those wild duck species wandered, some were domesticated due to their value as a food source.\" He says that in Sylhet these days, poor housewives and unemployed villagers are often attracted to ducks farming by the relatively low establishment costs, recognising the income potential of selling both meat and eggs. Divisional deputy director of the livestock department Dr. Achintya Kumar Saha, says duck farming projects often prove to be profitable and sustainable. He estimates there are around 1,800 duck farms in haor areas of Sylhet Division."

      "text": "Construction of the 850-metre-long Second Teesta Bridge over the river in Kaliganj of Lalmonirhat is yet to be completed even though a deadline for its completion expired in June last year. Although a new deadline for the construction of the bridge has been set for December this year, uncertainty looms over its completion by that time, as the construction work of the bridge is going on at a snail's pace, locals said. The unsatisfactory progress has frustrated thousands of people living in Lalmonirhat, Rangpur, and adjoining districts. The bridge, once in operation, would connect Kaliganj upazila in Lalmonirhat with Gangachara upazila in Rangpur. Navana Group-WMCG jointly got the work order for the construction of the bridge. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina laid the foundation stone on October 19, 2011. Sources in the Local Government Engineering Department said a total of 85 girders and 17 slabs for the bridge would be constructed. Of them, only 26 girders and four slabs have been built so far. The cost for the construction of the bridge was estimated at Tk 121 crore, they added. Regarding the slow pace of the ongoing work, project manager Sadhan Kumar Saha said, \"The construction work of the bridge is going on slowly as the prices of materials increased over time.\" Sadhan also claimed that a rise in the prices of construction materials was one of the main reasons why the company missed the first deadline for the completion of the bridge. He asked this correspondent to contact LGED officials for further details. Parvez Newaj Khan, engineer of Kaliganj upazila LGED, said, \"The construction work was hampered during the countrywide strikes and blockades in early 2015 and that the firm could not bring machines and materials to the project site on time. He, however, said the construction was going on smoothly now and that there was no fund crisis. The construction of the bridge would be completed within the new deadline, he added. On December 17 last year, a girder of the bridge collapsed at the construction site. An engineer of the construction firm and two labourers were injured in the incident. Another girder of the bridge collapsed on November 15, but no one was injured in that incident. Locals alleged that low quality materials were used for the construction of the girders. Manjur Islam, 50, of Mahipur Ghat area, alleged that the construction firm had used local sand and stones for making the girders, but LGED officials never protested against this. Wishing anonymity, an engineer of Lalmonirhat LGED also echoed the locals. After the girder collapse, LGED officials gave orders to destroy three other girders that were built along with the one that collapsed in December. Neither the firm nor the LGED officials could specifically say why the three girders were being destroyed. However, the executive engineer of Lalmonirhat LGED and the construction firm officials claimed that the girder, weighing about 157 tonnes, slipped from the gantry crane while it was being placed on the bridge's pillars. Refuting the allegation of using low quality materials, they said the incident happened due to technical issues, and that it was just an accident. The project manager too refuted the allegation of using low quality materials and said the girder collapsed as it slipped from the crane. Contacted, Executive Engineer of Lalmonirhat LGED Al-Amin Khan said the project site is big, \"so accidents might happen\". He claimed that there was no scope for using low quality sand or stone, as the quality of the materials was tested before using them in construction work. The firm would construct new girders and place those on the bridge, he said, adding that the whole process would be overseen by LGED engineers. Al-Amin claimed that LGED officials always monitor the progress of the work to make sure that materials specified in the tender schedule are being used. He expressed hope that the bridge would be completed by December this year, and it would be opened to public next year. Several lakh people of Aditmari, Kaliganj, Hatibandha and Patgram in Lalmonirhat use the route which connects them with Rangpur city and other parts of the country. Once the bridge is complete, it would ease communication, contribute to the development of the area, and help bring economic and social benefits for the people of this region."

The flood-affected people are compelled to take shelter on higher ground or flood control embankments with their belongings, including cattle. Robbers attack the flood victims and loot their valuables. At least six robberies had happened in different places of Kapasia, Sreepur and Haripur unions before the watchtowers were set up.  The criminals were committing the crime even in broad daylight, said locals of Kapasia union. Considering the plight of the char people, Gaibandha-1 lawmaker Monjurul Islam Liton has financially helped the locals set up the watchtowers, each of which is 30-feet high, in the char areas of Kapasia and Haripur unions. With their physical labour, locals have set up the towers. At least 10 people can stay on a tower at a time for observing movement of robbers' boats. They blow whistles to alert people if they see any such boat coming. \"We do our duties round the clock by rotation. At night, we run searchlights by using solar panels,\" said Mokbul Hossain, one of them who guards against robbery. After setting up of the watchtowers, no robbery occurred here, said Somesh Ali of Haripur river ghat. Locals said those towers somewhat relieved their anxiety over robbery. Lawmaker Monjurul Islam gave the money from the Test Relief (TR) programme for setting up the two towers, said Nurunnabi Sarker, project implementation officer of Sundarganj upazila. Construction of a permanent watchtower is costly. If a permanent watchtower is built, it will help reduce the incident of robbery in the char areas, said Mozharul Islam, chairman of Haripur union."

      "text": "The Supreme Court yesterday upheld a 2011 High Court verdict that ordered demolition of the 15-storey BGMEA building illegally built in the heart of Begunbari canal in the capital.  The HC in April 2011 ordered the authorities to demolish the building in the Begunbari-Hatirjheel canal within three months, saying it was built on a land acquired through forgery and earth-filled the water body illegally. Later, the SC stayed the HC order following a petition filed by the BGMEA. BGMEA President Siddiqur Rahman told The Daily Star that they would file a review petition with the SC.   However, Manzill Murshid, an SC lawyer who was present in the court during yesterday's hearing, told this correspondent that now, there is no need for full text of the SC order for knocking down the building, as the authorities concerned had earlier received the full verdict of the HC which is now in effect.    A four-member bench of the Appellate Division headed by Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha passed the order after dismissing a leave to appeal petition filed by Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the apex body of apparel industry. The BGMEA building has been in the way of the storm drainage system -- one of the Hatirjheel integrated scheme's prime objectives -- to drain stormwater out of Paribagh, Karwan Bazar and Eskaton, according to the relevant technical experts.   The Begunbari canal stretching from Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue to Rampura and beyond is a vital drainage system to help mitigate urban flooding in the capital, said Professor Mujibur Rahman, who led the technical expert team of the scheme.  Dhaka's master plan earmarks the Begunbari canal as a natural water body and a designated flood flow zone, prohibiting any change to its character. The much-hyped Hatirjheel-Begunbari integrated development scheme was opened in January 2013 with the illegal building standing boldly right in the middle of the Begunbari canal. Terming the SC order a historic decision, lawyer Manzill, who was as an amicus curiae (friend of court) in the hearing of the case at the HC, said the people's confidence in rule of law will be enhanced following the SC order, as they will now feel that nobody is above the law. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, told this correspondent that the SC order will help speed up the water body protection movement from land grabbers. The apex court order is a big milestone against the culture of impunity in the society, she added. The HC in 2011 said the records submitted by the office of deputy commissioner of Dhaka proved that the land was acquired for the then East Bengal Railway in 1910 and it was in the possession of the Bangladesh Railway until 2006. The railway authorities handed over the land to the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) in 2006. Surprisingly, it was found in the documents submitted by the BGMEA that it purchased the land from the EPB in 2001. The HC delivered the judgment after hearing a suo moto rule issued by another HC bench taking cognizance of a newspaper report in October 2010.  The full text of the HC judgment, released in March 2013, observed that the BGMEA building stood in Hatirjheel project \"like a cancerous growth\" and structures like these would swamp the whole city unless the building was removed forthwith. The court also ordered the authorities to pull the building down and use the land in the public interest and directed the BGMEA to provide refunds to the people who bought floor spaces in the building. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during her first tenure laid the foundation stone of the BGMEA building in November 1998, while former premier Khaleda Zia inaugurated the building in October 2006. Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) issued land use clearance while the Department of Environment issued environmental clearance and Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Wasa) clearance for the building in the canal. Civil Aviation Authorities also issued the height clearance. Besides those clearances, the BGMEA authorities needed to obtain building approval from Rajuk, which they did not. Rajuk only served one notice on the BGMEA authorities about this in more than a decade of the building's existence. Various environmental and civic groups time and again demanded that the government take steps to knock the illegal BGMEA building down. BGMEA's lawyer barrister Rafique-ul Huq said, \"I personally feel that demolition of the BGMEA building will have a very bad effect on the garment sector and the economy of the country, as the economy depends on the garment industry.\" The Supreme Court said the water body, where the BGMEA building was constructed, was filled up in violation of the wetlands conservation act. During yesterday's hearing, it also asked Attorney General Mahbubey Alam how the Rajuk let the BGMEA fill up the water body. The attorney general said he did not know about it and he had no argument in this regard."

      "text": "Bangladesh is considered to be extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. In an attempt to provide safety and security for people living in low-lying coastal regions (15 percent of the country has an elevation below 1 m) against cyclones, tidal surges and flooding, the government has taken various measures over the last few decades, which included building 139 polders. Despite having polders, Bangladesh is facing adverse hydro-meteorological shocks, including inundation of coastal plains due to the high rate of sea-level rise (8 to 23 mm/year) as compared to the global trends (3.4 mm/year), salinity ingress, water-logging, reduction in cropland and crop yield, siltation of riverbeds, and impact on human health.   Despite an increase in natural calamities, the economic growth over the last few decades has been quite satisfactory with a GDP growth rate ranging between 4.8 percent to over 6 percent. The per capita GDP has grown from $631 in 1990 to $1,276 in 2010. In the face of population growth and climate change, it will be challenging to sustain the economic growth and to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in coming decades.   In this backdrop, it is imperative to formulate a long term strategic plan to protect the delta and its environment. Proper land and water management is central to the country's sustained economic development and protection of its environment. Recently, a large consortium, led by the consultancy firm Twynstra Gudde, has signed a contract for the development of the Delta Plan for Bangladesh 2100 (BDP2100), which is designed to formulate a long-term (50 to 100 years) delta governance. As per the Inception Report for the BDP2100, \"the mission is to develop strategies which contribute to disaster risk reduction, water safety, climate change resilience and adaptation, food security, and economic development of the country.\" This author holds the view that BDP2100 lacks merit on the following grounds: Ownership:According to news reports and the official webpage of BDP2100 (http://www.bangladeshdeltaplan2100.org), a total of eight (Twynstra, Mott McDonald, Climate Adaptation Services, Ecorys, Defacto, Deltares, Alterra, and Weeteveen BOS) out of ten consultency firms are from outside Bangladesh. This plan will put the management of land, water, and environment of the country in the hand of foreign agencies. Recently, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina reiterated that Bangladesh has achieved self-sufficiency in all sectors of development and there was no need to rely on foreign consultants for development projects. The inception of the BDP2100 is incongruent with the stated vision for development by the prime minister.   Accountability:According to the Dutch Water Sector, collaboration between the Netherlands and Bangladesh on various flood prevention measures and coastal zone management has been in place for over 50 years. The success from these projects in terms of flood prevention and coastal zone management has been scanty at most. What guarantee will the NGOs involved in the implementation of BDP2100 provide should the plan drive the delta to a path of failure and further destruction? Tranperancy:The BDP2100 is probably by far the largest land and water management project that Bangladesh has ever undertaken. It is expected that such a monumental project will be discussed in the Parliament and in open public forums. Yet, not much is known about the details of the project in the public domain.   Adoption of the failed structural approach:Building of flood control structures and polders did not prove to be an effective measure over the last six decades. The BDP2100 webpage states that \"besides these typical coastal projects, a number of river improvement projects are also of relevance for our baseline, such as the Gorai River Restoration Plan, the Ganges Barrage Plan, Bhairab River Plan and Kobadak River Basin Plan.\"  Without any water sharing agreement with upper riparian countries, there will be no guarantee of river flow needed to make the Gorai River Restoration Plan and the Ganges Barrage Plan a success during the lean season.   Absence of transboundary river issues: The BDP2100 mentions the adverse impacts of the Farakka Barrage and other upstream diversion structures, including the Indian River Linking Project, but it falls short in addressing the importance of an integrated water resources management plan for the GBM basins, involving all co-riparian countries. BDP2100 does not indicate how, or if, various projects can be successful without having any guarantee of adequate flow in transboundary rivers during lean seasons. Unidirectional composition of the technical team: The BDP2100 team consists of 39 people, of which eight belong to various Bangladeshi agencies and 21 belong to foreign consulting firms. Of the 21 consultants, eight are of Bangladeshi origin, but are employed by Euroconsult Mott McDonald. A vast majority of the team members are civil engineers, but the proposed BDP2100 involves dealing with subject matters pertaining to earth systems science, hydrogeology, coastal geomorphology, wetland ecosystems, sustainability science, agriculture, fisheries, and socio-cultural issues.   Open-ended nature of the project: Almost all the coastal structures are designed to face coastal hazards of a certain magnitude. A rise of sea level by 0.88 meters is likely to topple the existing polders. The proponents suggest a rise of polder height by one metre. However, a study by Gardiner (2014) projected a four metre rise in sea level in the next few decades, which will inundate about 40 percent of the land area in Bangladesh, including the polders, and will displace 50 million people. Under these uncertain predictions, BDP2100 will become obsolete and an open-ended project in the next century.  Beyond coastal zone management: As per BDP2100, the whole of Bangladesh is divided into seven hotspot-wise intervention programmes. The implementation of this project will put unlimited amount of control of the national development agenda in the hand of consulting firms, which cannot be acceptable for a sovereign nation. Getting locked in a long-term maintenance contract: The proposed BDP2100 is designed to last at least another 50 to 100 years. Bangladesh will be locked in a maintenance contract with the consulting firms for the entire duration of the project and beyond. It will be unwise to put our future generations under such an obligation. Missing the SDGs:As a signatory of the SDGs, Bangladesh is expected to implement the goals following the targets set by the UN. However, there is no mention of any SDG in the proposed plan.   Which way should we go now?Bangladesh needs to abandon the structural approach in managing coastal zones, and adopt an ecological or open approach to water resources management. Bangladesh, along with 194 other nations, has embarked on the sustainable development goals that are proposed by the UN for the next 15 years. Bangladesh needs to devote more resources to improve national capability building that will be necessary to implement land and water management projects in the context of SDGs. It is equally important for the country to work on achieving water sharing agreements for all transboundary rivers with all co-riparian nations in the GBM basins before adopting an ambitious plan like BDP2100, which cannot be successful without adequate flow of water and sediments during lean seasons.

      "text": "Methamphetamine, commonly known as \"yaba,\" has over the last decade taken a hold on our society as it went from a trendy, synthetic drug for the elite to mass consumption. Today, yaba hauls by authorities run into millions of tablets a year, but it is a losing battle.  It made its appearance in 2010 and 81,000 tablets were seized that year. In 2016, that number had risen to 29.5 million. Today, two million tablets are consumed daily in Bangladesh and it is pouring in over the Naf River in Myanmar. But is it only Myanmar that is producing it in different colours or do we have a regional problem here? From what has been published in the media, yaba is a cheap synthetic drug that requires no natural ingredients. Hence, unlike cannabis or heroin, it can be produced in a laboratory which has made this drug's widespread use so easy. Back in 2012, the drug cartels in Myanmar decided to shift their supply chain of yaba through Bangladesh because the traditional route through Thailand had effectively been checked by the China-Thailand joint programme 'Safe Mekong' which cut off the usual movement of drugs through Thailand. Increasingly, we have found that local production of the drug is taking hold in Bangladesh. In an effort to stem the rise of domestically produced yaba, the government has taken steps to ban the import of cold-medicine component pseudoephedrine, a key ingredient in the making of yaba tablets. According to narcotics officials, evidence has emerged that labs situated on the Myanmar-Bangladesh border, which is largely unpatrolled, are producing yaba tablets in their millions. Pseudoephedrine, the import of which skyrocketed by more than six times to around 20 tonnes from five years ago, was being diverted to the production of the finished product.  It is good to see that local industry is responding but it is too early to comment whether the ban will have its intended effect. With Bangladesh becoming a transit point for this particular chemical for use--not just in Myanmar but in other countries in the region--we will have to wait and see if the ban will have the desired effect because there is the risk of Indian pseudoephedrine being re-routed through Bangladesh to reach factories in Myanmar unless similar steps are taken in that country. Since 2012, we have seen the rapid proliferation of yaba usage from a trickle to a flood. Bangladesh became a natural choice for smugglers due to the fact that it shares a 4,000km porous border with India. In a recent article titled \"Inside Bangladesh's methamphetamine problem\" published on July 23 in asia.nikkei.com, Tom Kramer, a Myanmar expert with the international research and advocacy body Transnational Institute is quoted as saying, \"rebel groups in Myanmar like the United WA State Army have been accused of simply shifting from the opium and heroin business to amphetamine manufacturing. The increase in production and use of amphetamine pills has been driven by both demand and supply, as well as profound socio-economic changes in the affected countries, which have moved from rural agricultural based economies to urban, industrial and market-based societies.\" A growing middle class in Bangladesh means more money in the hands of people. That social acceptance to this multi-coloured pill is ever-increasing has health practitioners and policymakers worried about the health, criminal and psychological implications this \"crazy medicine\" will have for the country. With yaba usage being touted as a symbol of smartness and the ease with which it can be carried and peddled, the worry is how fast it becomes the staple for the 15-30 age group which makes up a third of Bangladesh's population. With prices ranging from Tk 300 to Tk 1,800 (depending on grade) for a single pill, there is no official data on the exact number of users in the country. An overdose of the brightly coloured pills can result in hyperthermia convulsions and death while side effects can cause users to become violent, suffer from paranoia, confusion, anxiety and insomnia. It has been touted as a slimming agent and one that increases energy.  Campaign against drugs is a tricky issue. Law enforcement is just one facet. Beyond media campaigns, treatment and rehabilitation, what we need is an education strategy that takes the message to children in the schooling system. Indeed, school-based programmes, particularly at the secondary school level are where drugs take hold. We have to understand that any such programme will take years to yield positive results. The new emphasis is on building self-esteem and skills in problem-solving and communication. Mere bombardment of information on drugs (as had been the case previously) has not worked and the new approach replaces lectures with student participation. It is all about providing children with coping skills to face situations that can lead to drug abuse; help recognise pressures that influence them to smoke or use drugs; and resist peer pressure. These are the findings of UN International Drug Control Programme from more than two decades ago, and something our policymakers need to look into.

READ MORE: No Pahela Baishakh in Haor\n Experts say it is a plague caused by the rotting half-ripe paddy and dead fish. They fear these animals could cause harm to human beings if the dead fishes and birds are consumed. Dr Mamunur Rashid, deputy director of Agriculture Extension Department in Sylhet, said: \"The toxicity of the water has risen due to the rotting half-ripe paddies. It caused the death of fowls.\"  Dr Nasrin Sultana, veterinary and animal science department head at Sylhet Agriculture University, said the \"dark plague\" can be caused by rotting paddy and dead fishes. \"If consumed, the fishes or birds, it may cause harm to human beings - especially the old and children,\" she said. EDITORIAL: Plight of haor people Fisheries department head at the university Dr Md Shahabuddin said the water has been dangerously tampered with the ammonia released by the rotten fish. \"It is essential to monitor that nobody is allowed to eat the fishes or birds in any form,\" he said. Authorities have moved swiftly into treating the water at the haor. Large chunks of limestone have been added to the water and loudspeakers were announcing people to stay away from catching the dead fishes, said Mosharraf Hossain, deputy director for divisional fisheries. So far, 5,300 kilogrammes of limestone have been added to the water to redeem the toxicity level, Sultan Mahmud, senior fisheries officer at Kulaura upazila, said today."

For proper implementation, a development plan must be based on people's opinions, he said, adding that public participation helped identify problems and find solutions. The DAP authorities should seek localised solution to the needs and challenges of any locality, Ashraful Islam told a public consultation on DAP preparation. He took local people's suggestions on what their development needs and challenges are at Kaundia Union Parishad, organised by DAP consultants and Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk). The UP chairman, Atiqur Rahman Khan Shantu, and local residents wanted a road network in the proposed DAP because their villages were isolated from the capital by the Balu and Bongshi rivers on all sides. They also badly need a bridge (connecting Kaundia with Mirpur Diabari), playgrounds, waste management facilities, and road expansion in the 11.47 sq km area of the union with 1.1 lakh inhabitants, said the chairman. Such consultations give locals a platform to share their views on what they lack and where to develop facilities and identify land for residential and commercial establishments. Ashraful Islam said they planned 150 such consultations, and people's opinions would be incorporated into the draft plan, which would again be brought before people for scrutiny. This will simply spare people the hassles of correcting flaws in the plan and Rajuk the hassles of resolving hundreds of complaints, he said. With the existing DAP's 15-year term expiring in 2015 and most of its vital recommendations on wetland and flood flow zone conservation remaining unimplemented, Rajuk embarked on preparing another 20-year DAP in March 2015 for the period from 2016 to 2035. Though it was supposed to be completed by April this year, Rajuk extended the deadline till December. But with less than half of the ground work done so far, DAP cannot be ready by December, said Rajuk officials. Ashraful said he would probably need one more year, and hoped to complete the new DAP by the end of the next year. Rajuk chief town planner Sirajul Islam, who had been the DAP project director for the last two years, said he could not complete the ground survey because the \"1,531 sq km area under DAP is so vast.\" According to the process, on completion of surveys and public consultations, the consultants will submit interim reports, and a draft plan will be prepared. After another round of public consultations on the draft plan, the DAP will be ready for implementation. Sheltech Consultants Ltd and The Decode Ltd are the consultants of the new DAP."

What American biologist Norman Borlaug initiated in Mexican wheat fields during the mid-20th century, the first breeder of then newly established International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Dr Peter Jennings, did the same for rice. Together, these two men brought a phenomenal change in rice and wheat production thereby ushering in a Green Revolution, long being credited for averting a billion deaths.   Dwarfing of wheat and rice plants, thereby turning the world's two of the most consumed staples highly yielding, was a game changer. It saw Mexico becoming a net wheat exporter by 1963, India and Pakistan literally doubling their wheat baskets between 1965 and 1970, Borlaug winning a deserving Nobel in peace in 1970 and nations across Asia, Africa, Latin America and elsewhere benefiting from semi-dwarf 'Miracle Rice' IR8.      IRRI's hand in helping the rice-eating world through breeding better varieties of rice began shortly after the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations established the Institute with the help of the Philippine government in 1960. IRRI scientists sought to replicate in rice what had been done in wheat in Mexico, and successfully bred IR8--a semi-dwarf variety that journalists dubbed 'Miracle Rice' because it could produce twice the amount of rice grains that tall varieties produced. IR8 has been credited with averting a humanitarian crisis that would have otherwise plunged the world's poor into abject hunger. Since then, more than 900 IRRI varieties have been released in 78 countries, across five continents. Some of these were bred to be resistant to insects or diseases, and they can withstand poor soils.  In November 2016, IRRI celebrated the 50th anniversary of the official release of the semi-dwarf rice variety IR8 to Asia and the world. It became popular with farmers because it had short growth duration and a high-yield capacity related to its response to nitrogen fertiliser. Since that time (the mid-20th century) the world has seen its population grow from 2.5 billion (1950) to 7.4 billion (2016) and its per capita arable land nearly halve from 0.37 hectares (1961) to 0.197 (2013).    Half of today's world population depends on rice for survival, and, owing to predicted population increases and a general trend towards urbanisation, per hectare of land that currently provides enough rice to feed 27 people will need to support 43 by 2050. In December 2021, Bangladesh will celebrate 50 years of independence. Keeping that timeframe in consideration, Bangladesh's Vision 2021 rightly set goals: a) to become a participatory democracy; b) to have an efficient, accountable, transparent and decentralised system of governance; c) to become a poverty-free middle-income country; d) to have a nation of healthy citizens; to develop a skilled and creative human resource; e) to become a globally integrated regional economic and commercial hub; and f) to be environmentally sustainable; and to be a more inclusive and equitable society.  In 1971, we had a population of 75 million and our food production was a little over 10 million metric tonnes. Thanks to adoption of modern farm technologies, policy support, better breeds and inputs and above all a hard working farming community, today we grow over 35 million metric tonnes of cereal crops.  So it's true that since the Borlaug and Jennings days, the world's food production grew dramatically keeping pace with an alarmingly faster rate of population growth. To cite a country-specific example, we can easily refer to the Bangladesh scenario. Over the past four decades, Bangladesh succeeded outpacing the population growth rate with its growth in rice output. The country has more than tripled the production of its staple in the space of 45 odd years. But questions arise whether we have reached a plateau - where any further growth in farm outputs would be too hard to achieve. We have a large population base and despite a falling population growth rate, it'll take a few more years before we get stabilised by the time farmlands continue to get scarcer thanks to rapid urbanisation, industrialisation and infrastructure developments.  Achieving self-sufficiency in rice at this point of time is no way perpetual. History shows we have reached such points in a few occasions in the past when output matched the demands but again we did slip back - not because of any production decrease rather, because of population increase.  More importantly, attaining autarky in rice, the staple, is not enough to proclaim ourselves food self-sufficient. We need a reality check here. After rice, maize emerges as the second most important cereal crop relegating wheat into third position in Bangladesh. More importantly, attaining autarky in rice, the staple, is not enough to proclaim ourselves food self-sufficient. We need a reality check here. After rice, maize emerges as the second most important cereal crop relegating wheat into third position in Bangladesh. We're still not able to meet the total domestic requirements of maize thanks to a huge feed demand triggered by a burgeoning fish and poultry industry. And over 75 percent of our annual wheat demands are met by imports.   Currently, more than 790 million people in the world do not have enough to eat, and over 280 million, in other words, nearly a third of food-starved people, live in our part of the world (South Asia). Producing enough food does not necessarily guarantee people's right to food. To make sure people have rightful access to food all the time, ensuring its availability, stability, accessibility, sustainability and adequacy is equally important.     Standing at this crossroads, we need to revisit the whole range of farming issues - how sustainable the heavily input-driven production system is, how prudent it is to overexploit our fast depleting groundwater table and what would be our coping mechanisms to face impacts of climate change in the farm sector. Prior to Green Revolution we had rain-fed rice like Aman and Aus but thanks to introduction or irrigated dry season rice Boro during the winter there has been phenomenal growth in the staple output. But for that to happen we started sinking millions of shallow and deep-set pumps to draw water from underground and irrigate the Boro rice. At the same time we started using chemical fertilizers and pesticides. We had also advanced in farm mechanisation thereby dwindling the numbers of our draft animals, which were also a big source of dung, the natural manure.     Climate-induced stresses are becoming all the more challenging. Extreme weather conditions like prolonged flood, shorter winter, drought and salinity pose huge challenges. Too much mining of groundwater in the north (greater Rajshahi, Rangpur-Dinajpur region) for irrigating rice lands creates vacuums underneath, giving more inroads for the southern saline water to seep in. To some count a tenth of our cultivable lands are saline-prone to varied levels.     To address these challenges scientists have taken up an uphill task of developing various crop varieties that can withheld stress conditions and are genetically better bred giving extra vigour and higher productivity.   Growing rice with less water\nIt takes 14 million litres of irrigation water to produce six tonnes of Boro rice on one hectare of typical farmland in Bangladesh. A farmer has to burn 250 litres of diesel to run a shallow pump, owned or hired, to irrigate this single hectare of paddy field. If translated into minuscule unit, each kilogram of rice reaches our plates from the farm at the expense of 3,500 litres of immensely valuable fresh water. One Bangladeshi agronomist took it upon himself to see what difference he could make in terms of water conservation and save the country from an ecological disaster. Irrigated-rice Boro contributes 55 percent of Bangladesh's nearly 35 million tonnes of yearly rice output and heavily sucks on a rapidly depleting groundwater. Professor Moshiur Rahman, who teaches agronomy at Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) in Mymensingh, negated the notion that rice in dry season has to grow in puddle condition, soaked field and in standing water. Rahman wanted to challenge the notion and began with an on-campus experiment back in 2006-07. In the last 10 years, Rahman reached out to plots of many farmers in six rice-rich districts, and reached a conclusion--rice can be grown using less than half the irrigation water in Boro season. Rahman and his team conserved water by not growing seedlings in the nursery. They, rather, directly sowed in the dry field by plowing furrows and did not puddle or soak the field with water, thereby saving some water as well. They didn't keep standing water in the paddy field during the period between panicle initiation and grain-filling. In the direct-seeded Boro rice technology, Professor Rahman said, what farmers are required to do is keep the seeds soaked in water for 24 hours and then incubate the soaked seeds for another 30 to 40 hours prior to sowing in the paddy field. From the results of his experiments with the direct-seeded rice technology in Rajshahi, Rangpur, Dinajpur, Tangail, Netrokona and Mymensingh over the last 10 years, Rahman showed statistical evidence that in the most conservative estimate, 50 percent less water was required for growing rice with equally productive yield. If further tweaking makes the water-conserving rice production system work fine, then it will definitely be a great relief for rice-rich northern region of Bangladesh that has long over-exploited groundwater in irrigation. Around 88 percent of total fresh water is used for agriculture in the country and rice production accounts for 73 percent of that water. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) stated in a report, \"In some parts of the country, particularly the Barind Tracts in the northwest region, there are already symptoms of deterioration in the natural hydrological regime. Declining groundwater levels have affected water quality causing it to affect soils, the growth of agricultural crops, flora and fauna and to increase health hazards.\"  Rice going southbound\nIt couldn't have been better timed for rice breeders in Bangladesh to come up with more solutions for southern farmers when the government is all out in its efforts to make rice southbound giving relief to the north that has long been over mined for groundwater to irrigate winter rice Boro. Scientists have come up with a solution for southern farmers who have long been deprived of the benefits of high-yield modern rice varieties (MVs) that cannot grow on tidal wetlands. After 12 years of arduous breeding process, they succeeded in developing two modern varieties suitable for cultivation in the tidal floodplain ecosystem of the southern delta region, with the promise of an additional yield of one million tonnes a year. Against 2.5 to 3 tonnes of rice per hectare, which farmers reap from traditional varieties, the new modern varieties - BRRI dhan77 and BRRI dhan78 - will bring about 4 tonnes of crops a hectare during the Aman season in July-December, according to Helal Uddin Ahmed, a chief scientific officer at Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI). While farmers elsewhere have already switched to MVs from low-yield traditional varieties, rice growers in over a million hectares of tidal wetlands have had to remain satisfied with homegrown varieties.  For so long indigenous varieties have performed better than modern varieties on tidal floodplains because seedlings of the former are taller than the latter. As the region is at the proximity of the sea and inland estuaries, shorter seedlings often fail to survive the water flowing in and out with high tide and low tide twice a day. BRRI dhan77 and BRRI dhan78 are bred in a way in which their seedlings would be tall in size and survive the tidal wetland condition. The newly developed breeding lines will meet southern farmers' aspiration for higher yields in the Aman season.  Nationwide modern varieties coverage in rice cultivation has increased from 25 percent in 1972 to over 80 percent now, but their penetration in the tidal regions of Barisal, Patuakhali, Jhalakathi, Pirojpur, Bhola, Bagerhat and Gopalganj has remained at 15 percent for all these years. The new MVs come as a breakthrough offering the southern farmers a good choice to shift from low-yield homegrown varieties like Sadamota, Lalmota, Moulata, and Dudhkalom.  Meanwhile, as saline water continues to creep in, scientists are also continuing their efforts to develop rice varieties that can withstand a certain degree of salinity. In recent years, Bangladeshi scientists developed four transgenic rice varieties capable of production in high soil salinity, far better than the ones derived through conventional breeding.  A particular pea gene - helicase - was infused into four high yielding rice varieties (HYVs) that helped rice plants have higher salt tolerance and higher yield potential. A team led by Dhaka University's Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Professor Zeba Islam Seraj made it possible after a decade of research. In lab and net house, the transgenic varieties had shown potential to yield up to 50 percent more than the available salt-tolerant HYVs in saline-stressed soil. In Bangladesh, one million hectares out of a total nine million hectares of cultivable land are salinity affected, and the vulnerability is more profound during the dry season. That's why the scientists chose the dry season Boro rice varieties first for the gene transfusion. Climate change is a reality and so is the farming sector's resilience to it in Bangladesh. With limited resources at hand and a rapidly increasing population to feed, some 18 million farming households in Bangladesh have shown fortitude against all odds. Farmers never called it quits in their constant fight against natural calamities, shrinkage of farmland, market irregularities, and all sorts of resource limitations. From Green Revolution to Gene Revolution\nGiven the fact that world population would continue to increase for many more years to come and farm resources - land, water, etc. - would continue to get scarcer, the global food regime would definitely require a big push to the scale of mid-20th century. Green Revolution was to some extent chemical-driven - the increased productivity was gained largely by use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. While it was widely recognised that Green Revolution came as a blessing for mankind when fear of famine was haunting a large part of developing economies, there is no denial that injudicious applications of chemicals had long-term bearings on environment and ecology. Currently, a lot of the efforts of scientists are centred on biological maneuvering so that better breeds can be derived which are more productive and less susceptive to stresses like cold, drought, submergence, salinity, etc.    What scientists and journalists sometimes tout as Gene Revolution has to come through scientific advancement, better understanding of genetic structures and functioning of different plant species and sub-species. In recent months, genomes of 186 Bangladeshi rice varieties have been sequenced in Beijing Genomics Institute, China as part of a global collaborative project, opening up new opportunities for varietal developments. These include rice germplasms, high yielding varieties (HYVs) and advanced lines. Germplasm is the living genetic resources such as seeds or tissue that is maintained for the purpose of animal and plant breeding, preservation and other research uses.  C4 - The next big thing  \nAn IRRI literature reads, \"Only 29 percent of the earth's surface is land and only a little over a third of that is suitable for agriculture; the rest is ice, desert, forest or mountain and is unsuitable for farming. More simply stated, only 10 percent of the surface of the earth has topographical and climatic conditions suitable for producing the food requirements of human beings.\" It further reads, \"Sixty percent of the world's population lives in Asia, where each hectare of land used for rice production currently provides food for 27 people, but by 2050 that land will have to support at least 43 people. Nonetheless, the area for rice cultivation is continually being reduced by expansion of cities and industries, to say nothing of soil degradation.\"    For the past few year scientists have embarked upon an uphill task of changing the biophysical structure of the rice plant, making it a much more efficient user of solar energy. Solar energy captured in photosynthesis over the duration of a crop gives it the capacity to grow. Rice has what is known as a C3 photosynthetic pathway, less efficient than that of maize, which has a C4 pathway.  A galaxy of scientists drawn from IRRI to Oxford University, from Chinese Academy of Sciences to Cambridge University, is now working on an ambitious project so that rice can be converted into a C4 plant from a C3 plant. An Oxford University release said, \"If rice could be 'switched' to use C4 photosynthesis, it would theoretically increase productivity by 50 percent.\" As well as an increase in photosynthetic efficiency, introduction of C4 traits into rice is predicted to improve nitrogen use efficiency, double water use efficiency, and increase tolerance to high temperatures, according to Oxford University, as the C4 rice project entered, what the scientists say into third phase in December 2015.

Mara shak is being sold at Tk 25 to Tk 30 a kilogram at the local markets while it was Tk 8 to Tk 10 three weeks ago, farmers said. Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) Deputy Director (DD) Bidubhushon Roy said mara shak is a local variety that is available in Kurigram, Rangpur and Nilphamari. \"Farmers can harvest this variety of spinach within 55 to 60 days,\" he added. Soleman Ali, 50, of Fulgachh village in Sadar upazila said he cultivated the vegetables on 14 decimals of land spending Tk 1,500. He said he thought that he would earn Tk 3,000 to Tk 3,500 profit from selling all the spinach in the field, but now hopes to get double that amount. He said he sold 130 kg at Tk 25 per kg last week and expect to get 180 kg more. Nurul Islam, 45, said mara shak is a popular variety of spinach locally. He said they cultivate it for consumption as well as for sale to get additional income. \"We only need to take proper care of the vegetable field,\" he added. Ashraf Ali, 52, of Saptibari village in Aditmari upazila, said they have been farming mara shak for the last four years, adding that they did not have any idea about this variety earlier.  Vegetable trader Sirajul Islam, 42, at Goshala Bazar in the town, said people are buying the vegetable as it is available in the market while supply of other varieties is very low due to flood. He said they are selling mara shak at Tk 30 per kg. Schoolteacher Delwar Hossain, 46, a resident of College Road in the town, said they love spinach, but they are forced to buy it at high price due to short supply of other varieties of vegetables."

Due to washing away of two more embankments-'Gachikhai' and 'Joypur' embankments in Khaliajury upazila, over 90 percent area of the upazila has gone under water, said Mohammed Tofael Ahmed, upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) of Khaliajury. Many areas of the upazila's Krishnapur and Nagor unions experienced fresh flood yesterday, said the UNO. A government relief of 28 tonnes of rice has been distributed among some 1000 flood victims in the upazila on Friday, the UNO said. But the report on fresh areas affected yesterday was not received yet, said Bilash Chandra Pal, deputy director (DD) of the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) of the district. Until Friday, flash flood triggered by heavy rainfall submerged around 38,115 out of 184,320 hectares of land targeted for boro cultivation in eight upazilas of Netrakona, said the deputy director. Gopendra Das, a farmer of Krishtapur village in Khaliajury said the flood has left him helpless as his three acres of boro land was damaged. Satu Sarker of Bigolhati and Bhajon Sarker of Baniahati villages in the upazila lamented saying, \"What would be our fate as we cannot save even an inch of land from the flood?\" Standing robi crops like groundnut, wheat, potato and vegetables were also affected in the flood, local people said. The flash flood affected mainly the haor areas as Kirtankhola embankment in Khaliajury and Dingapota Haizda embankment in Mohanganj upazila were washed away at some points, said the DD. Though there was no rain in the last three days, the flood situation did not show any sign of improvement. The affected farmers are yet to be listed to provide with necessary supports, he said. The flood affected people of haor areas are passing hard days due to the flash flood caused by the onrush of water from Indian hills and the government should immediately stand beside the victims, said Sanwar Hossain, chairman of Sadar union parishad of Khaliajury. However, the flood situation remained unchanged in Kishoreganj district. No fresh areas was flooded since Friday, said Md Shafiqul Islam, deputy director of DAE in Kishoreganj. On Friday, 23,620 out of 165,515 hectares of land targeted for boro farming in seven upazilas of the district had gone under water, said the deputy director. The affected boro will face a total damage as the crop was in its flowering stage, said the official. The DAE sources said, some 30,000 farmers have been affected in the flash flood triggered due to overflow of water from the Kushiara, Kalani and Khowai rivers. The affected farmers will be provided with assistance until the next boro season, he said."

      "text": "The World Bank recently organised a symposium on Dhaka's urban future and planned expansion into the east. The urban policy advocacy at the symposium was driven by what Martin Rama, the WB chief economist for South Asia, encapsulated in this statement: \"Whatever happens to Dhaka, happens to Bangladesh.\" In other words, if Dhaka fails, Bangladesh fails. Therefore, Dhaka must be properly planned and expanded to shoulder this national burden. This policy position probably makes sense but it is dangerous. The broader planning question here is: should we let Dhaka expand more or de-escalate its growth frenzy? Should we save Dhaka from over-development by investing in other cities of Bangladesh, thus encouraging decentralisation? It is no news that Dhaka as a megalopolis is creaking at all its urban seams. Traffic congestion is infernal. Even after moderate rains, waterlogging frequently paralyses city life. According to the website Demographia, Dhaka's urban population density is highest in the world at 114,300 people per square mile. On average, 70 people from rural Bangladesh pour into Dhaka every hour in search of jobs and better lives. Over 200 registered motor vehicles enter the city streets every day. Things couldn't be more intense and crowded. How long can Dhaka keep on growing? Has the city reached its limit? It is time we seriously considered the environmental and social cost of urban expansion ad infinitum. The World Bank's vision for Dhaka 2035 is understandable. Between 1995 and 2005, there has been a widening gap between demand and supply. Road surface in Dhaka increased by only 5 percent, while population surged by 50 percent and traffic by 134 percent. Qimiao Fan, World Bank Country Director, stated: \"Based on current trends, Dhaka will have more than 35 million people by 2035. A productive and liveable city of this scale can make enormous contributions to its citizens and the economy.\" What is implied here is that the capital city's existing land area is insufficient to meet its projected urban demand. Thus, Dhaka's \"empty\" eastern territory could be the answer. Build the eastern embankment, and \"there would be an enormous tract of land which is now flooded.\" These \"grow more\" and \"go east\" solutions for Dhaka give rise to disconcerting questions. That there is an \"enormous tract of land\" on the eastern side of Dhaka is a myth. If it were a land in the first place, it has already been occupied by powerful corporations and developers who see profit as the only way forward. Just keep going through Khilkhet toward the Balu River and then Shitalakhya River. It feels like a haunted journey through a postmodern wasteland of silvery sand, occasionally interrupted by anaemic rivulets and the sand-carrying barges that navigate through them. In the midst of the area's unsettling quiet, if you try, you can hear the cry of the people who were coerced to sell their ancestral aqua-lands that once defined Dhaka's eastern frontier. Why is this area now a vast land of sand? That's because most of Dhaka east has never been a land in the first place. It used to be a floodplain, a sprawling low-lying hydrography that acted like an ecological sponge, absorbing flood water, water from the city's natural drain networks, and rainwater runoffs. And, the locals lived off this land-water geography. Alas, like other low-lying regions of the city, land-grabbers have filled up the east with impunity. City developer agencies like Rajuk not only watched the \"ecocide\" from the sidelines, but also participated in it. For example, the Rajuk-developed housing project Purbachal, a 6,000-plus acre floodplain between Balu and Shitalakhya, is now, say, a 10-feet-thick mass of neo-Coleridgian \"sand, sand, everywhere.\" Where would the massive quantity of water that used to drain into the eastern floodplains go now? Why are we surprised about waterlogging in the city?  The World Bank's Dhaka 2035 is curious. Seeing the city's eastern frontier as an \"enormous empty land\" ready to be transformed into a mega-shop for economic productivity is to ignore some of the basic tenets of liveable cities that are being championed today around the world. At the centre of the debate is: Should economic growth take precedence over ecological well-being? Economy and ecology should not be mutually exclusive. An ecologically balanced city is good for the economy in the long run. Seoul recently replaced a massive, hovering expressway that pierced the city's central district with a water stream, rejuvenating down town social life. New York is transforming vehicular streets into pedestrian community spaces. And, business is growing. Development ignoring the city's geographic DNA is bad business. There are no universal Pudong urban templates. Cities like Seoul, Melbourne, Portland (Oregon), and Medellin (Colombia), among others, teach us how existing cities could be reimagined and reorganised to serve the social and economic needs of their people. Instead of drumming up Dhaka's mega-expansion, the World Bank should invest in developing other mid-sized Bangladeshi cities sustainably, while partnering with the government in recuperating Dhaka's eastern floodplains as land-water-green national parks. Invest in Dhaka's low-cost public transportation as community building tools, not in Pudongs as blueprints for Dhaka east. Help reduce demand for cars rather than lamenting the loss of car speed on city streets. Invest in robust social campaigns to motivate the youth to ride bicycles to work rather than glorifying 300-feet-wide roads and flyovers as symbols of urban future. Invest in safe footpaths that would create a culture of pedestrianism. Help deglamorise car ownership. Invest in people-centric, humane cities. Economy will follow, sustainably. *Illustration copyright: Amy Casey, with permission for one time use.\nAdnan Morshed is an architect, architectural historian, and urbanist, and currently serving as Chairperson of the Department of Architecture at BRAC University.

      "text": "That was basically the message realtors had given Rajuk in early November in a views-sharing meeting. Realtors believe it is ludicrous for Rajuk to try and reclaim what has already been grabbed. Indeed, that meeting could easily be termed a circus, since it was said that Dhaka would be better off without its wetlands since it was pointed out by a representative that the only purpose of water bodies is to serve the mosquito population. Never mind the experts' opinions and feasibility studies that wetlands are mandatory for the city's natural drainage system. Never mind the fact that the city, which was once defined by its aqua lands, has lost around 2,500 acres of flood flow zones and agricultural lands. Rajuk remains silent against this relentless drive by the high-and-mighty coterie of wetland grabbers and presently we are witnessing the demise of the Dumni canal on the city's eastern outskirts. The canal is in the final throes of being filled up and going by what has been printed in The Daily Star on December 24, a 120-foot-wide canal is now 10-foot-wide. \"Half a dozen land claimants--three real estate developers, two private land claimants and a government organisation--have so far either blocked and filled up parts of the canal or narrowed it down to one-twelfth of its official width since 2009,\"s aid locals. So this has been going on since 2009. But then, protests have been falling on deaf ears of the authorities. In the midst of all this, we have a chief engineer of Rajuk going on record to state that the building of a culvert which narrows the canal's width to 10 feet is \"not a problem, water will flow anyway. Width of a canal is to be reduced if a structure is built over it.\" This is in contradiction to the 2006 study by British Halcrow Group on flood management that recommended widening and conserving existing canals along with storm water retention ponds and areas as flood management measures. When we look at the history of filling up of water bodies, and that includes rivers like the Turag, one finds a pattern that is followed by realtors. They seldom act alone. Countless reports have emerged in media about how adept they are at skirting the legal system and \"managing\" enough leverage among both the custodians of water bodies and enforcers of the law to effectively kill canals and rivers. Last year, this paper ran a story on the Turag River which outlined the systematic destruction of Turag starting from the year 2009. Once a mighty river, touted as one of the key rivers that supplies water to the city, has been witness to relentless encroachment by land grabbers who have filled up major chunks of the river and turned them into theme parks, housing estates, industries, etc. What we have lost in the process is supply of freshwater for human consumption and agriculture, fish resources, marine ecology and waterfront. Land grabbing has flourished unabated without giving two hoots to a 2009 landmark High Court judgment that had delineated detailed measures on how ailing rivers may be recovered on five rivers feeding Dhaka , viz. Buriganga, Balu, Turag, Sitalakkhya and Dhaleshwari. While the mighty Turag has fallen prey to land grabbers in a big way, we have managed to kill the Sitalakkhya with the dumping of untreated toxic industrial discharge. The water of the Sitalakkhya is as black as that of Buriganga, which until very recently was home to the leather industry at Hazaribagh. Going by recent news, we understand that not all factories have relocated to the new leather estate in Savar and the dumping of toxic material continues there. While a major chunk of tanneries have moved, there are other factories in the vicinity that follow the same custom of discharging untreated chemical waste into the river. Amid much fanfare, the tanneries were moved to the leather estate. There too problems persist. Land had been allocated, but the problems associated with who would bear what portion of cost of the central effluent plant (CETP) were allowed to fester whilst many units went into production. So, while Buriganga may see a revival of sorts somewhere down the years, it appears that the Dhaleshwari is now going downhill. It does not matter which river or canal we highlight in media, the bottom line is that we have a DAP that is not followed by authorities. We have various agencies which have proven themselves to be utterly inept, toothless and powerless in the face of land-grabbing companies which are backed by serious political clout. We have seen that public outrage and outcry mean little to anyone in office and that laws are there to adorn the books but not be implemented. We live in a system that is built around powerful vested interests where profit is king and where the environment and people's collective voice do not count.

      "text": "The Third World must start over a new history of man which takes account of not only the occasional prodigious theses maintained by Europe but also its crimes, the most heinous of which have been committed at the heart of very man, the pathological dismembering of his functions and the erosion of his unity, and in the context of the community, the fracture, the stratification and the bloody tensions fed by class, and finally, on the immense scale of humanity, the racial hatred, slavery, exploitation and above all, the bloodless genocide whereby one and a half billion men have been written off.\n--Frantz Fanon (2004: 238)\n --Frantz Fanon (2004: 238) Ahmed Sofa (1943-2001) was already a legend down and out in Dhaka, if not beyond, when he lay dying. He was not well for years before breathing his last. Ahmed Sofa's true legend, however, did not begin with this death on July 28, 2001. As in most other cases of our literature, his legend too began with an encounter with poetry, that universal goddess. He however discovered his true calling before long in language as such, plunging in a melange of prose and poetry alike, closing in on the heels of Bengali literature's colonial greats, Michael Madhusudhan, Bankimchandra, Rabindranath, Nazrul Islam and a few others who matter. Perhaps part of the reason Sofa was destined to translate Wolfgang Goethe's Faust, part one, lay in this melange of poetic ambitions in a prosaic neo-colonial world. But, for all that, he would not abandon that good old poetic craft. On this occasion of Ahmed Sofa's sixteenth death anniversary I propose to provide a very short introduction to the reading of a narrative poem that he wrote in our apocalyptic mid-1970s. In 1975, Sofa published two slim volumes, in quick succession of one another, namely Jallad Somoi (Time, the Hangman) and Dukkher Diner Doha (Dog Day Songs), the latter containing a longish narrative poem named Basteeujar (Evicting a Slum). He prided himself a good deal on account of this poem. For instance, however ill-matching his key to the master's house might be, Ahmed Sofa once dared a transformation of this poem into a broken English prose, coming quite late in the day, though. The petite bourgeois milieu which he was placed to live in condescended to understand his worth rarely, if ever. I must note, however, that Faizul Latif Chowdhury, a good critic and a leading specialist on the acclaimed poet Jibanananda Das, has paid a no-nonsense tribute to this great poem of Ahmed Sofa's. It seems like finally a wind is blowing. (Chowdhury 2017: 27) I should perhaps begin by introducing myself in connection with Ahmed Sofa, who I met for the first time in the summer of 1976. He was then registered as a graduate research student with Dhaka University and living in the northern premises of the University and I, as a fledgling freshman, was just admitted into one of the nearby dorms. At the time he was at work on his doctoral dissertation, under the supervision of the famed Professor Abdur Razzaq, on the growth of a middle class among the Muslims of Bengal (or more aptly, the Bengali Muslims). Ahmed Sofa was not like any other intellectual I knew at that time. Ever since 1962, when he first moved inside Dhaka, Ahmed Sofa took no leave from the city except perhaps for twice or thrice only, once for a sly break to Brahmanbaria College from where he took his baccalaureate diploma and a second time over to perhaps the Indian states of Tripura and West Bengal as a political refugee in 1971. Ahmed Sofa and Dhaka, thereafter, even in death remained virtually in a deadlock. His remains were finally buried in a common man's ground in Mirpur, in some sort of a slum for the dead, not far from the burial ground officially consecrated for the nation's martyred intellectuals and other stalwarts. Thus, even in his death Ahmed Sofa lives outside in the nation's ceremonial high ground. Not long away and not far from the space he lived in then, where now stand some of the newer student dormitories of the Dhaka University, a squatter settlement or slum flourished, or so I was told on my first encounter by Ahmed Sofa. It was demolished and its inmates driven out by force one night early in 1975. It was a human disaster but accomplished at the beck of powers that were. Ahmed Sofa happened to be a rare man among our poets who, notwithstanding all its foretold futility, was enraged enough to register his bitter protest. No one else had the guts to raise a riot that day. Ahmed Sofa's Basteeujar has been perhaps the only testimony of a time out of joints. Sofa mourned the loss, but no nostalgia took hold of him. His vision was tinged with a touch of both melancholia and utopia, as I would venture to say today. Ahmad Sofa. Photo: Nasir Ali Mamun (Photoseum) 16 August 1998 Dhaka \nAs Ahmed Sofa put it once in his perhaps more youthful days, \"Writing a poem is sort of a scandal; so I didn't go for one for real long\". Perhaps true, founding a city, or better a civilisation, that is to say, the art of living together in towns has been a scandal too. In Gilgamesh, one of the oldest poems we know on earth, we read of how Enkidu, a wild man living  in peace with the fauna of the fields and forests, was enticed down from the mountains of south-eastern Anatolia to become a town-dweller in the Mesopotamian plain, by a pretty harlot. As the myth has it, \"not unnaturally he fell for her and after seven days of her company he was no longer accepted by the animals he had lived with. He had become civilised.\" \"The myth,\" according to Gwyn Williams, a concerned scholar, \"suggests that towns are a female need, if not invention and that men would not naturally live, work and breed in towns unless trapped to this way of life by the beauty and requirements of woman.\" (Williams 1967: 48)\nFor Ahmed Sofa, the name of the harlot is \"cruel hunger\", the goddess of need, who entices the rural rabble crowding the city. \"These rural folks, like ants in queue beyond a count, drawn to honey, crowd the city,\" writes Ahmed Sofa. His imagery is no less traumatic: \"Driven by a pitiless hunger like a man-eating tiger's wrath, like the tyranny of a drought, or a savage flood dragging hillside weeds in its wake,\" as Ahmed Sofa describes the rural exodus  to the sprawling city. It's not much unlike what happens in the world of the classical economists or for that matter in Sir Arthur Lewis's two-sector growth model that divided a neo-colonial economy (a so-called \"labour-surplus economy\") into two linked sectors: a large traditional sector and a small industrial one. The traditional sector contains a large pool of low-productivity, surplus, labour upon which the industrial sector can draw. But unlike Lewis's model there is no dynamic drive here; the labour-surplus economy would not grow over time, there being no industrialisation providing \"the engine of growth\".\nLure of the town, in the imaginary of the folks, plays no small role, adds Ahmed Sofa. \"These country folks,\" in our poet's own words, \"looked at the city as if it is a fun-filled folk lore come true\". The city, in their imaginary is heaven itself; city air frees, or so they believe; it's all illumination per se. In Ahmed Sofa's poetic discourse the peasant turned migrant labourer in the city thinks much like this:\n\n\"Flood-light wreaths keep flooding city streets, playful fairies\nCrowd around; how merry they keep round the clock,\nAfternoons and evenings, adapting to the undulations of \nThe heart, music oozing out of lyrical movements, and pretty feet!\nSteam, air, water and blitz of lightning up in heaven\nServe the town like devoted, ungrudging slaves;\nCarts and autos speed along; hydrants jetting water out,\nFresh drafts swishing air out of air-machines,\nHappiness itself hangs here like a bunch of grapes.\"\n(Sofa 2008: 532)\n\nAn iron rhino or the world turned upside down\nGrapes would become sour soon enough, for sure. One fine evening, over mulled wine and cigars, powers that be decided that a whole habitat of hapless rural migrants would be bulldozed in one fell swoop. A rogue never runs out of excuses. Ahmed Sofa had just the misfortune of witnessing the unjust will of that power in action in Nilkhet slums. It was perhaps \"Time, the hangman\" who was taking over. The world turned upside down that day. It was only Ahmed Sofa who knew that things were more like signs of things to come.\n\"You can define a majority of Dhaka's denizens as \"slum dwellers\" right now too, the two city corporations boasting more than two thousand slums, thus vindicating Ahmed Sofa's prognosis forty years down the line, if farther vindication be necessary.\nAhmed Sofa casts a calm, terrible, melancholy look at the scene of mourning. In the end he would end up in an allegory of defiance of the oppressed. All that tyranny needs is a bulldozer and the poet too knows that power comes out of a barrel of a gun. Is it just a narrative motif or is there more to it? Is it a narrative which has a place inside the allegory? Who knows? You are right perhaps. \"Evicting a slum\" is more than an occasional poem, vintage 1975, for all its oriental despotism. Ahmed Sofa is no doubt witnessing a Dhaka slum, like the couple of thousand others around, fallen prostrate like a dead body sprawling in the mud after three shots in George Orwell's imperial parable. It was perhaps lying there like a non-uniformed peasant's body under the boot of one in uniform.\nRead as an allegory, \"Evicting a slum\" yields a tale of dispossession, of exile, and dispossession again. Looking back, our urban slums appear to be a reprieve, a purgatory of sorts. Doomsday cannot be too far, however. On the eve, \"a muffled fear runs aground.\" As Ahmed Sofa sees it, \"a wild rumour jumped like a prairie-fire up and, it seemed, as if some good old hard rock burst asunder in a violent eruption.\" In the end it is the other's gaze that prevails: \"It is as if the ground is sobbing and wailing, frozen so long, now letting its voice find life-giving songs\".\nAt the moment, writes Ahmed Sofa, \"pounding hearts were heard beating loud not unlike some trumpets of war.\" When the bulldozers, those \"iron rhinoceros\", as Sofa calls them, \"blind in rage and anger\" finally moved in and began ploughing pretty deep in the ground, those tiny make-believe hovels of the poorest folks felt the crushing weight of power. The other's gaze can hardly skip \"skinny naked dirty curious kids bagging a chance to see black eye to black eye those death-dealing gun-barrels\". Our melancholy flaneur, not unlike Charles Baudelaire's outsider, is in love with \"the clouds ... the clouds passing,... up there, ... up there, ... the marvellous clouds\".\n\nWomen folk muted like tamed birds \nStood not unlike a still-life painting not knowing\nRight when tears in their eyes dried up; \n\"How could you evade destiny's writ\", --the elderly murmured.\nYoung ones, faces downcast, bore with the agony,\nIt got so hard, felt like skinning a goat alive.\nThat slum-dog, man's friend but no fool himself\nGot to get barking loud, forgetting to bite the fresh bone in jaw.\n(Sofa 2008: 535)\n\nOur narrator meets a bird, shalik, ancient cliche for freedom in a cage, too grief-stricken to sing. A metonymy for home, shimul tree, casts a long shadow. A melancholy, in a word, has taken hold of the world. The poet as flaneur, not a revolutionary, sees \"flowers dropping red petals as red tear-drops in anguish\"! He sees:\n\nQuilts and pillows bundled up, shutters and window blinds,\nHousehold birds raised in cages, sundry kitchen utensils,\nTubs and bowls, mugs and lanterns, evening kerosene lamps,\nPigeons, stripes all over, flying high,\nA disoriented milking goat-mother.\nAll of man's friends living in agony for mankind.\n(Sofa 2008: 532)\n\nA call to arms\nAhmed Sofa ends on a utopian note, reiterating a call for arms. Slums, abode of the disinherited, refuge of the wretched of the earth in fact die hard; on the contrary they multiply as if in vengeance on the city. The pushing rural unemployment, crossed with the lure of urban slums, partly account for this. Man dreams but the mode disavows. \"It's impossible,\" Ahmed Sofa intervened a full quarter century later, \"to evict the slums\", reiterating what he had to disgorge in his 1975 poem. He found the slum-denizens murmuring: \"we are not going to go back to the village, does a baby get back to the mother's womb ever?\" They promise, instead, a river of blood, a war on the proud and pitiless towns.\nYou can define a majority of Dhaka's denizens as \"slum dwellers\" right now too, the two city corporations boasting more than two thousand slums, thus vindicating Ahmed Sofa's prognosis forty years down the line, if farther vindication be necessary. Dhaka is overpopulated, at the same time they, the people of the city, are overpowered too. In Marxian parlance, \"relative overpopulation\" is that part of the labour force which exceeds the regulating needs of employment for capital in the given phase of accumulation. Within this one distinguishes a \"floating\", a \"latent\" and a \"stagnant\" sector. To this three are now added new sectors every day, of the unemployed, the underemployed and the semi-employed who together form the unemployed mass of the reserve army of labour.\nAhmed Sofa, known in his lifetime as a firebrand, now appears to be no less memorable for his poems. I do not know yet how posterity is going to read him. But it is all apparent now. Sofa sometimes reminds me of the great French lyric poet Charles Baudelaire who in an apostrophe to his own poems had these to say: \"Accursed being to whom from the lowest depths of the highest heavens, nothing but me responds; you who, like a shade that leaves no more than a fleeting trace, tread lightly with a serene gaze, those foolish mortals who called you bitter, statue with jet eyes, great angel with your brow made of bronze.\" (Baudelaire 1975: 41)\nThe writer is Professor at General Education Department, ULAB.\nReferences\n1.

Sofa sometimes reminds me of the great French lyric poet Charles Baudelaire who in an apostrophe to his own poems had these to say: \"Accursed being to whom from the lowest depths of the highest heavens, nothing but me responds; you who, like a shade that leaves no more than a fleeting trace, tread lightly with a serene gaze, those foolish mortals who called you bitter, statue with jet eyes, great angel with your brow made of bronze.\" (Baudelaire 1975: 41) The writer is Professor at General Education Department, ULAB.\nReferences\n1.

      "text": "Many thoroughfares, roads and alleys in Dhaka city went under knee-to-waist-deep water, throwing life out of gear. Dhaka dwellers waded through knee-to-waist-deep water on streets as the scanty and clogged storm drainage system continued to be overwhelmed by the rain. To add to their misery, many public transport services stayed off road fearing breakdowns on flooded streets.  The capital had an astonishing 262mm of rain in 54 hours, between Thursday morning and Saturday noon, according to the Dhaka Met office records. The silver lining is that the rain that had ruined many people's weekend could ease off today, as forecast by the Met office. Roads in West Dhanmondi, Jhigatola and other parts of Dhanmondi residential area on both sides of Sat Masjid Road were severely water-logged. Many had their ground-floor homes and garages flooded. \"The wheels of the cars parked inside the ground floor of our six-storey building at West Dhanmondi had partially gone under water,\" said a local, adding that the rain finally stopped when some of the residents were thinking about jacking the cars up and putting those on stacks of bricks. Rickshaws were the dominant mode of transport yesterday; they were in great demand among office-goers and children going to schools. The rain swamped large swaths of private residential area Bashundhara as well. Thoroughfares there were waterlogged disrupting movement of locals.   Abdul Karim, a resident of Bashundhara, said, \"Small vehicles like cars and auto-rickshaws could not ply inside Bashundhara and thousands got totally stuck in their homes.\" Rubel Hossain, an Uber driver, said he somehow waded through Dhanmondi Road-27 which was under knee-deep water. Electric cables of his car got severed in the process.  \"I am avoiding any trip to Motijheel, Paltan or Moghbazar areas as vehicles would surely break down in rainwater,\" he said. Parts of Karwan Bazar, Motijheel, Farmgate, Dhanmondi, Nikunja, Mirpur, Green Road, Mohammadpur, Jatrabari, Shahjahanpur, Shantinagar, Khilgaon, Demra, Mohammadpur, Badda and several other areas in the capital were inundated.  In many places, people had to stay indoors for hours.  The traffic situation in Banasree got worse during the rain, said Shabnam Sultana, a local. The poor state of the streets compounded the sufferings of the locals, she said, adding that people had to wait for around half an hour just to get through the gate of the residential area. The stretch of Rokeya Sarani between Senpara and Sheorapara along with all adjoining lanes and by-lanes was waterlogged until noon yesterday, said east Sheorapara resident Abu Shahin.   On many thoroughfares in the city, vehicles broke down in knee-deep water. According to the Met office, it rained 149mm in the 24 hours between Friday morning and yesterday morning. Another 63mm was recorded until yesterday noon. The highest rainfall in the country was, however, recorded in Gopalganj -- 271mm in the 24 hours between Friday morning and yesterday morning.       Md Rasheduzzaman, a meteorologist and duty forecasting officer at Dhaka Met office, said such rain under the influence of depression in October and November was usual. Post-monsoon low over the Bay and those leading to land depression is not unusual in these two months, he said. The road in front of Notre Dame College in the capital looks like a river after three days of downpour. Photo: Palash Khan\n\n Rainfall may decrease from today morning as the land depression is expected to gradually weaken, said the Met office website yesterday. Our staff correspondents in Chittagong reported that tidal water coupled with rain triggered waterlogging in many low-lying areas in the port city, including Nimtoli Biswa Road, Agrabad Access Road, Arakan Road, Chaktai and Khatunganj. Most of these areas went under knee-deep water. Even though it had not rained that much yesterday morning, the heavens opened after 3:00pm flooding Lal Chand Road, KB Aman Ali Road, DC Road, Telipatti Road and some parts of Bahaddarhat to Shah Amanat Bridge Connecting Road. Many areas of Shulak Bahar, Bahaddarhat, Kapashgola, Dewanbazar, Sholoshahar, Prabartan intersection, Muradpur, and Oxygen intersection were also inundated. Most of the streets mentioned were in poor state which added to the sufferings of the port city dwellers. A flooded and almost deserted street in Motijheel. The photos were taken yesterday afternoon. Photo: Palash Khan\n\n Haider Ali, president of Chaktai Trade and Industries Association, said many businesses just had to close the shutters as the roads went under water. Our Pirojpur correspondent reported that nonstop rain caused the water levels of the Kacha, Baleshwar, Sandha, Pona, and Kaliganga rivers to go above the normal level. Our Jhalakathi correspondent reports: Many farmlands went under water and people of the low income group, particularly labourers and rickshaw pullers, were bearing the brunt of the inclement weather. Our Pabna correspondent said many roads in Shalgaria, Mujahid club, Mokhtab Bazar, Sahdupara, New Market, Chhatiani, Chakchhatiani,  Court Para, Radhanagar, Jugipara, Noorpour, Talbagan, Library Bazar and Anontabazar areas of the town went under knee-deep water. The inclement weather caused ferry service disruption at Paturia and Mawa and slowed down or halted traffic on highways. The BIWTA at 4:00pm yesterday suspended all launch services from Sadarghat until further notice. Urban planners have time and again pointed out that unplanned urbanisation would result in such an unbearable situation even during usual rain. They said powerful real estate developers had been allowed to indiscriminately fill the conservable water-retention ponds, canals, and flood plains in and around the capital. Rain water was supposed to be carried away instantly to those low-lying retention areas with a well-networked storm drainage system but unfortunately even the slope of the existing drainage system was improper, they added.  Extensive river foreshores around the capital have been filled up and encroached upon by land claimants with the government playing a silent role. As a result, it takes hours for rainwater to drain, making the lives of city dwellers miserable and causing damage to properties, including vehicles and roads, they said.  "

Sadar Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Israt Jahan Fatema said the union parishad chairmen confirmed that around 600 ducks have died due to the food crisis. Fatema said the government has prepared a list of the affected farmers to provide them with necessary support through the local administration. Wasim Mia of Lalpur village told this correspondent that he had 200 ducks, of which, 52 died last week for lack of food. Harun Mia, owner of 500 ducks, said the water birds are becoming weak and dying one after another as they are not getting enough food. He said the duck breeders would face loss if the government does not take necessary measures to overcome the crisis of feed for farm animals and fowl. District Deputy Director of the Department of Livestock Md Belal Hussain told this correspondent that he had informed the higher authorities about food crisis of the domestic birds. Divisional Deputy Director of the department Dr Gias Uddin Chowdhury said they have sent samples of the dead ducks to Sylhet Field Disease Investigation Laboratory to know the cause of the deaths of the water birds."

      "text": "Since the independence, people of Bangladesh sought many ways to become self-reliant. And the contribution of rural community behind Bangladesh's turning around has been supreme. As you all know, farming is the backbone of our economy, and as this sector stood on its ground firmly, Bangladesh has established its identity in the world map. The performance of the country in food security is way better than other countries around the world. After the independence, farmers have done tremendously well in paddy and jute cultivation; tried out diverse fruits and crops; fostered cattle and poultry. Most importantly, the youths have greatly contributed to the positive changes in the farming sector. They have spread all across the country with success. Many farmers have become millionaires. Bangladesh is also facing the wind of change of hi-tech farming. I'm sure we'll harvest the best results of the advanced farming very soon. Dear readers, I would like to share with you the story of mid 80s. During that time, the general farmers of the country used to nurture their cows, feeding them with natural food. These cattle were their wealth, ahead of the Qurbani bazaar. However, as the demand for meat increased tremendously in the country, the concept of beef fattening came along. I featured these changing scenarios on BTV's Mati O Manush. The then head of livestock department of Bangladesh Agricultural University, Dr Saad Ullah brought into the light Urea Molasses Block, a cow feed especially suitable during disasters like flood. This was a brick-shaped solid food, which the cows used to eat by licking. Four to five years later, came Urea Molasses Straw technology (a mixture of water, urea, molasses and straw). This was meant for rapid beef fattening. I would also like to share a funny story regarding the fattening issue. A young boy sent me a letter while I was broadcasting these fattening techniques on BTV's Mati O Manush. He wrote, \"If I eat urea, should I get healthier?\" I didn't reply to his letter; rather, went straight to his residence in Mirpur to tell his parents that they must be alert about their son so that he doesn't mistakenly do anything hazardous like this. I wanted to draw your attention just to share what some people thought about beef fattening in the country.        According to the Department of Livestock Services (DLS), there are now 5.5 lakh cattle farmers in the country. Altogether, they have 40 lakh cows eligible for sacrifice. The good thing is that consumers are now positively aware about cows' quality. Farmers, consumers and businessmen, all are now aware of the harmful effects of fattening cows by growing them with steroid or other harmful chemicals. In the last few years, driven by the desire to make huge profit, many farmers and businessmen faced great loss as a result of adopting unscrupulous ways. Many consumers can now identify cows which have been fed steroids. Those cows are more calm and quiet. You would notice saliva dripping from some of them continuously. As these characteristics give the message that the cows have been fed steroid, farmers are now more cautious. In the past three years, it was observed that many of the cows that didn't get sold over doubts of having steroid died after a few days. Due to chemicals, the extra water that gets stored in a cow's body turns into poison after a certain period, making it hard for the cow to stay alive. These things are now clear to the farmers concerned. This is a challenging matter to them as they are investing a lot in their farms. They are trying their best to fatten the cows by feeding pure, natural and organic food. Local production of cattle will be sufficient to meet the demand for sacrificial animals in Eid-ul-Azha this year, say livestock department officials.  I went to Gazipur's Konabari a few days back to see Subed Ali Agro Farm where cows are being raised with natural and local feed. There 200 cows are perfectly healthy and good-looking as farmers are cautious about how and what to feed, what are good for digestion etc. The owner of the farm, Haji Monsur Ali is a businessman. He has established this farm with a view to handing over healthy and beautiful cows to the customers on the occasion of Eid-ul-Azha. Monsur also gives 15 to 20 cows to his relatives for Qurbani. \"I have been extremely moved by farming. I also watched your programme on healthy beef fattening which has inspired me to come this far,\" says Monsur. Monsur Ali is involved with agriculture for a long time now. This huge farm is on two acres of land. Inside, the works are being done in separate sheds. Under one shed, I saw large cows. Under another, I saw younger ones. Under a different shed, every day foods for these cows are being prepared. Outside, green grass is being produced. Altogether, it is a thoroughly planned cattle farm. \"I not only give them good and healthy feed, but also bathe them with shampoo,\" says Monsur.  \"These cows cost me Tk 2 crore. Along with that, the cost of feed and treatment is there. I expect to make a profit of Tk 40 lakh from this Eid bazaar,\" says a confident Monsur Ali. This entrepreneur now spends most of his time in his farm although he has other businesses. He has a lovely bond with every animal in the farm. The officers of DLS are saying the same thing. Neither is any growth hormone given nor any other unscrupulous method applied. Rather, scientifically approved feed is being provided to these cows. Konabari Sub-Assistant Agriculture Officer (Livestock) Anisul Haque says, sixty percent of the feed is grains, the rest forty is grass, straw and water. DG of Livestock Department, Dr Ainul Haque says, every cattle farmer is listed and under their strict monitoring and suggestions.   Marketing the farm's cows is definitely a challenge. Even the consumers have many doubts regarding beef fattening. Monsur's son Shamim Ahmed, an MBA from UK, is involved in marketing and now looks after his father's farm. \"I'm looking forward to using social media to sell these cows in larger scale,\" says Shamim. Dear readers, flood seems to decrease the delight of Eid for half of the people of the nation. Bangladesh, as you know, is geographically a disaster prone country. So the country is always fighting against different natural disasters throughout the year as you definitely are aware of the extreme impacts of climate change, that's changing nature and the fate of people in many negative ways. We have to take measures keeping in mind the disasters that can affect us in future. There should be long term plans to save farming sector. We have to invent new farming technologies which would save our crops, fruits, flora, cattle and fishery, above all, the farmers from disasters. A constructive change is most needed at present. We can't look lightly on the efforts of Monsur Ali and 5.5 lakh farmers like him who rear their cattle through organic beef fattening. If they count loss, the rural economy will be affected, so will be the country's financial system. Keeping Eid-ul-Azha ahead, beef fattening is a great profitable and promising business sector. A large part of unemployment can be eradicated by expanding this sector. Livestock sector can play an important role in the country's economy, I'm sure. Finally, I hope the farmers and people of Bangladesh and South Asian countries recover from the flood losses before the Eid. My heartfelt Eid greetings to all of them."

      "text": "Dhaka city, established by the Mughals on the banks of the Buriganga, is surrounded by six rivers like a garland. There are Balu and Sitalakhya on the eastern side, Turag and Buriganga on the western side, Tongi Khal to the north and Dhaleshwari to the south. Tongi Khal connects both Turag and Balu rivers. Dhaleshwari and Sitalakhya join the south of Narayanganj and flow into the Meghna River.  These rivers receive water from the Jamuna (Brahmaputra river) in the wet season, and in the dry season upper reaches of these rivers are slowly replenished by the release of groundwater into the rivers. The lower reaches of the rivers are also influenced by the tidal variations travelling upstream from the Bay of Bengal. In the monsoon season, the river levels reach around 6.5m MSL (mean sea level) and drop to about 2.5m MSL in the dry season (Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, Bangladesh Water Development Board). The maximum recorded level was around 8m MSL during the 1998 flood. Once upon a time, these rivers were the lifeblood of the city carrying people, culture, trade and commerce. If we imagine the rivers as arteries, then the internal khals are the veins of Dhaka. Since the 1970s, the capital city of a newly born nation began to expand rapidly. The population and businesses grew, and by the 1980s, the arteries and veins started to become blocked and polluted. By the 1990s, some efforts were made to stop the deteriorating condition of the rivers by declaring some of them as Ecologically Critical Areas.  However, nothing changed, and in fact, things got worse. The rivers and khals continued to be encroached upon, and more wastewater from houses and industrial units poured into the rivers without any treatment, with several major sources of pollution being outside the city area--in Ashulia, Savar, Tongi and Gazipur. And today, in 2017, what we have of Dhaka can at best be described as a sick patient. You could say that her arteries and veins were filled with cholesterol, and she has diabetes, jaundice and many other diseases. She needs to be in the ICU for dialysis. However, addressing the symptoms (treating the river water and preventing encroachment) can only be a short-term solution. We need to address Dhaka's underlying diseases to cure her properly. A megacity like Dhaka, home to around 15 million people and serving million others who come and go on a daily basis, requires proper infrastructure. Currently, there is only one sewage treatment plant--Pagla STP--which is not functioning at full capacity as the sewer system is faulty.  In 2012, Dhaka Wasa (DWASA) prepared a Sewerage Master Plan, which proposed a total of 11 STPs in and around the city. One of these is Dasherkandi STP, which will be built through Chinese funding and is expected to be operational by 2020. The other STPs are still in the conceptual or planning stage. These projects need to be fast-tracked and also the sewer network needs to be built urgently. Once these projects are implemented, the khals and rivers have a chance to recover. Industrial wastewater also needs to be treated through Effluent Treatment Plants.  Although some industries have built ETPs, they often do not operate the facilities fulltime. This practice needs to be carefully monitored. Also, more central ETPs are required in industrial estates. Finally, a massive, one-time river and khal cleaning project is required. The beds of these water bodies need to be dredged and the waste materials carefully disposed in specially built landfills. Then the waterfront areas around Dhaka can be utilised for recreation and public spaces. The khals and rivers can also be used for passenger transport around the city.  The drainage system of the city is also inadequate at the moment. The western part of the city is protected from river flooding by the Beribad (on the west) and DIT-Airport Road to the east. This part of the city suffers from flooding and water-logging due to heavy rainfall and drainage congestion.  Currently, there are only five pumping stations around the city: Goranchatbari (near Mirpur), Kallyanpur, Dholai Khal, Maniknagar (near Kamlapur) and Rampura. Temporary pumps are also used during the monsoon season to manage water-logging in localised areas adjacent to the flood embankments.  The eastern part of the city is still vulnerable to flooding caused by high water levels in Balu River. A flood embankment, with three pump stations, is currently being considered by Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). Also, a four-lane road and rail line are being considered on this embankment. If urban development in eastern Dhaka is not planned and controlled properly, there is a real risk that the area will experience regular water-logging. Recently, DWASA has also prepared a Drainage Master Plan, which identified priority projects to recover and restore key khals in and around the city. Once these projects are implemented, the water-logging problem of the city will be significantly reduced.  Another key infrastructure system of this megacity is the water supply facilities. There are only four water treatment plants (WTPs), in Saidabad, Chandnighat, Godnail and Shonakanda. Only the Saidabad WTP, producing 450 million litres per day (MLD), can be considered for its contributions to meeting the huge water demand of about 2,500 MLD. The remaining water supply comes from over 600 deep tubewells (DTWs) scattered around the city. This is probably the largest groundwater well field in the world. The water table continues to decline on an annual basis due to over-pumping in and around the city.  DWASA's Water Supply Master Plan envisages reducing the reliance on groundwater by building more surface WTPs. However, due to the polluted conditions of the peripheral rivers around Dhaka, water is being sourced from the Padma and Meghna rivers. This clearly means additional costs to transfer the treated water to Dhaka. Already, the work for a 450-MLD treatment plant in Jashaldia (Munshiganj District) and a 500-MLD plant in Rupganj (Narayanganj District) are under way. These are expected to be operational by 2020-25. Further expansion of Saidabad (Phase 3, 450-MLD) is being planned by DWASA. With the shift to river water, pollution control measures need to be urgently put in place. If we want to make Dhaka a more liveable city, both for us and our next generation, then we have to repair the damage caused to Dhaka's rivers. With strong political will supported by sound technical knowledge and public awareness, we can achieve this.

Mayaudon showed the interest as he paid a farewell call on Foreign Minister AH Mahmood Ali at his ministry yesterday. They also discussed migration and cooperation through \"Horizon 2020\" in the field of science and innovation. The EU Ambassador informed Mahmood Ali the readiness of the EU to extend support to the Bangladesh government in the post flood rehabilitation process. In reply, the foreign minister said the government was dealing with the relief works efficiently and would take up the rehabilitation process in the affected areas immediately after the floodwater disappeared. During the call on, Mayaudon thanked the minister for continuous support and cooperation during his tenure in Dhaka. He also praised the Bangladesh government for the infrastructural development that took place in Bangladesh in the last couple of years, making the life of millions comfortable and rescuing them from abject poverty. The foreign minister appreciated the outgoing EU ambassador's contribution in lifting Bangladesh-EU relations to a newer height and wished him good health and success in his new assignment in Kabul, Afghanistan.

      "text": "Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) officials declared Monday that United Commercial Bank (UCB) braches would not be selling tickets for the Sylhet leg of the 5th edition of the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) just days before the tournament begins on November 4, leaving thousands gathered at different branches of the bank in Sylhet empty-handed. In a press release on Saturday, the BCB had declared that sales of tickets would start on Tuesday at some booths in Sylhet and through some online portals via UCB, but at the very last moment it was announced that tickets would instead be sold at four additional booths at the Sylhet District Stadium. After receiving this information thousands of people began gathering at the Sylhet District Stadium from Monday and the queue was more than a kilometre long by the morning. Aminul Haque Chowdhury, regional head of UCB, said that the bank was supposed to sell tickets but the bank headquarters changed the decision and cancelled selling BPL tickets at the last moment. BCB sources said that the bank was planning to promote its mobile banking system but as there are very little users of UCash in Sylhet, Music Super Star, who won the ticket selling rights from the BCB, decided they themselves would handle ticket selling in booths. BPL governing council member secretary IH Mallick told The Daily Star yesterday: \"We sell 80 per cent of our tickets through booths while only 20 per cent are sold online and through banks.\" Supriyo Deb, one of the many who had lined up at the Sylhet District Stadium said: \"I was passing by the stadium last night [Monday night] and saw many people already gathering for tickets. So, I stopped and stood in line thinking that I may not get one later.\" There are 18,000 seats in Sylhet International Cricket Stadium, the venue for the first leg matches, and BCB franchises will sell enough for a sell-out crowd, Farhad Qureshi, BPL's Sylhet venue manager, said. BCB director Shafiul Alam Nadel told The Daily Star that Sylhet had very passionate sports fans and that they would try to satiate the people's needs accordingly, with the BCB selling 15,000 tickets in the booths. \"We are overwhelmed that thousands of people have gathered in the booths for tickets and we had to restrain the ticket franchises from selling more than one ticket to a single person,\" he said. The Sylhet International Cricket Stadium will mark its debut as a BPL venue with the introduction of local franchise Sylhet Sixers who take on the defending champions Dhaka Dynamites in the opening match.

During a visit to Handial, Dharmagasa, Chaikola, Char-Nabin, Somaj and Mirzapur villages in the upazila, this correspondent found 20 big fishing projects in the water body using fishing nets and bamboo enclosures for catching fish that threatened increase in fish production. Bamboo enclosures and nets have been set up illegally on a total of 25 acres of the beel in Dharmagasa bridge point. \"Fish trader Motaleb Miah established this project with permission from the local fishery office. We are expecting to catch at least 300 maunds of fish from this point by December, as production of fish has increased in Chalan Beel after the flood,\" Md Nazim Uddin, manager cum caretaker of the project, said. \"More than 20 big fishing projects have been set up illegally with nets and bamboo enclosures, hindering flow of water,\" said Md Mizanur Rahman, coordinator of Save Chalan Beel movement. \"Around 313 square-kilometre area of the beel in Chatmohar region has been occupied by influential people due to lack of administrative monitoring,\" Mizanur added. Upazila Fishery Officer Md Mahbubur Rahman, however, rejected the allegation of poor monitoring, saying that drives are continuing to remove the illegal structures from the water body. Asked about the permission for a fishing project in the water body, he said only genuine fishermen of the area are permitted to catch fish from 15 points (jalkar) of the beel, without halting the flow of water. When asked about Motaleb Miah's fishing project, he said a mobile court raided the place a few weeks ago and removed the structures, but the fish trader rebuilt them."

      "authors": "\nAFP, Cox's Bazar\n",
      "text": "The UN said 123,600 had crossed the border in the past 11 days from Myanmar's violence-wracked Rakhine state. Their arrival has raised fears of a fresh humanitarian disaster as already crowded camps in Bangladesh -- home to around 400,000 Rohingya refugees before the latest crisis -- struggle to cope with the influx. Many are sleeping in the open air and are in dire need of food and water after walking for days to reach safety, the UN's main coordinator in Bangladesh said in a report. \"As a result of flood-like arrivals of new refugees, a massive humanitarian crisis is unfolding here,\" said the prominent Bangladeshi rights campaigner Nur Khan Liton. \"People are staying in refugee camps, on the roads, school yards and under open sky. They are clearing forest to create new settlements. There is an acute crisis of water and food.\" The latest unrest broke out when a Rohingya militant group launched a series of coordinated ambushes on Myanmar security posts in response to what it said was a fresh crackdown. The Rohingya are seen as illegal immigrants in Myanmar and have suffered decades of persecution, according to rights groups. Unverifiable testimony from those who have fled has alleged tit-for-tat mass killings and villages being torched by the army, Buddhist mobs and Rohingya militants. In addition to the Rohingya, at least 11,000 Rakhine Buddhists and Hindus have fled arson and attacks by militants to camps inside Myanmar, according to the last government update. - Landmines - Bangladesh border officials say those fleeing are also facing the risk of landmines on the frontier between the two countries. On Tuesday, two Rohingya children were injured by an apparent landmine blast as they tried to flee unrest in Myanmar, border guard commander Manzurul Hasan Khan told AFP. \"They stepped onto some sort of explosives this morning and one of them lost his leg,\" Khan said. The incident came after a Rohingya woman had a leg blown off in the same area on Monday, raising fears that the border area had been deliberately mined. It is not known what caused the blast, which he said was well inside Myanmar territory, but Khan said he believed it was a landmine. All three have been taken to hospitals in Cox's Bazar, the nearest city to the border, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya -- a stateless Muslim minority in mainly Buddhist Myanmar -- have taken shelter in camps. Khan said many Rohingya were also entering Bangladesh with bullet wounds, although it was impossible to say how these were sustained as media access to the worst-hit parts of Myanmar's neighbouring Rakhine state is limited. Rakhine has been a crucible of religious violence since 2012, when riots erupted. Scores of Rohingya were killed and tens of thousands of people -- most of them from the Muslim minority -- were forced into displacement camps. But the current round of fighting, which broke out when Rohingya militants ambushed security installations, is the worst yet. Myanmar's army has said nearly 400 people have died in the fighting that ensued, including 370 Rohingya militants."

      "headline": "Review of Earthquake Contingency Plan of Dhaka City Corporation",
      "authors": null,
      "text": "Syed Matiul Ahsan, Deputy Director, Humanitarian Sector, Save the Children and Moderator    Bangladesh is a pioneer in disaster management. Standing Orders on Disaster (SOD) of 1996 paved the way of our disaster preparedness activities. Our disaster preparedness plans are mainly designed to tackle regular calamities such as flood, cyclone and so on. But another major threat looming over the city is earthquake for which we do not have adequate preparation. Notably, comprehensive disaster management programme (CDMP) prepared an earthquake contingency plan for undivided Dhaka city in 2010. Unfortunately the plan is yet to be implemented. In today's roundtable we will review the plan and discuss how to address its loopholes and operationalize the plan in the present context.     Dr. Akter Mahmud, General Secretary, Bangladesh Institute of planners\n In reviewing the Earthquake Contingency Plan(ECP) for Dhaka City Corporation it becomes clear that disaster management is a multidimensional and multi stakeholder undertaking and everyone needs to work together to make it successful. When we discuss earthquake, we refer to CDMP and the three scenarios presented in the document. It outlines the nature of damage in terms of number of buildings collapsed, casualties and debris it will leave behind. Impact wise, if we experience 7.5 magnitude earth quake stemmed from the Madhupur fault then statistically the number of buildings collapsed will be 72,000. If we experience a quake of 8.0 magnitude stemmed from plate boundary two then 45,000 buildings will collapse and if a 6.0 magnitude earthquake stems from underneath Dhaka city, 38000 buildings will collapse. Potential damage of different scenarios of earthquake has been described in the ECP through four levels.  A number of experts conclude that the contingency plan is just a guideline. The hope is that this discussion will help prepare for the quakes and its aftermath. CDMP contingency plan is divided into three levels, national level, city level and agency level. The 64-page contingency plan has dedicated its third chapter outlining the required tasks by Dhaka City Corporation. The related documents to this plan are the Local Government Plan, RAJUK Approval Process, Disaster Management Act 2012, Disaster Management Policy 2015 and SOD. However, the problematic part is the interviews that were collected from organizations that work with this issue is purely qualitative. What's missing is a quantitative assessment of the situation. A scale was developed in an effort to quantify the method after probing into different areas of the plan. The interviews also inquired about the knowledge level of respondents, completeness, and appropriateness of the plan, man power and equipment of the organizations in implementing the plan.  The document also recommends how to form groups at the different stages of the disaster for example, formation of operation response group, developing of urgency services, urban crisis planning group, developing functional health group, health nutrition group, iteration services and how mass media communication should respond to the disaster, utility services, route planning etc. These major tasks will each have preparedness, response and recovery phase where the aforementioned groups will operate. The document minutely details these tasks.  The other organizations are not familiar with the process and stating that the completeness of the plan is in question. However, a unified conclusion reached by all parties concerned is that we don't have enough manpower to tackle such calamities. Even DCC doesn't have enough manpower to address this issue. In terms of equipment the preparedness level is mediocre and the score is two. Training wise there's definitely room for improvement. But we're currently in the midst of training so there is hope. The government agencies partaking in the disaster management process has ensured that they are coordinating with other organizations. Organizations like REHAB and BIP has revealed that coordination can definitely be improved. The overall score of preparedness is fifty five which translates to each organization scoring 20 to 25 on average. To summarize we're less than fifty percent prepared in all the tasks. The final observation is that emergency operation center that is mentioned in ECP should be available and ready 24/7. Experts agree that this center was built for unified DC but now there should be separate centers for Dhaka North and Dhaka South. All relevant organizations should have their own ECP. There is a disaster resilience committee in the local government and some groups are formed by other organizations and some voluntary organizations have been formed. It would be effective if these organizations can meet regularly for knowledge transfer and training sessions. All the stakeholders should pay attention to capacity building of manpower.  Tariq Bin Yousuf, Superintending Engineer, Environment, Climate Change & Disaster Management Circle, Dhaka North City Corporation/Project Head, Urban Resilience, World Bank \n The name of the document might create confusion because when other agencies hear that its Dhaka City Corporation Contingency Plan, WASA and DPDC doesn't feel relevant. There's another contingency plan for Dhaka city which would've been more beneficial if it were reviewed. Regarding knowledge level of different organizations, other agencies are not cooperating since it's a DCC plan. In his experience interacting with different national and international NGOs working with disaster management, they're more active than government agencies. They're partnering with different agencies through MOUs.  However, earthquake disaster management is not yet a priority in terms of development perspective in Bangladesh. The Urban resilience project has four partners- Sylhet City Corporation, Fire Service and Civil Defense, DCCN and DCCS. There's another component of DDM and RAJUK. As part of preparedness and response all the zone offices have emergency warehouses. The first emergency operation center for earthquake will be established in DCCS. It is also a command and control center for fire service and civil defense. There will be one in Mirpur and the other one will be in Sylhet. One aspect of the plan is search and rescue and the other aspect is communication. VHF, UHF and UF and radio communication system is being procured. The process will be completed in the next three to four months.  Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief is creating urban volunteers. Capacity building will have to be addressed at organizational level. There should be a resource center in the Disaster Management Building. It will be called ERCC. There will be a national training center. At the field level, fire service and civil defense will provide the training in their own training centers. Local and international experts and consultants will provide these trainings. The training modules are constantly being improved. To work at the ward level ward councilors are being involved.  Kazi Hasiba Zahan, Urban Planner, Dhaka South City Corporation\n   The ECP for Dhaka city would be a better way to handle the issue instead of Dhaka City Corporation. The area of work needs to be identified depending on whether it's a metropolitan area. Different areas will have different kinds of involvement and approach. Within the next one year there will be an emergency operation center in Nagarbhaban. The city corporation have emergency response teams but other groups and teams can be improved.          Md. Mostak Hussain, Director, Humanitarian Sector, Save the Children\n The eleventh goal of sustainable development goals is sustainable cities and urban spaces will have to be implemented. The guidelines available at the moment is scattered and not integrate. The dialogues and roundtables need to influence policies on a national level. The first attempt will have to be undertaken by the government, NGOs will have a supporting role in the process. The organizations need exchange information about their capacity, resources and gaps.  The document must include instructions for public that will be written in simple language so that they can receive help in the time of need. It is also imperative that the document details civil military coordination and elects an area where the coordination center will be situated.       Dr. Khurshid Zabin Hossain Taufique, Director, Urban Development Directorate\n UDD works with all the urban areas outside of Dhaka to create a long term efficient usage of land. We're very happy to announce that Ministry of Disaster Management and relief has funded the project in coordination with CDMP which helped formulate disaster preparedness and response land usage guide in Mymensingh which is very close to Dauki fault. The possible magnitude of earthquake is 7.5 and its return period is 425 years. Almost half of the time has already passed. Based on scientific evidence, it's safe to say that Bangladesh will experience a major 7.5 or 8 magnitude earthquake in the next 150 years.  The contingency plan must have specific instructions on escape route, post disaster food supply, medical attention, disposal of dead bodies etc. We can use FEMA software to classify the buildings that are vulnerable. We have to continue retrofitting. Field medical attention is extremely important. We have to maintain the conduit lines and it has to be included in the map of the contingency plan. New buildings should be built to survive earthquakes. We can create red zones and provide the government with the information. We have listed one thousand buildings in Mymensingh and sent the information to the ministry of disaster management for review.  Lieutenant Colonel Raju Ahmed, PSC, AFWC, Joint Operation, Armed Forces Division\n According to SOD, armed forces is expected to do an annual drill. Since 2010 armed forces division has been maintaining the drill successfully. Disaster Response Exercise &Exchange (DREE) has been continuing since last year in partnership with Ministry of disaster management. A total of forty five organizations participated in this drill and a total of 1900 people had a chance to get involved in DREE.  The challenge is that not all organizations are aware of their roles in terms of preparedness and response. To ensure successful implementation of the contingency plan all organizations involved needs to aware of the specifics of their roles. Disaster Response Emergency Communication System (DRECS) is underway through the armed forces. Last year a web portal was created in DREE and in the process a coordination is necessary with Bureau of Statistics to verify data. AFD also has a comprehensive web portal which can assist in retrieving crucial information. But there are still concerns about how data collected from surveys will be verified before putting up on government websites.  Md. Ashraful Islam, Project Director, Detailed Area Plan (DAP), RAJUK\n Narayanganj and Gazipur City Corporation must be included in the contingency plan as these areas are rapidly urbanizing. The industrial belt is in Narayanganj. When they give land clearance we notice a big physical boundary is missing. DCCS shares a boundary with Narayanganj. Contingency plan will be most beneficial if prepared for greater Dhaka. Pre disaster action plans is more efficient in curtailing damage than post disaster management. RAJUK is basically approving all these architectural ruins. Engineers and Architects should supervise these building codes. BNBC should be vigilant about structural quality control and RAJUK should ensure making all buildings earthquake resilient. 90% of the 5000 cleared buildings are not following the safety code at the moment. RAJUK needs to mandate it as soon as possible.It can also be a separate authority. RAJUK can partner with the private sector to establish a monitoring system.    Engineer Ramiz Uddin Sarker, Executive Director, Dhaka Power Distribution Company Ltd.   \n   ECP must consider how to protect the power lines and supply networks during and after an earthquake. It should detail the rescue plan for chemical explosions resulting from a natural disaster. DPDC does not have any preparation in protecting power supply systems at the moment.            Abu Sadeque, Director, Housing & Building Research Institute\n ECP needs to be carried out in a participatory manner with contribution from all organizations. Strategic plan should be followed by action plan. All organizations involved should have their own contingency plan and must find a way to coordinate between themselves. National earthquake management plan will have two sections- risk reductions plan and response plan. \nECP must have a national umbrella plan which will include regional plans. Risk reduction should receive more importance to lessen the extent of damage.        Engineer Md. Kabir Ahmed Bhuiyan, President, The Institute of Engineers Bangladesh (IEB)\n The work that has been happening in terms earthquake preparedness and response in Bangladesh is mostly theoretical. It's helpful in identifying the problems and finding solutions but we need to work on capacity building. Post disaster health management should be handled by Ministry of health. We should make a database of the equipments of all the concerned departments that can be used for disaster response. If any equipment is not operational we need to fix them.            Md. Shariful Islam, Superintending Engineer, DESCO \n   The utility agencies need to come together for ECP. DESCO has the logistics and manpower but lacks in training.             Brigadier General Ali Ahmed Khan, Director General, Bangladesh Fire Service & Civil Defense \n Mitigation should be of utmost concern both structural and non- structural. Multiagency coordination is key in implementing ECP. Drills need to incorporate in all organizations involving every citizen in the country. Strategic planning needs to be translated into tactical plans. Roles need to be defined and transmitted at the field level. Once the action plan is tested on the ground, adjustments need to be made based on gaps and discrepancies.  The establishment of EOC (Emergency Operation Centre) is crucial in implementing contingency plan. The government should make it a policy to carry out a drill once a month for all organizations. Fire stations needs to be greater in number. Volunteer stations will help control the casualty in case fire service cannot reach the affected area on time. Old Dhaka can go through land adjustment plan which will significantly help risk management in terms of earthquake preparedness. Lastly, community training and volunteer training can save many lives during and after disaster. Satya Brata Saha, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Disaster Management & Relief\n ECP has guidelines on how to communicate with mass media in the face of earthquakes. Media will play a vital role in relaying information about disaster preparedness and response. Citizens should also be aware and do their part in terms of disaster preparedness and response. Bangladeshi people can rely on each other during a crisis. However, there should be a strict dead body management guideline during rescue based on our previous experiences. To achieve the goals in disaster management, government and other agencies need to determine the number of resources for effective implementation ECP and likewise plans. Resource forecasting can aid the process.\nNational Emergency operation Center (NDMC) is currently being set up. National Disaster Management Council in a meeting reached a decision about forming a committee that will regularly discuss contingency plan during cabinet secretary meetings in coordination with CDMP.  Another important step is to institutionalize volunteer preparedness and response teams and put a structure to it. If Fire Service and Civil Defense operates under Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief it will yield better results in confronting calamities. If that is not an option then the government should initiate the process of creating a separate rescue force for earthquakes alone.  Planner A.K.M Abul Kalam, President, Bangladesh Institute of Planners\n   Space management is key in disaster risk reduction in both urban and rural areas. When extending cities and towns, the plan should always pay attention to adequate physical space for disaster management. Any urban or rural development plan must include earthquake contingency plan by default. Institute of planners can open their workshops and knowledge transfer sessions to all other governmental and non-governmental organizations including the general public."

      "text": "Though a number of initiatives have been taken over the years to address Chittagong city's waterlogging problem, many of those have apparently gone down the drain due to a lack of coordinated efforts by the government bodies concerned. Town planners and experts made the observation while approached by The Daily Star in the wake of recent waterlogging crisis caused by the Friday's incessant downpour in the port city. Following the rainfall, many low-lying areas in the city went under knee-to-waist-deep water, causing immense sufferings to the city dwellers. Chittagong City Corporation (CCC) spent about Tk 292.89 crore since 2003-04 fiscal to address the problem, CCC sources said. In this regard, town planner Subhash Barua said, \"If money is spent in an unplanned way, it will bring no results.\"      There is no \"integrated action plan\" to mitigate the problem, he commented.       In addition, water bodies and open spaces are shrinking due to an \"unplanned development\"; as a result, rain water cannot recede, causing waterlogging, he said.    Subhash also underscored the need for dredging drains, canals, the Karnaphuli river on a regular basis. The city's canals and drains have to be recovered from the clutches of the grabbers, he added.   Engr Delwar Majumder, former chairman of the Institution of Engineers Bangladesh, Chittagong Centre, said Chittagong city's waterlogging problem is multi-dimensional. \"It is not possible on part of CCC alone to address the problem,\" he opined.  To him, in Chittagong, tidal water adds to rain water. Moreover, an onrush of water from upstream carries sand, which contributes to filling up the drains and canals. He said silt trap could be set up to hold back sand. To address waterlogging, tidal regulators and water retention points could be installed, he opined. Moreover, utility services, including gas, water and land lines, running through drains, have to be removed, which requires coordination from different concerned bodies, he said.    Taking into consideration the multi-dimensional nature of the problem, Engr Delwar said an \"integrated approach\" involving other concerned government bodies is needed under the leadership of the CCC mayor. Contacted, CCC Chief Engineer Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahamed said waterlogging is a longstanding issue, and they are trying their best to mitigate the city's waterlogging.  Bidyut Kumar Saha, executive engineer of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), Chittagong-1, said a project styled \"Flood control, drainage improvement and water-logging mitigation of Chittagong city\", involving about Tk 3,165.18 crore, awaits government approval. Waterlogging problem will significantly be checked if the proposed project, which is expected to be concluded in June 2021, is implemented, he said. "

      "text": "Bangladesh has made significant development gains since independence and made greater progress more rapidly in the last decade. Per capita income has increased manyfolds while the poverty rate has been reduced significantly, from nearly 60 percent in 1990 to 31.5 percent in 2010 and approximately 24.8 in 2015. Further, Bangladesh has demonstrated high degree of achievement in vast majority of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Bangladesh has been duly recognised globally for these achievements. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climate change For Bangladesh, the next fifteen years (2015-2030 periods) of development will be dominated by the serious commitment to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has taken this seriously and has set up an innovative mechanism of allocating different SGD targets to different ministries and agencies, and distributed roles, as principal, associates and supporting, to complete the tasks. The seventeen SDGs are all consistent with Bangladesh's sustainable development. The first eight SDGs are central to all the vision and planning exercises of Bangladesh, particularly the Seventh Five Year Plan (FYP7). These SDGs are: No Poverty (SDG 1); Zero Hunger (SDG 2); Good Health and Wellbeing (SDG 3); Quality Education (SDG 4); Gender Equality (SDG 5); Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6); Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8). SDG 13 has been for Climate Actions. The others are equally important, and achieving the first eight will enable people to harness the others more easily. But, one of the greatest threats to attain the above goals is the scourge the country faces from the increasing impacts of climate change, particularly mediated by climate induced disasters. A set of twelve well-identified complex and reinforcing impacts of climate change on Bangladesh are as follows: 1. Sea level rise 2. Cyclone (intensity and frequency) 3. Deeper penetration of saline water 4. Erratic rainfall 5. Flood (intensity and frequency) 6. Drought 7. River bank erosion 8. Health 9. Food security 10. Water security 11. Land slide in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) 12. Migration Global challenges and great convergence In the last decade, the science of climate change has become more robust. Policy prominence of climate change has increased rapidly, and entering the global and national policy discourse, are included in the early stages of national planning. In the last decades, the global economy was coming out of a recession, mainly in the advanced economies. Middle East was engaged in wars in Iraq, Libya and Syria resulting in huge human toll, misery and displacement. Europe was experiencing mass migration and also rises of ultra-right views. Brexit added to the political complexity. All these were further complicated by the rise of unconventional approaches to governance and challenges to the two party political paradigms in the politics of USA. Despite all these negative developments, there has been a major positive development globally. The year 2015 experienced a unique convergence of three important global processes following from the Earth Summit of 1992. These include: (1) The UN summit on SDGs at the 70th UN General Assembly resulting in universal agreement on 17 SDGs; (2) the UN high-level meeting on the Sendai Framework for integration of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) in sustainable development; and (3) the universal agreement on Paris Climate Conference known as COP 21 under the UNFCCC which its complement, SDG 13 on Climate Action. There is a huge scope for building synergies among the three processes and outcomes to strengthen the national policies and strategies on development. This would increase resilience to climate change and reduce risks from natural disasters and climate change impacts. These may have long term implications on international, regional and national policies of economic growth, social development and environmental conservation. For Bangladesh, the convergence of these three processes offers an ideal opportunity of meeting the development, environment, social and climate change challenges simultaneously. Climate change, disaster and development linkages\n Despite the convergence in global thinking and achievements in adopting the Paris Agreement on climate change (CC), Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and sustainable development (SD) agenda 2030, it is strongly felt that if urgent actions are not taken to address climate change, it will undermine most of the development gains, increase poverty and inequality in different regions of the world, particularly in Asia and Africa. Climate risk reduction is becoming central to the planning processes of Bangladesh.  This was reflected in the report of the World Economic and Social Survey, 2016 of the United Nations. The report says, 95 percent of the poor people living in the coastal areas of Bangladesh are experiencing the severe negative impacts of climate change that affect their agriculture, food security, water, sanitation, health, employment, income, houses, communication, infrastructure, habitat and livelihood. One of the top three reasons for failure in poverty alleviation globally is climate change. The report reiterates that the conditions of low-income people, who already face inequity, will worsen with impacts of climate change. Vulnerability and exposure to climate variability and extremes are closely linked to existing inequity and poverty. Restricted and differentiated access to physical, financial and social capitals, and unequal opportunity of access to government supports and services enhance vulnerability.  A total of 6,457 extreme weather related disasters occurred during 1995-2015, which claimed more than 600,000 lives across the world, mainly in the developing countries, and affected another 4.2 billion people. The climate variability and extremes affect women, children and elderly people disproportionately. Bangladesh is facing many of the negative impacts of climate change due to its location (in between the great Himalayas in the North and turbulent Bay of Bengal in the South) and geophysical conditions. The country and the people are facing high level of social vulnerability which is associated with high population, decreasing land, wide spread poverty, some weak policy, meeting the needs of institutional integration and lack of investment in science, and technological innovation. The country has to incur significant economic, social and development costs due to climate change impacts and natural disasters. The global average annual cost of climate disasters has increased because of climate change induced frequent and devastating floods, storms, droughts and heat waves. The economic loss and damage due to climate change has increased substantially recently due to inadequate adaptation actions, particularly in the developing world, where the climate change impacts are very high. The recent climate scenario by the UNEP suggests that tropical regions will be highly at risk of climate hazards which will not only eat-up the development gains, but will threaten the future potential of development in the South Asian region including Bangladesh. Bangladesh envisions being a middle income country by 2021 and an economically developed country by 2041. To meet these dreams we will need to address climate change impacts and adapt rapidly to the changes in climate patterns and consequent impacts on the economy, the climate vulnerable populations and ecosystems.     Growing poverty and inequity in the climate change world It is felt that the impacts of climate change, degradation of natural resources and the ecosystem, and structural inequity are locked in a vicious cycle. Vulnerability and exposure to climate variability and extremes are closely linked to existing inequity and poverty. Restricted and differentiated access to physical, financial and social capitals, and unequal opportunity of access to government supports and services enhance vulnerability. Uneven access to health services, education and employment (particularly of the poor, women and communities living in hard to reach areas) and perpetuation of discrimination under the existing institutional and cultural norms create social conditions for greater vulnerability. These are being again aggravated by climate change, natural disasters and other externality like market shocks in Bangladesh. Further, the areas and habitats of the poor and marginal communities are exposed to climate hazards and they are highly sensitive to the impacts and shocks. Thus the economic activities and livelihood of the poor living in both rural and urban settings (mainly in the slums and fringe areas) are severely affected by climate change and natural disasters. To address this, the government has increased their attention towards the poor and marginal groups through social safety nets in Bangladesh. These are again influenced by power-elite politics and poor governance resulting in sub-optimal outcomes.  Multiple shocks and displacement The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5, 2014) assessed the climate change impacts on ecosystems and livelihood of the people and showed how poverty, livelihood and inequity interact with climate change. The livelihood assets and options of the poor are directly affected by climate change induced impacts, such as floods, cyclones, salinity, water logging and droughts in Bangladesh. These are evident in coastal zone, floodplain, upland and in the hilly regions. The groups whose livelihood depend on climate sensitive natural resources like agriculture, fisheries, poultry, and forestry are severely exposed to climate change impacts. There are many efforts of government, local government agencies, NGOs and development partners for diversification and intensification of livelihoods of the poor and marginal communities, which are being affected by climate variability and natural disasters. Because of repeated shocks and emerging vulnerabilities, the achievements and outcomes of such initiatives are often limited. In extreme cases, some may turn into maladaptation by increasing further risks and vulnerability. People are then forced to migrate to cities, where they live in sub-human conditions in slums and socially vulnerable areas. Their lives are dominated by the paradigm of competition over limited resources for their living. The lives and livelihoods of the slum dwellers are again affected by flood, water logging, heat stress, cold wave and many social and political shocks in Bangladesh. The need to break this vicious cycle is crucial. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that addressing root causes of discrimination, deprivation and inequity, (which mainly lie in the society, culture and institutions) may build capacity of the poor and vulnerable community. This would enhance adaptation and build resilience of the community to address climate change in Bangladesh as well as in the developing world. This may also reduce displacement potential. Resilient development through adaptation and mitigation\n The government, people and other actors in Bangladesh are aware of the risk and vulnerability due to climate change which are affecting all the development and livelihood efforts in the country. People are coping with the adversity of climate change and taking measure for adaptation in agriculture, water, health, infrastructure, economy and their livelihood with limited resources, using their accumulated and increasing experiential knowledge. The government, NGOs and development agencies are supporting community adaptation and sectoral adaptation as well as disaster risk reduction activities. The government has prepared NAPA and BCCSAP, created climate change trust and climate change resilient funds, developed the climate change Fiscal Framework and initiated the Inclusive Budgeting and Financing for Climate Resilient Project. Over 400 projects of varying sizes are being implemented by the government departments, development agencies and communities to address climate change in the areas of adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk reduction in different climate affected zones. These are inadequate compared to the greater risks, vulnerability and adaptation needs of the community and sectoral development. But the adaptation and disaster responses are giving the basis for resilient building and sustainable development for local communities and regeneration of ecosystems. It has to be noted that the poor and vulnerable communities are using their initiatives, indigenous knowledge and social networks to confront many of the climate change impacts. Integration of Paris Agreement outcome and SDG 13 Paris Climate Agreement (2015) has provided a good basis for climate actions by all member states of the United Nations. The Paris Climate Conference and its universal outcome have saved the multilateral negotiation and decision process. This offers a framework, principles and a decision process. The conference has agreed on five-year pledge cycles for mitigation, adaptation, technology and finance. A new mechanism for mitigation called Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) was agreed in Paris although it was widely criticised as a non-binding treaty. Paris has also agreed to create a fund of USD 100 billion per year from 2020 for adaptation (at least 50 percent) and mitigation although it is felt inadequate compared to the huge need for adaptation. The government of Bangladesh has prepared a road map for implementation of NDC which has been already submitted in the COP 22, held in Marrakech in December 2016. The commitments of the Paris Agreement could be achieved through immediate and urgent actions in: i) integration of adaptation in national economic, social and sectoral development policies and strategies including in the Five Year and Annual Development Plans; ii) development and implementation of long term mitigation strategy; iii) allocation of finance; and iv) monitoring and measuring the outcomes climate actions. The SDGs formulation process has rightly included Goal 13 for taking urgent climate action, which will again influence positive outcomes for all the key goals. Conclusions and recommendation Let us remember that climate change is a reality. 2016 has been the warmest year in 250 thousand years. The decade 2005-2015 has been the warmest decade on record. Little changes in global temperature can initiate processes having increasing impacts on precipitation shift, changes in wind velocities resulting in extreme weather or climatic events. It is not necessarily the average value but often the extremes that have the highest impact on society and the ecosystem. The first objective to manage climate change was to mitigate or reduce greenhouse gases rapidly. The major industrialised countries have failed to do that. Hence the impacts are high and require massive adaptation actions. Climate change induced impacts generate extreme events resulting in huge adaptation needs. When society, groups or individuals are incapable of adapting, the load of loss and damages increases. This is being investigated and included in the Paris Agreement. When loss and damage is not adequately managed or addressed people and communities will be displaced, causing gradually massive migration needs. Human displacement and migration will result in social and geopolitical instability challenging the domains of peace. Hence it is in the best interest of all to mitigate rapidly and then enhance adaptation capacity and actions. Sustainable development of a nation or a society is the best response to climate change impacts. Following are the recommendations for immediate implementation in Bangladesh: 1. Localising SDGs: In order to ensure the highest level of participation and achieving the SDG objective of Leaving no one behind, it is vitally important to ensure that in developing SDG methodologies and solutions, the perceptions, experiences, innovation and creativity of local communities, local government tiers and agencies remain a most important focus. The variation in the ecosystems, local socio-economic responses and impacts of climate change must be incorporated in developing SDG solutions and strategies. Hence localising SDGs should be a central plank in achieving SDGs. 2. Integrating SDG and FYP7: Bangladesh should maximise its opportunities of integrating its Seventh Five Year Plan initiatives with SDG actions, particularly reducing disaster risks and potential climate change impacts. A process should be initiated to optimise these processes for best sustainable development outcomes. 3. Mainstreaming adaptation: Adaptation must be integrated in the development process, sectorally, regionally and by impact types and vulnerable regions or climate change hot spots and vulnerable populations. 4. Mitigation efforts: Bangladesh must address its mitigation activities which are inclusive and complementary to its own Sustainable Development Strategy and plans. Initiatives such as solar energy, improved stove, biogas plants, fertiliser efficiency, increasing efficiency in the power sector, enhancing air quality by stopping traditional brick fields and going for improved system, enhancing water use efficiency. 5. Loss and damage: Serious research efforts must be supported so that loss and damage issues can make progress in the global debate and Bangladesh can become a champion and leader in this aspect of climate change and lead the Paris Agreement Process. 6. Fund mobilisation and capacity building: It is unfortunate that in the Rio initiatives process Bangladesh has lost out in mobilising adequate and deserving international funding from both the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). We must make utmost efforts for effective mobilisation from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). For that we must mobilise appropriate government agencies, private sector, research institutes and climate change leaders with due support and collective national efforts. 7. Adaptation funds for local level: Utmost efforts must be taken to push all climate investment to the local levels through local government, NGOs, social and local communities. Significant adaptation funds - at least 50 percent - must be forwarded to the local level of investment in adaptation and must reach the most vulnerable. 8. Learning from vulnerable communities: All actors must focus to learn from vulnerable communities, affected population and ecosystems. Bangladeshi people have demonstrated many indigenous technologies and practices which reduce their risks and enhance coping strategies. The climate change planners, local scientists and NGOs must learn from these practices and incorporate the appropriate ones in the adaptation planning and the implementation process.

      "text": "Bangladesh Welding Electrodes, a private limited company listed with the stock market, has kept its business activities on a hiatus due to a severe cash crunch. For several months now, BD Welding's production has remained suspended after the company failed to open a letter of credit due to being a defaulter with Southeast Bank. The company has now decided to sell off its factory land in Chittagong to pay off Southeast Bank's loan amounting to more than Tk 30 crore, according to a disclosure posted on the Dhaka Stock Exchange website recently. The land was mortgaged to the bank. Steel giant BSRM, another listed company, will purchase the 2.49 acres of land for Tk 42 crore. BD Welding will pay Southeast Bank Tk 22.57 crore with the sale proceeds of the land, while the rest of the outstanding amount will be waived by the bank, according to the company. After paying off the bank loan, the rest of the sale proceeds will be used to shift its production facilities to Dhaka and restart business, said Rafiqul Islam, a director of BD Welding. The company will now purchase land in Dhamrai, Dhaka. Islam holds the directorial position on behalf of the Investment Corporation of Bangladesh, which accounts for 34.54 percent of BD Welding's stakes. He is also the general manager of ICB. BD Welding's financial crisis began with a flash flood that damaged its factory, according to Islam. \"The company could not perform well,\" said Mohammed Gofran, additional managing director of Southeast Bank. According to its financial statement, BD Welding incurred loss of Tk 3 crore in the nine months to March this year. Its earnings per share registered a loss of Tk 0.72 during the period. Until 2010, BD Welding was in the 'A' category of stocks and declared dividends of more than 10 percent. When it started announcing less than 10 percent dividend, it was downgraded to the 'B' category. In 2015 it was brought down to the 'Z' category as it stopped declaring dividends. Curiously, the company's share price has been on an upward trajectory for the last couple of weeks. It gained Tk 0.4 to close the week at Tk 16. BD Welding was listed on the stock market in 1999 with paid-up capital of Tk 42.92 crore. As of April, of the total shares, 65.39 percent are held by public, 31.01 percent by sponsor-directors, 2.88 percent by institutions and 0.72 percent by foreign nationals. Established in 1969, it was the first welding electrode manufacturer in the soil of the then East Pakistan, with its plant and machinery coming from Switzerland. The plant was taken over by the government in 1973 as abandoned property only for to be divested in 1984. AR Khan, former deputy secretary and founder chairman of BD Welding, purchased the factory by ending up as the highest bidder. Khan continued to run BD Welding as a private limited company until March 1997. In 1999, it entered the stock market through an initial public offering to raise fund to set up an industrial oxygen plant in Chittagong."

      "text": "Illegal sand lifting from the Padma is believed to be a reason behind the erosion of its banks and damage to the flood-protection embankment in some places of Rajshahi city and four upazilas in the district. However, the authorities concerned who are supposed to monitor and make daily reports are apparently turning a blind eye. All the eight sand traders, who got lease of 11 Balumahals (designated sand quarries) in the river in Rajshahi, are allegedly lifting sand from outside the designated sites during the night. According to the lease documents, the traders are not supposed to dredge at night. Unplanned and illegal dredging can disturb the natural balance of rivers, leading to dramatic and unforeseen changes such as increased erosion, according to environment activists. Even though there has been no step to stop the illegal sand lifting, the Water Development Board (WDB) is currently working on two projects -- involving Tk 355.17 crore -- to protect the worst-affected parts of the city embankment and affected areas in Poba, Godagari, Charghat and Bagha upazilas. One of the projects' aim is to repair 2.28km of a dam near Rajshahi Cadet College which lost 17 acres of its land to the river. The college authorities believed illegal sand lifting is to blame for the poor state of the embankment there. Talking to The Daily Star, Principal Col Md Habib Ullah said the WDB had begun implementing a Tk 87 crore project last year to protect the institution and other important establishments in the area. But the dredging continued, he said. WDB Chief Engineer Mohammad Ali said another Tk 267.17-crore project for saving 5km of the embankment from Bulonpur to Sonaikandi of the city would begin in the next dry season. Erosion is a natural river trend, he said, adding that dredging from beyond the sites selected by the authorities would definitely have some adverse impact on the river. Asked, he claimed that he was unaware of any violation of the rules by the sand traders who have got lease of Balumahals. This year, all the 11 Balumahals in the district were leased out to eight sand traders, who have direct links with ruling Awami League and its associate bodies, said district administration officials and locals. Azizul Alam Bentu, organising secretary of the Rajshahi City AL, has alone got lease of three Balumahals, 406 acres in the river, in Poba and Godagari upazilas. Contacted, Azizul said he coordinates sand trade in all the 11 Balumahals. He said they had dredged the river wherever it had strong currents so that silt could fill those up. One of Azizul's companions, Babar Ali, who is Horipur union Jubo League president, got the lease of the biggest Balumahal (3,142 acres) in the district, for Tk 75 lakh, according to the lease documents. City unit Swechchhasebak League Vice-president Anwar Hossain got 140 acres in Godagari. Other lease holders who got Balumahals below 100 acres are Rajshahi city ward-1 AL General Secretary Rajab Ali, Charghat Jubo League President Mahmudul Hasan, Rajshahi district Bangladesh Chhatra League General Secretary Merajul Islam, son of a former lawmaker Aktarruzzaman Rony and Charghat Municipality Ward unit AL General Secretary Ahsan Habib. Locals and some district administration officials said they did not hear about any drive against \"illegal\" sand lifting. During spot visits between October and November, The Daily Star correspondent saw two dredgers in operation in Tangon area that according to the lease deeds where not Balumahals. The areas from where sand was being lifted were close to the Balumahals leased out to Azizul. Azizul, however, denied having any knowledge of lifting sand outside the designate areas. Many houses, farmland and chars in at least 10 villages were washed away in strong currents over the years, said locals. During the 22-day ban on hilsa netting that ended on November 2, the dredging went on. Environmentalists say that such practices hamper the spawning of the fish. Contacted, Mohammad Salahuddin, additional deputy commissioner (revenue) of Rajshahi, said they hardly monitored the dredging activities after leasing out the Balumahals since \"no one filed any complaints\". Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers' Association (Bela) Chief Executive Syeda Rizwana Hasan said usually in Bangladesh, no environment assessment is done before leasing out Balumahals to traders. It is high time the authorities concerned took the matter seriously, she added."

      "text": "It's getting harder and harder to breathe--literally. Dhaka's air has become so unbreathable that it is almost impossible to pass the streets without noticing someone wearing a mask, trying to brave the triple whammy of construction dust, smoke from burning garbage and leaves, and vehicular emissions. That is why when in early November the Delhi government declared a public health emergency because of the toxic smog that enveloped the city, the news struck a chord with many Dhakaiites. Even though bad air is something we have to deal with all year round, the winter dry season--ironically the period of time Bangladeshis look most forward to--makes it all the more intolerable. Delhiites are not alone--we too have on our hands a public health emergency, make no mistake. Dhaka dwellers don't need official data to tell them just how suffocating and dangerous the air they are breathing in is. But for the sake of curiosity and for outsiders fortunate enough to have never experienced Dhaka's air, let's do some simple math to see where we stand in the context of global standards.  Particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is a primary indicator of air pollution. PM2.5 refers to fine particles that are a complex mixture of solid and liquid, and are so tiny that they can penetrate and lodge deep into the lungs--making it one of the most harmful kinds of air pollutants. Exposure to high levels of PM2.5 has serious health implications and drastically increases the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and lung cancer. So how does Dhaka fare when its PM2.5 levels are compared with those of the air quality guidelines put forth by the World Health Organization--which provide the basis for global standards? The recommended target of PM2.5 as per the \"WHO Air Quality Guidelines\" is an annual mean of 10 micrograms per cubic metre. In a report compiled by The Guardian early this year, where WHO data on PM2.5 has been disaggregated region by region, the PM2.5 level in Dhaka was revealed to be an annual mean of 90 micrograms per cubic metre--the second worst in Asia after Delhi. This is nine times WHO's recommended level of 10 micrograms per cubic metre. \"Pollution caused by brick kilns--the primary source of Dhaka's dirty air--is not simply a natural byproduct of urbanisation. It is also a result of the failure to implement the Brick Manufacturing and Brick Kilns Establishment (Control) Act which was passed in 2013 and came into effect the following year.  Dhaka residents need to take note. We can no longer ignore the smog hanging over the city thinking it's simply a harmless concomitant of open construction, industrial production, or the dry season. The first thing that one would typically lay the blame on is Dhaka's unplanned urbanisation--and that of course is irrefutable. But that doesn't tell the whole story behind Dhaka's filthy air. The fact is that air pollution in the city has exponentially grown worse because of a complete disregard for existing laws. A public notice by the Department of Environment (DoE) in December 2016 claimed that the majority of particulate pollutants come from brick kilns--a whopping 58 percent--while dust (18 percent), vehicular emissions (10 percent), and burning of biomass (eight percent) also contributed to deteriorating air quality.   The tale of the brick kiln industry gives a glimpse into the intricate and bleak picture behind Dhaka's air pollution. The brickfield cluster in northern Dhaka produces 2.1 billion bricks annually (around 14 percent of the country's brick production). Pollution caused by brick kilns--the primary source of Dhaka's dirty air--is not simply a natural byproduct of urbanisation. It is also a result of the failure to implement the Brick Manufacturing and Brick Kilns Establishment (Control) Act which was passed in 2013 and came into effect the following year. The Act, in an effort to bring brick establishments under control, gave them two years' time to switch to modern technology and relocate from certain areas such as in ECAs (ecologically critical areas) or within a kilometre from the boundaries of ECAs. The law also has a provision which makes it mandatory for all kilns to manufacture a minimum of 50 percent hollow bricks to discourage the use of fertile soil--the main ingredient for making bricks. But none of these things are actually enforced. One, the shift from \"fixed-chimney\", i.e. dirty technology, to cleaner, more efficient methods such as the \"zigzag\" does not come cheap. Two, brick kilns are typically located in lowlands that tend to flood during monsoons, which is why the dry season is when brick kilns get to work. The shift to modern technologies would require highlands to avoid the risk of flooding--and with the soaring price of land in Dhaka, this is simply not doable for many brick kiln owners. Without government incentives to move to cleaner technology, the hands of the brick-making industry are tied. This is just one of numerous cases in the country's history of weak environmental regulation. Similarly, laws related to the fitness of vehicles (as per the Motor Vehicle Ordinance 1983) which could go a long way in curbing air pollution are flouted openly in a city where the number of vehicles is going up every day. That pollution is wholly an inevitable consequence of urban development is a myth easy to buy into--urbanisation is only part of the story. This simplistic line of reasoning also absolves public authorities and industries of their responsibility to act in accordance with the law and serves to conceal the impunity with which they are degrading the environment--depriving citizens of their right to a public good such as clean air. So whether one looks at it as an environmental issue or a health crisis in the making, what it's not is a \"simple price to pay\" for urban development. There is no denying that the main culprit behind Dhaka reaching its boiling point today is unplanned urbanisation; but it is the utter failure to enforce the laws in place that will perhaps expedite our plunge into environmental doom.

      "text": "Intermittent showers since this morning disrupted the normal life in capital Dhaka and most parts of the country. Commuters in the capital suffered immensely as important city streets went under water in Old Dhaka, Mauchak, Malibagh, Shantinagar, Mirpur, Razarbagh and some other areas causing serious traffic congestion, said city dwellers. Witnesses said office goers and students suffered a lot due to water loggings at a good number of points. The situation turned worse in areas like Rampura, Chowdhurypara and Mauchak where roads construction work under different development projects were underway, said Laila, a commuter from Malibagh. Low-income people, especially the day labourers, suffered much as rain disrupted their normal pace of life. The condition might get worsen in the coming days as the Met office forecast said the rain might continue for the next two to three days. Abdur Rahman, an officer at the Met office, said the axis of monsoon trough runs through central part of Bangladesh. One of its associated troughs extends up to North Bay. The monsoon is active over Bangladesh and moderate over North Bay. Light to moderate rain/thunder showers accompanied by temporary gusty wind is likely to occur at most places over Khulna, Barisal, Chittagong, Sylhet, Dhaka, Mymensingh, Rangpur, and Rajshahi divisions with moderately heavy to very heavy falls at places over the country. The day and night temperatures may fall slightly over the country. Meanwhile, the torrential rain worsened the flood situation in the northern districts as water levels in joint rivers located between Bangladesh and India were persistently surging due to the onrush of water from the upstream hilly areas for the past few days, said Abdur Rahman. Heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely to occur in northern parts of the country as well, he added."

      "text": "Mostafizur Rahman, administrator of Razarampur union parishad in Dinajpur, seemed unhappy with the size of allocation of relief materials for the flood-hit people in his union. He got only two tonnes of rice and Tk 8,000 till Wednesday for 5,000 affected families in the union. \"What do I do with this? It's nothing against the huge demand,\" he said, adding that each family would get just 400 grams of rice and Tk 1.60. In Dinajpur, 485 tonnes of rice and Tk 16 lakh have been distributed among 114,491 flood-hit families in nine upazilas, according to an estimate by the district administration. This means each family got only 4.23 kgs of rice and Tk 13.97. Mokhlesur Rahman, relief and rehabilitation officer in the district, said his office distributed 447 tonnes of rice in four days till August 17. However, visiting different affected villages in Biral and Kaharol upazilas, our correspondent found that most of the flood-hit people didn't get government relief till Thursday. \"We need relief immediately to feed our children\", said Motaleb, a flood victim in Chokchokha village. Around 200 families in the village got only two kgs of rice each yesterday. The picture was almost similar in other flood-hit districts including Tangail, Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Nilphamari and Sirajganj. Scores of people were seen waiting in long queues for relief in many of the affected areas yesterday. Contacted, Iftekharul Islam, director (relief) at the Department of Disaster Management, said, \"We have been distributing relief materials in flood-hit districts since August 13. Most of the relief materials and money have been distributed.\" In reply to a query, he said they were making the allocations primarily as per the demand from district administration. The Tangail district administration said it got an allocation of only 15 tonnes of rice and Tk 2.5 lakh for 114,290 affected families. Moniruzzaman Monir, chairman of Gabsara union parishad in badly-affected Bhuapur upazila, said \"My entire union is hit hard by flood and at least 42,000 people are affected. But I have got an allocation of only two tonnes of rice.\" Ayub Molla, chairman of Arjuna union in the upazila, said he received only two tonnes of rice for the flood-hit people in his union. \"I started distributing it on Friday... the affected people immediately need dry food as they have no space to cook. They are also in urgent need of water purification tablets,\" he added. In Lalmonirhat, 102,750 families have been affected in five upazilas. But only 242 tonnes of rice and Tk 8.75 lakh were allocated for the district. Of the families, 24,200 got relief while the rest are yet to receive any government aid, according to sources in the district administration. \"We need two kgs of rice for our five-member family every day. But now we have to survive with one kg or less,\" said 42-year-old Nurjahan Begum at a temporary shelter near Lalmonirhat-Phulbari road. \"We don't have any money to buy food... We got only two packets of khichri from an NGO but nothing from the government,\" said her husband Kafil Uddin. In Kurigram, the district administration distributed 851 tonnes of rice and Tk 230,500 among 117,302 families till Thursday. This means each family got 7.25 kgs of rice and Tk 19.56. The picture was similar in Sirajganj. The authorities distributed 547 tonnes of rice and Tk 14.40 lakh among 92,394 families in 391 villages with each family getting 5.9 kgs of rice and Tk 15.58. In Nilphamari, 236 tonnes of rice and Tk 10 lakh were distributed among 42,000 families, meaning each family got 5.36 kgs of rice and Tk 23.80. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre said the overall flood situation in country is improving. The water level in the Brahmaputra and the Jamuna was falling, it said yesterday.  However, more areas in Madaripur were inundated as the Padma was flowing above the danger mark.

The UN's refugee agency estimates there are an unprecedented 65.5 million refugees in the world today, split between urban centres or informal settlements, and more formal camps. Here are some of the largest of these camps, based on UN figures. BIDIBIDI, UGANDA: 285,000 \nThis vast settlement in far northern Uganda has sprung up over the past year as people flood out of South Sudan, fleeing civil war and severe food shortages.\nA village in the Yumbe district on the South Sudan border, Bidibidi became a refugee settlement in August 2016 and now hosts nearly 285,000 people, according to figures from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  DADAAB, KENYA: 239,500 \nThe sprawling Dadaab complex 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Kenya's border with Somalia has housed Somali refugees for around 26 years.\nThere were about 239,500 people in Dadaab at the end of September, according to UN figures. The population peaked at around 485,000 in 2012 following a new influx after famine in Somalia.  KAKUMA, KENYA: 185,000\nThis camp on the outskirts of the town of the same name in northwestern Kenya was established in 1992 following the arrival of thousands of people fleeing from southern Sudan during the 1983-2005 war.\nMany were young boys who risked being forced into combat. The camp also took in some of the hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians who fled around the fall of the military government in 1991.  NYARUGUSU, TANZANIA: 139,630\nJust 37 kilometres from the border with Burundi, this camp was opened in November 1996 to host people fleeing conflict in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.\nTens of thousands of Burundians arrived in 2015 when their country plunged into crisis after President Pierre Nkurunziza sought a fiercely contested third term.  ZATAARI, JORDAN: 80,140\nAbout 5.2 million Syrians have left their country since conflict erupted in 2011, the largest migration in the world today. About 20 percent of those in Jordan are in camps, the largest of which is Zataari with about 80,140 people, according to figures for August. \n "

      "text": "Inadequate storm-water drainage system managed by seven different authorities with little coordination among themselves is the reason why Dhaka streets suffer deluge every time there is moderate rain. The authorities do their job haphazardly. They hardly know what the others are doing, say officials concerned. In a well-managed network of storm drainage system, rainwater instantly runs into the low-lying retention areas. But, it takes hours for rainwater runoff if the network is faulty or destroyed, leading to immense public sufferings. The worst-affected areas in the capital include Shantinagar, Khilgaon, Bashabo, Malibagh, Shantibagh, Rajarbagh, Mugda, Mohammadpur, Badda and different parts of Old Dhaka, say the officials and urban planners. Each of the seven authorities \"looks after the network under its jurisdiction\" and none of them is assigned to do the job single-handedly, said Taqsem A Khan, managing director of Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Wasa). The six other authorities are the two city corporations, Water Development Board, Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk), Cantonment Board and large private housing developers like Bashundhara, he said. \"Dhaka Wasa with 370km storm drainage pipelines covers only one-fifth its service area of 400sqkm.\" The two city corporations maintain over 2,000km of feeder drains (open and small diameter pipes) to carry rainwater, and liquid waste from homes into canals and wider diameter storm sewer system, according to Sirajul Islam, chief town planner of Dhaka South City Corporation. While Bashundhara residential area's storm drainage is managed by the private developer itself, three organisations -- Rajuk, Wasa and the city corporation -- have developed the drainage facility in Uttara Model Town area. The storm-water drainage management of the Dhaka-Narayanganj-Demra (DND) and the cantonment areas are being looked after by the Bangladesh Water Development Board and the Cantonment Board respectively. Khilkhet has no formal drainage facility. It is mainly dependent on the local canals and other water bodies for rainwater runoff. However, two canals -- each at least 100 feet wide -- have to be dug along the 300-foot road there as many of the water bodies had already been filled up, Wasa MD Taqsem said. Wasa covers some 400 square kilometres area of the capital. But some 350skms of the surface is paved, preventing the ground from soaking up rainwater, he said. He also said rainwater would have gone under the ground naturally, instead of flooding the city streets, had 50 percent of the surface been open earth. Again, the rainwater could easily flow into the canals and ponds if they had not been filled up. The city's natural drainage system -- comprised of a network of 65 canals and four rivers, numerous water retention areas (ponds, ditches), extensive low-lying areas and flood flow zones --- is consistently being destroyed in the name of development. The low-lying wetlands and flood flow zones earmarked in the DAP (detailed area plan) no longer exist as those were filled up, in many cases with official approval, according to officials concerned. With its current capacity, Wasa's system can drain 45 cubic metres of water per second from the capital. But, it cannot do that as ways for rainwater receding are obstructed, says the Wasa MD. According to officials concerned, rainfall above 40mm in Dhaka would take at least three hours to recede, as the available pumping facility is capable of draining only 20mm of rainfall. Wasa says that most of the 26 canals that still exist are clogged with solid waste. Ten kilometres of canals have been turned into concrete box culverts to build roads over them, reducing their capacity to absorb rainwater. Taqsem said the embankments cordoning off the Dhaka city -- meant for flood management -- have also become \"counterproductive\" for the urban storm water disposal and that it required artificial pumping at the cost of public money. So, setting adequate storm drainage pipes and enhancing the pumping capacity could be a way out, he said. Surrounded by four rivers, Dhaka was supposed to remain a delta with extensive wetlands all around, show planning documents like Flood Action Plan and the DAP.  According to the plans, the city should have conserved 5,523 acres of water retention area, 20,093 acres of canals and rivers and 74,598 acres of flood flow zones.  Only 20 percent of the total sewage is taken to the Pagla Treatment Plant through sewer lines and most of the rest is just released into the storm drains, posing serious threat to public health.  The Wasa MD also said five more plants would be built by 2025 so that all human wastes from the city were treated. Urban planners time and again warned of grim consequences if the flood plains and the wetlands continue to be destroyed for \"mindless commercial gains\". However, nobody seems to be paying any heed to the warning. The real estate developers are being allowed to indiscriminately fill up canals, ponds and other water bodies in and around the city, they said. On the other hand, natural low-lying wetlands, flood flow zones, storm water retention ponds, ditches and canals have all been ravaged and filled up blocking the natural passage of rain.  Canals, rivers and water retention areas collect, carry and retain rainwater and are connected to each other as a drainage network. But in recent decades, the city canals have been grabbed. Open space and water bodies help evaporate a third of the rainwater, percolate another third while leaving the rest to run down to retention areas. Since DAP gazette notification in mid-2010, nearly all of the conservable wetlands have been filled up -- some with silent approbation and some with formal government approval, said official sources."

Erosion of the banks of Teesta and Dharla has taken a serious turn as the floodwater engulfed fresh areas in four upazilas of Lalmonirhat in the last few days. Lalmonirhat Water Development Board (WDB) sources said at least 250 families have been rendered homeless while 20 fruit orchards and over 300 bighas of arable lands were devoured by the two rivers in 13 villages of four upazilas till Sunday. Several hundred families in Sadar, Aditmari, Hatibandha and Patgram upazilas have taken shelter on government roads due to the severe erosion. Idris Ali, chairman of Kulaghat Union Parishad (UP) in Sadar upazila, said the affected people of four villages in his union have taken shelter on government roads after losing their homesteads, arable lands and fruit orchards. \"About 40 metres of the flood control embankment have been badly affected by the erosion, causing serious sufferings to the people of Dharla river basin villages,\" said Idris, adding, \"Officials of WDB are working to repair the damaged embankment.\" Sixty-eight-year-old Chhayamon Bewa of Shiberkuti village in Sadar upazila said she along with her four daughters have taken shelter on a government road after her homestead was eroded by the Dharla on Saturday morning. \"Our two bighas of arable land and a bamboo cluster on additional two bighas went into the womb of Dharla,\" she added. Sub-Divisional Engineer Mohammad Al-Mamun of Lalmonirhat WDB said officials are working to check the erosion at six most vulnerable points. Onrush of water from upstream and increasing water level in the Jamuna hit three unions in Bhuapur upazila of Tangail. Nearly 350 families of different villages under Arjuna, Gabsara and Govindasi unions have taken shelter on the nearby flood control embankments, locals said. Several hundred families have shifted their houses due to severe erosion by Jamuna. \"We have sent a list of 250 affected families to the district administration for their necessary support,\" said Bhuapur Upazila Chairman Abdul Halim. \"A Tk 291 crore project  has been submitted to the Planning Commission to save the area from erosion permanently,\" said Executive Engineer Shajahan Siraj of Tangail WDB. Our Lalmonirhat and Tangail correspondents contributed to the report. "

      "authors": "\nStaff Correspondent \n",
      "text": "It is losing one percent (around Tk 20,000 crore) of the gross domestic product every year due to air pollution, according to the study.   The country's GDP stands at nearly Tk 20.88 trillion as per the latest data of Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. Titled \"Bangladesh Country Environment Analysis 2017\", the study found people living in the urban areas are inhaling extremely unhealthy air. They are also exposed to lead, arsenic, cadmium, pesticide and sulphur dioxide from different sources. Air in the capital and its nearby Gazipur and Narayanganj cities remains highly polluted for several months in a year.  It gets worst in February and March, showed a presentation on the findings during a workshop at a city hotel yesterday. The brick kilns are the biggest polluter of air. They contribute 38 percent micro-pollutants while motor vehicles are responsible for 19 percent, road dust 18, solid dust nine and metal smelters seven percent. Another major problem is lead. Nearly 600,000 people living in 59 hotspots in Dhaka and its adjacent areas are exposed to lead contamination.  The study identified 20 battery recycling areas, 23 lead smelting hotspots and four multiple industries and industrial estates as the main sources of lead-induced pollution. Lead can cause neurological damage, especially among children, at any detectable level, it said, noting that mean blood lead levels are at 14-15ug/dl in Dhaka's industrial areas. The report also found that just to produce one tonne of fabrics, the dyeing and finishing factories discharge 200 tonnes of wastewater into rivers leading to health hazards in the capital's poorer neighbourhoods. There are a total of 719 such washing, dyeing and finishing factories in and around Dhaka, it mentioned.  The cities also suffer from waterlogging due to heavy rainfall. They are vulnerable to flood because of wetland encroachments and lack of waste management. On October 22 this year, just 233mm of rainfall inundated 60 percent area under the Detailed Area Plan (DAP) of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) and 27 percent of developed areas. It is not only the case of the capital. For example, Pabna, which has lost nearly half of its wetlands since 1990, faces prolonged waterlogging. The report, to be launched early next year, focused on four areas: cost of environmental degradation, urban wetlands, cleaner technologies and institutions. It recommended that the government should incorporate wetlands into urban planning and invest in waste management to improve the cities' resilience. The study also suggested enforcing environment policies and strengthening institutions. It said the government should provide incentives to industries to adopt green and clean technologies and enforce polluter's pay principle -- a practice that those who are responsible for pollution should bear the costs of managing it.   As Bangladesh is rapidly urbanising, the report suggests that the country needs to manage the urbanisation and industrialisation process in an environmentally sustainable way. \"When growth comes at the cost of environment, it cannot sustain. The good news is that we have seen it is possible to grow cleaner and greener without growing slower,\" said Zahid Hussain, World Bank's acting country director for Bangladesh. \"Bangladesh must plan and act now to prevent environmental degradation and ensure climate resilience.\" Anwar Hossain Manju, minister for environment and forests, was present on the occasion as the chief guest. Many other policy makers, government officials, environmentalists, urban planners, and civil society representatives attended the programme and discussed the findings of the report."

Water Development Board (WDB) officials said about 70 metre of the under construction embankment was eroded at Khogener Ghat point in the upazila headquarters due to the onrush of water coming from upstream. Sources said Tangail WDB started the construction work of the embankment from Nagorpur upazila in Tangail to Sirajganj's Chowhali upazila at a cost of Tk 109 crore in November 2014 and is scheduled to be completed in April 2018. Liakat Ali, vice-chairman of Chowhali upazila parishad, said Khogener Ghat is most vulnerable considering the depth of the river. Liakat, however, blamed use of low quality material in constructing the embankment at such an important point, which may cause massive erosion in the area in future. Refuting the allegation of substandard work, Tangail Divisional Executive Engineer Sajahan Siraj of WDB said there is nothing wrong in the construction of the embankment, adding that such erosion often occurs due to onrush of water. \"There is nothing to worry as WDB workers have immediately dumped GO bags to protect the eroded area from further erosion\", added the WDB engineer. Erosion by the Jamuna has damaged several important establishments in the upazila, including the UNO office, upazila parishad complex, police station and educational institutions.   "

      "text": "As Bangladesh is going for mega infrastructure projects worth billions of dollars, their management is becoming ever more important for ensuring the maximum benefit for Bangladesh, experts said yesterday.  They said most of the projects are complex, use modern technology, and involve complicated financial arrangements. But Bangladesh lacks expertise in each of these areas. The Daily Star and BSRM, the country's leading steel maker, jointly organised a roundtable on \"Infrastructural Development in Bangladesh\" at The Daily Star Centre in Dhaka. Prof Jamilur Reza Choudhury, vice-chancellor of University of Asia Pacific, said Bangladesh is progressing in terms of infrastructures. \"But perhaps the progress could have been faster and better-managed.\" He said there was weakness in implementation agencies. Many who have become project directors do not have the relevant educational qualifications. The professor recommended establishing a special cadre on project management. Project managers should be groomed to handle the mega projects and trained on contractual aspects, negotiation skills and financing, he said. They should be given training for a year or two so they can run the mega projects in the pipeline. Prof Jamilur said the culture of maintenance was lacking in Bangladesh.  He said he had had some opportunities to witness decision-making at the top level. \"Some of the major decisions are taken without much thought.\" Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, said infrastructure deficiency in Bangladesh was serious and widespread and cut across all sectors. He said Bangladesh needs to spend $20-30 billion a year on infrastructure development. Now it spends $8 billion. \"We have to get value for money. That is a major issue given the governance situation in Bangladesh,\" he said. Ahsan said Bangladesh was setting up the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant for $13 billion to generate $2,400 megawatts of electricity but the same amount of power could be generated for $2.5 billion or less. \"Why should we then go for this kind of investment?\" The railway on the Padma Bridge is a Tk 40,000-crore project, which is costlier than the bridge itself. \"How many trains need to run on the lines a day to make that investment worthwhile? Is there any analysis of that? No,\" said the economist. \"There is funding and let's go for it, that's not the way to go ... ,\" he said. Ahsan said it does not take long to get a country to pile up liabilities. \"I agree that we are in a good position and have fiscal space. But we can't squander money.\" \"I would say there is a nexus between the government and the business forces in the power sector,\" he said, adding that this nexus was causing inefficiency and was going to hurt the whole economy. Syed Afsor H Uddin, chief executive officer of the PPP Authority, said he recently attended the PPP Global Conference in Sydney and Bangladesh was highlighted there as one of the rising markets for public private partnership development projects. He said Bangladesh's debt to GDP ratio stands at about 27 percent, a rate that is envious for many countries. \"We have huge amount of fiscal headroom to increase infrastructure spending.\" Md Kabir Ahmed Bhuiyan, president of the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh, said decision-making process has to be decentralised. Renowned civil engineer M Shamim Bosunia said many infrastructure projects remain ineffective because of poor planning and lack of feasibility studies. The government has built several flyovers in the city but these are contributing very little to solving the unbearable traffic situation. Khan Mahmud Amanat, a professor of the civil engineering department of Buet, said tunnel blocks are being imported from China for the Karnaphuli tunnel project, which raised the project cost. These blocks can be easily produced in Bangladesh, he claimed. Toufiq M Seraj, managing director of Sheltech, said the government should immediately implement the Detailed Area Plan of Dhaka city.  M Firoze, head of marketing and product development of BSRM, said the government should develop railways and waterways sectors to reduce the pressure on roads. Md Abu Sadeque, director of the Housing & Building Research Institute, said the government should immediately finalise and publish the gazette of the Bangladesh National Building Code 2017. Otherwise, the country will not be able to solve the current chaotic situation in the construction sector. Prof AMM Safiullah, vice-chancellor of Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology, said Bangladesh has been neglecting the railways. Sujit Kumar Bala, professor of the Institute of Water and Disaster Management at Buet, said the country should pay attention to land utilisation. Mahfuz Anam, editor and publisher of The Daily Star, said infrastructure development is a must for Bangladesh to become a middle income and developed country. \"The interesting thing is that we are getting evidence that there is no hesitation on the part of the government about it. It is also clear from the spending of the government on infrastructure development.\" Salehuddin Ahmed, an adjunct faculty of Independent University Bangladesh, moderated the discussion. \n Mahfuz Anam, Editor and Publisher, The Daily Star\n For Bangladesh's dream of becoming a middle-income country by 2021 to materialise, infrastructure is a must. If you look at government investment in infrastructure in the ADP outlay starting from FY1977-78 till FY2017-18, you will see that there is clear emphasis on infrastructure-building. Bangladesh spends 2.8 percent of its GDP on infrastructure. Comparing this to neighbouring countries gives us a better picture about where we stand. India and Sri Lanka spend five percent; Vietnam spends ten percent; China spends nine percent. We seem to be spending a modest amount on infrastructure compared to these countries whereas per capita return on investment in infrastructure is higher. Globally, Bangladesh, according to the World Economic Forum, ranks 114th out of 138 countries in infrastructure competitiveness. We rank towards the bottom. I would like to emphasise again that future growth has to be accompanied by massive investment in infrastructure. If Bangladesh wants to spend five percent of its GDP, which is a commitment laid out in the Seventh Five Year Plan, on infrastructure development then our per year investment in infrastructure should be a minimum of USD 12 billion. Dhaka Chamber of Commerce estimated that by 2030 a total of USD 320 billion is required--nearly USD 25 billion a year, or 1.5 times the current year's budget, for infrastructure development. But Bangladesh is not suffering from a fund crisis. The government has increased its spending on development programmes by seven times in the last decade, and donors are showing interest in investing here. A total of USD 27.6 billion is available per year. The government also identified six mega projects soon after January 2014 elections. But so far implementation has been very slow. Questions also remain on quality spending. Per kilometre cost of road construction, for example, is extremely high. These are some of the greatest challenges we are facing when it comes to infrastructure-building. The media can play a great role in bringing forward these issues if we all work together.   \n Engr Md Kabir Ahmed Bhuiyan, President, Civil Engineering Divisional Committee, IEB\n Land acquisition eats up a bulk cost of our infrastructure projects. It also delays implementation. Therefore we should segregate land acquisition works from construction and run it simultaneously. Another major cause of delayed implementation is bureaucratic red tape. In our country, a simple construction project needs to be approved by the top level and it takes years to get the approval. Therefore we should decentralise the decision-making authority and empower local executing agencies to plan, develop and implement local projects. Bangladesh National Building Code has not been gazetted due to opposition from diploma engineers. They are demanding supervision authority for large infrastructures that are too complicated to be handed over to them. Our engineering education is in chaos. Many universities are selling engineering certificates but certificate-holders do not know the basics of construction engineering. Now it has become a challenge to ensure the quality of engineering education in Bangladesh. There should be some regulatory measures to control quality of our engineering education.   \n Professor Dr Shamim Z Bosunia, Ex-President, Institute of Engineers Bangladesh (IEB) \n It is clearly mentioned in SDG 16 that enforcement of law and order is crucial for sustainable development. This is also true for effective infrastructural development. For example, if you can't check overloading of vehicles you will not be able to ensure longevity of highways. We also need to strengthen supervision of construction projects. There should be parallel and independent review of government projects by experts. IEB should come forward in this regard. Many of our infrastructure projects remain ineffective due to poor planning and lack of feasibility studies. The government has built several flyovers in the city but these are contributing very little to solve our unbearable traffic situation.   \n Md Abu Sadeque, Director, Housing & Building Research Institute (HBRI)\n Bangladesh loses three percent of its GDP due to poor management of environment and ignoring sustainable solutions. Therefore we should always take into account the environmental costs of construction. We should promote the use of environment-friendly construction materials. We lose a large amount of our top soil in producing bricks. We can easily replace it with hollow concrete blocks which have high longevity and low maintenance cost. We also need to reduce dependency on import of construction raw materials by promoting use of indigenous raw materials and adopting alternative building technologies. HBRI has developed alternative technologies that can reduce use of stone by 50 percent. Mass dissemination of this technology will significantly reduce import of stone in Bangladesh. Similarly, there should be research on road construction materials. There is a road research laboratory in the country. Unfortunately, it is not very active in research. The government should immediately finalise and publish gazette of BNBC 2017. Without it we will not be able to solve the current chaotic situation of our construction sector. \n Dr Khan Mahmud Amanat, Professor, Civil Engineering Department, BUET\n If we can strictly enforce terms and conditions of the contract documents of construction projects, we can avoid delayed implementation and cost escalation. Therefore, we should involve legal experts from the beginning of any infrastructure project. Bangladesh now produces high quality rod and cement. We should promote use of local construction materials in our infrastructure projects. It will significantly reduce construction cost. In the Karnaphuli tunnel project tunnel blocks are being imported from China which has increased the cost of the project manifold. But these blocks can be easily produced in Bangladesh. Diploma engineers are demanding undue supervision authority. If the government accepts their demand in BNBC they will ask for similar authority in big infrastructure projects and that will be very dangerous for the country. Therefore, I would urge the government to gazette the BNBC 2017 immediately and without any alteration. Otherwise we might face many other Rana Plaza-like disasters in the future.   \n Dr Toufiq M. Seraj, Managing Director, Sheltech (Pvt) Ltd \n There is no integration among the infrastructure projects in Bangladesh. As we do not have any national urbanisation plan we are doing random construction works. Here, we first build housing facilities and then think about utility connection and communication infrastructures which should actually be the other way around. Therefore, the government should conduct rigorous studies on the development of various cities of the country, make concrete urbanisation plans, prioritise infrastructure projects and integrate all of them to ensure sustainable infrastructural development in the country. The government should immediately implement Detailed Area Plan of Dhaka city. It has been rotting in shelves for the last 15 years.    \n Dr AFM Saiful Amin, Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, BUET\n Investment in infrastructures should be based on national-level planning and need assessment. When infrastructure makes transformational impact on the lives of general people they will own it. It will create revenue for future maintenance of the infrastructure as well as construction of new infrastructures. Therefore, when we build infrastructure we should carefully consider the revenue generation aspect of it. We also need to ensure integrated development of our infrastructure projects.   \n Architect Md. Nafizur Rahman, Deputy Director, Sustainable & Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA), Ministry of Power, Energy & Mineral Resources\n With infrastructural development the demand of energy also increases. For example, when the construction of Padma Bridge is completed, many housing and industrial projects will be developed in the adjacent areas which will significantly increase demand for energy. We have to consider this issue seriously to fully realise the potential of infrastructural development. SREDA is currently working with Urban Development Directorate in Mymensingh, Mirsarai Economic Zone and Payra for renewable energy integration. Our plan is to create self-sustained energy source for the newly developed urban centres through introduction of renewable energy and waste to energy technologies. For this we need huge investment. The government has already formed Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Ltd in this regard. We should also tag private banks and investment organisations in this effort. With the support of JICA, SREDA is currently providing soft loans to industries at four percent interest to make their organisations energy efficient.   \n Dr Sujit Kumar Bala, Professor, Institute of Water & Flood Management (IWFM), BUET\n Over the years the Water Development Board has built a lot of infrastructure on water bodies, most of which is now dysfunctional. These projects have failed to achieve their goals and have high maintenance cost. They are now a burden on the government. This happened due to lack of integration in planning. The philosophy behind these projects was also faulty because the sustainability aspect was not considered during construction of these projects. We should learn from this failure and make our future projects green and integrated with nature. We need to instill the philosophy of living with nature in our infrastructure projects. Bangladesh is a riverine country. But we have always neglected water in our infrastructural development. Instead of developing our waterways we moved towards surface transportation. Our cities should have been built centred on water bodies. It would have made our communication system fast, efficient and sustainable. Most of the big cities of the world were built along coastal areas. We also have similar potential to develop our 710km-long coastal areas and harness the potential of blue economy. We can also address land scarcity by creating new lands in the Bay of Bengal through land and sediment management. These issues demand serious consideration for future infrastructural development of the country. Finally, we should ensure participation of people in the maintenance of our infrastructure.    \n Syed Afsor H. Uddin, CEO, PPP Authority\n Bangladesh has been in an excellent position to move towards big infrastructural development. The country enjoys steady growth, low debt-to-GDP ratio (26-27 percent), and has enough financial headroom to invest heavily in construction of infrastructure. To ensure adequate funds for infrastructure projects the government is focusing on increasing public investment, involving the private sector in infrastructure-financing and attracting donors and international financers. We have developed public-private partnership to include the private sector and banks in infrastructure projects. We are successfully implementing this model in the energy sector. Bangladesh should develop a national infrastructure plan and prioritise transformational infrastructure projects such as multimodal transit hubs, national expressway network, etc., which have a huge socio-economic impact. We should invest more at the planning stage of an infrastructure project.   \n M. Firoze, Head of Marketing and Product Development, BSRM\n In all the developed countries river routes and railways are used for bulk movement of goods. But we have neglected those options and opted for surface transportation system which is very costly. Here also we have failed to develop an integrated and efficient communication system. We had high hopes about the Dhaka-Chittagong four-lane highway. But within a year of construction it has started to crumble. Some spots of the highway have been damaged so badly that it requires capital repairing. We generally refer to overloaded vehicles for this damage. In our country overloading is not a new phenomenon and this highway is meant for transporting heavy loads. I wonder why we do not consider these given factors in our construction process. This clearly indicates a lack in planning, implementation and monitoring of infrastructure projects. We must come out of this haphazard situation. In Bangladesh land acquisition is a big problem. It eats up the bulk of any investment. The problem exacerbates when we do industrialisation in the wrong location. For example, we have developed our export-oriented garment industry in Gazipur which is very far from the port and the industry has to bear a huge cost, both in terms of money and time, to import raw materials and export finished products through the port. I must admire the government for taking the initiative to establish Economic Zone Authority in different suitable locations to address these problems. Under this initiative the government will provide land and all other utility services to the industries. Our infrastructure projects should be integrated with this plan. We should prioritise construction of infrastructure along the national growth corridor which includes the areas of Dhaka, Chittagong and Mymensingh. We should formulate zoning plans focusing on rivers as the hubs of industrial activities. In the construction of infrastructure we should follow the life-cycle cost approach which may increase initial cost but result in dramatically reduced operating and maintenance costs. Some rigid pavements have been built along Dhaka-Chittagong highway which has proven to be long-lasting and suitable for enduring heavy loads. This solution can be adopted in our national highways. Bangladesh should also go for elevated expressways which will ensure the best use of our scarce land.   \n Professor Dr A M M Safiullah, Vice Chancellor, Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology\n We have serious flaws in our thinking of infrastructural development. It is a widely recognised practice not to build flyovers within city areas. But we have done this and, most unfortunately, are continuing to do so. Due to lack of integrated planning a lot of the infrastructure remains dysfunctional. We must come out of it. We need to develop rapid mass transit system and underground metro to solve our traffic problem. Our neighbour Calcutta is successfully addressing its traffic problem. We should learn from them. We must revive our riverine and rail routes. Finally, we should always keep in mind that you have to obey and understand nature to control it.   \n Dr Ahsan H Mansur, Executive Director, Policy Research Institute\n Our current investment in infrastructure is three percent of GDP. But this ratio should be 10 percent which means we need to invest USD 20-30 billion in the infrastructure sector. But financing is not that big an issue here. Our major problem is ensuring value for money which means we are failing to prioritise high-yielding projects. For example, we are investing USD 13.5 billion for the construction of Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant which will yield 2400 MW power. We can produce the same amount of power by spending only USD 2.5 billion through other power generation technologies. We are enjoying a big financial space and it does not mean we can squander money because ultimately we have to pay the debt. If big investments do not bring adequate return we will face a similar situation as Sri Lanka which is now struggling to repay debts. Unless and until we bring dramatic changes to our railway administration we will not be able to improve the railway sector. Our railway system needs to be business-oriented. A big investment plan worth USD 25 billion is waiting in the pipeline but our inefficient rail service system is not capable of bringing return from this huge investment. The situation of our river-port administration is similarly awful. If we want to make our infrastructural investment meaningful we must improve our public service delivery system.   \n Dr Salehuddin Ahmed, Faculty, BRAC University and IUB & Moderator of the Session\n Along with development of hard infrastructure we should develop soft infrastructure which includes education, health, and so on. Without developing soft infrastructure we will not be able to improve planning and management of our hard infrastructure.       \n Professor Dr Jamilur Reza Choudhury, Vice Chancellor, University of Asia Pacific\n During the Partition East Bengal only had 600km of metal roads of which 80 percent was in Sylhet region alone. Over the years, Bangladesh has made tremendous development in infrastructure. But it could have been faster and in a better way. We need to improve our negotiation skills in operating government-to-government (G2G) projects. These projects should be verified and vetted by independent experts. We should create skilled manpower for project management. Most of our project directors do not have adequate expertise on the projects because they have to move from one project to another and they do not have adequate technical education to run complicated infrastructure projects. Therefore we should create a separate cadre in the BCS exam to recruit manpower so that they are groomed to be specialists in project management. We also need to ensure corruption-free management of big projects. In some cases the government takes loans to finance infrastructure projects at a high interest rate which may cause problems in debt-servicing in the future. Therefore all the infrastructure projects should have a revenue generation plan. There used to be a separate chapter on balance of payment in the project document which I do not see now. We have systematically neglected our riverine and rail routes which are more efficient than surface transportation system. We should revive these modes of transportation. Currently, the government is working on the construction of First Dhaka Elevator Express. There are some criticisms of the project. We have thoroughly studied the project. I think it will be effective as a temporary solution. Finally, the government should prevent undue political interference in implementation of infrastructure projects which often hampers operational efficiency of a project. "

Imran said 20-25 miscreants attacked them in front of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) around 5:00pm when they were walking towards Paribagh after holding a press briefing at Shahbagh. He said the miscreants threw bricks and assaulted the activists of the Mancha. They entered BSMMU premises to save themselves. \"A brick chip hit my head, but I was protected by them [Mancha activists],\" Imran told The Daily Star. \"I think the same people attacked me on the court premises and yesterday [Thursday].\" Earlier, on July 16, Imran came under attack while walking out of a Dhaka court after securing bail in a defamation case filed for his \"derogatory\" remarks about Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. On Thursday, 10-12 people, carrying sticks, scrap wood, and bricks, attacked Imran and his activists when they were holding a fund-raiser for the flood victims. Protesting the attack, the mancha organised a rally at Shahbagh at 4:00pm yesterday. As they sought permission from Shahbagh Police Station for the rally, its officer-in-charge, Abul Hasan, asked them to \"come through proper channels\", said Imran. The mancha submitted a letter to the office of Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner yesterday, and then submitted a \"received\" copy of the letter to Shahbagh Police Station. But as they went to Shahbagh to hold the rally around 4:00pm, the OC of Shahbagh police did not allow them, citing security reasons, he added. Imran then held a press briefing there instantly. When they were returning after the end of the briefing, they came under attack, he said. Over Thursday's attack, he said they filed a case with the police station on that night and handed over a mobile phone and a print photograph, which the attackers left while fleeing, yet none was arrested, he added. \"...rather police did not allow us to hold the rally. It seems that the government does not want us to work for the flood victims,\" Imran said. After yesterday's attack, Imran wrote on his verified Facebook wall: \"Was attacked again before PG hospital while returning from Shahbagh. They won't stop until gagging our voice. The message is clear: You can't speak up if you want to live in this country.\" Jafar Ali Biswas, officer in charge (investigation) of Shahbagh Police Station, said Gonojagorom Mancha men including Imran held a \"programme\" at Shahbagh, and when returning to Paribagh, \"some people\" threw \"guava\" at them. \"But none was injured...we could not identify the people who threw guava. We are looking into the matter.\" The Daily Star could not get a comment from the Shahbagh OC despite repeated attempts."

The way he narrates each of his picture stories reveals his familiarity with the subject and his deep-rooted compassion for their problems.  Despite his extremely busy schedule, Star Lifestyle is fortunate to be able to interview the eminent photographer with an enormous heart. Q. Please elaborate some of your work as a social \ndocumentary photographer and the humanitarian efforts. \nSince the beginning of my journey as a photographer, almost twenty years ago, I have been negotiating with myself to keep alive the passion of an artist.  Sometime later during my journey, I had a craving for more and thus began my involvement in people's welfare initiatives. I began by photographing and conveying my subjects' stories at first, amplifying their muted voices oppressed by the morbid social systems and poverty.  My aim has always been to support people whom I photograph. I want to bring the greatest possible changes into their lives.  Based on my intense desire to lend a hand, I have dedicated my second photography book 'Survivors', a 10-year long project, to the people who have been photographed in the book.  Twenty-five percent of the selling price of the book will go directly to help these 'survivors.'  In 2013, I founded my non-profit photo school 'First Light' (www.firstlightphotoschool.com).  All proceedings from the school activities go to giving free education to working children. Besides all these, I am continually trying to engage the general public with my different social activities through social media.  Q. When you are out and about on a project what subjects or things do you seek out? \nIn all of my projects I never show my camera first; I mix with people and I try to become one of them. I travel randomly, sometimes repeatedly to one single place only to familiarise myself with their stories. My main intent is to focus on people who are suffering perpetually and dying every day from their struggles.  Moreover, countries which are similar to ours portray the same scenarios. I think in every country all those who suffer are living the same lives. Whatever the culture is, the pain is the same.  I travel to cover all the hardships of their lives - of existences all around the world. Any human story which strengthens me is my project. I am on an endless journey following an infinite route, only to find a real world of humanity.  This thirst is eternal. I will keep walking, touching every face, through my lens. I will show the world - those unknown stories of suffering. If my single hand comes to give them shade, that will be the real honour for all my hard work and sweat. Q. What is rewarding about your work? What drives you?\nWhat I find most extraordinary about the work I do is that it opens my eyes to all the little pleasures of life. There is great pleasure in meeting people who are ignored by the world, in sharing a cup of tea with them, and discovering that they are still capable of affection. Q. Most of your pictures have a background story to narrate. Which one has been the most inspiring?\nThere was a sex worker who went through a forced abortion. She had to attend to a client the day she came back from hospital. When I visited her she told me, 'Akash bhai, I will meet my child in heaven! Do you think he will be able to recognise me?' That was seven years ago; the day when for the first time I started writing in my diary.  I started to note poignant stories of such miserable souls. I found these people are the world's best philosophers. I witnessed how beautifully they met with pain and from the ashes of unhappiness chose to rise again!  My emotional thirst and their stark realities shook many of my nights. The sister in the brothel always keeps sweets for me never wanting anything in return. The people, who never receive love, truly know how to love selflessly. Their laughter in the world's saddest place and their honesty in the most decisive place made it possible for me to do the emotional series.  I wanted to show the world, how beautiful some souls can be; how caring they can be in the world's most neglected places.  Q. As shown in your videos 'Give me some sunshine' and 'I love School' what was your motivation to document and help the people you came across?\nMy main motive is to touch people's heart through every event. It is not easy for me to distribute 1000 saris by going door to door, reaching thousands of elderly women. I did it only to encourage people and to take on my portion of social responsibility.  For years, I have been trying hard to encourage the extremely poor but talented students to continue their studies by ensuring their yearly scholarships.  All of these children are based in rural areas. Most of them never had any school bags; many of them cannot continue their studies because of the lack of books, copies, pens, pencils, erasers, pencil sharpeners, geometry boxes or calculators.  During the event 'I love School', many kind-hearted friends from my Facebook page came forward to stand beside me and gifted school bags and many other necessary items.  After ten days of travelling and distribution from door to door, the volunteers and I were able to gift 200 school bags amongst the very needy but talented students. We were able to make them feel that we care.  We care for their smiles, for their dreams and for their hopes. By documenting these events I want to encourage people to 'give' because we should always remember that, if we light a lamp for somebody, it will also brighten our own path. Q. Your subjects are mostly strong willed individuals; determined woman from a brothel, traumatised brain cancer patient yet unbending, man who lost everything in life yet holds on strongly to hope. What kind of message do you wish to capture and spread across from these portraits? \nDuring the last twenty years, every person I met had a story to tell. I try to capture the beauty of the people and their souls. Though the real circumstance of some of the people I portray may be quite grim; they are all strong individuals with remarkable characters. It is my duty as a photographer and an artist to point out every aspect of existence in society.  I must show what can be shown; going deep into every milieu and into every aspect of poverty, deprivation and hardship that I can encounter - because the only sin for a photographer is to turn his head and look away. Q. What do you think makes a great photo?\nUnless I can manifest the true feelings behind a photograph through my camera, any picture becomes meaningless. For me the main challenge is to convey the deepest meaning of a photograph to the viewer - so that it touches the heart. Q. How does photography in Bangladesh differ from any other country? Your subjects are mostly Bangladeshi, why are their stories more compelling?\nMy journey has always been more than the portrayal of people; I strive to reveal the varied and undeserved circumstances each of them face- battles that are fought in a large part, with little more than fleeting smiles. I have travelled to more than 50 countries, worked in numerous mainstream projects but still I feel our marginalised people in Bangladesh have the most moving stories to tell.  Q. Can you name some of your personal favourites in the field of photography?\nI very much admire Sebastiao Salgado. His work is a rich resource of inspiration. James Natchway is also one of the most inspiring photographers as well as an influential person for me. All of his works inspire me. This photographer portrays the wars of the world but delivers the message of peace.  Do you have any words of advice for people motivated by your work and hoping to venture in the same field? Do your own kind of photography and follow your own trail. As a photographer when you are able to discover yourself within your photographs, then you can finally consider yourself as successful. If you remain true to your work, then your work will always remain true to you. Interview taken by Mehrin Mubdi Chowdhury\n Stories and pictures collected from GMB Akash and printed without editing."

      "text": "Emphasising the necessity of ponds in mitigating waterlogging crisis and during fire incidents, urban experts and environmentalists demanded that the government take proper measures to protect these vital organs. A pond is also beneficial for the environment and enhances the aesthetic beauty of an area, they added. The experts stressed the need for recovering the reservoirs which have been grabbed illegally or left in death throes due to pollution. Also, a mass awareness is needed as the responsibility to protect these water bodies from encroachment and pollution lies with all. They also sought intervention of the prime minister in this regard. Emphasising the need for protecting ponds and water bodies, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a parliament session on July 13 said the government has prepared a wetland protection act to save those. She said during any construction work, the water bodies have to be kept intact. Prof Mujibur Rahman of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet) said a pond is a natural haven. It has an ecosystem where there are communities of organism dependent on each other with the prevailing water environment for their nutrients and survival. But people are destroying it by making it polluted, he said. \"A pond is vital for its rain water containing capacity. It also helps the drainage system. Unfortunately, people do not even realise it.\" The more these water bodies will be filled up, the more rainwater will keep on submerging the roads and houses. \"The value of land in Dhaka is so high that people (both government and private) do not want to keep the ponds alive. They want to build buildings or other structures by filling those up. It is unacceptable,\" he said. \"Destroying these vital organs means damaging the country's environment. Ponds are one of the major components of the environment.\" \"Not just the ponds, even the trees around the water bodies play an important role in solving the drainage problem of an area. With the help of the trees, vegetation can be generated by the banks of a reservoir. It can drain out a huge amount of rain water,\" he said. Architect Iqbal Habib, joint secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (Bapa), said ponds and water bodies are essential to put up resistance against warm weather. A water body has a higher heat capacity than land. It also comes in handy during incidents of fire. Importance and necessity of protecting the reservoirs are also mentioned in the Building Construction Rules and the capital's Detailed Area Plan, he said. \"The government has documented the necessity of the reservoirs but did not take any step to protect those. Even just from the viewpoint of disaster management and the Detailed Area Plan, recovering and protecting the existing ponds are a must,\" he said. If the government do not protect the water bodies, it will be a violation of law, said Habib. A coordinated initiative by the ministries concerned is imperative to protect the ponds. Also, steps should be taken against all illegal activities such as construction of the BGMEA Bhaban at Hatirjheel, he said. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela), said a pond has become a rare sight in the capital. \"All this generation sees are buildings and wetlands filled with sands. This must change.\" \"We can't deny the necessity of ponds in the heavily populated and congested Dhaka city. We must protect what we are still left with and excavate new ones to save the city from waterlogging,\" she added. Prof Ishrat Islam of department of Urban and Regional Planning of Buet said, \"The digging of ponds started in line with the 'dig-elevate-dwell' principle of settlement. This is the way people started living in the floodplains of a delta. As most of the area of Bangladesh is lowland, ponds were dug up for earth to elevate the land.\" The reservoirs also became a source of water and were used as retention areas. During the early days, city people used to depend on pond water for drinking, bathing or doing their household chores, she said. \"We also have a pond at our grandfather's house in Siddheshwari. It was purchased in 1948. There was a huge scarcity of water there and people of the area used to use its water.\" \"We are now far away from the concept of ponds as there is no necessity of pond for drinking water...,\" she said. \"Many of the city ponds were filled up due to dumping of waste.\" Prof Israt said in many countries they keep the water bodies intact as part of their flood or drainage management system. While developing an area, they are not allowed to fill those up randomly. The developers there will have to build playgrounds as well as keep certain areas as lakes or ponds or canals, she said. \"According to Building Construction Rules, cutting of hills and filling up ponds are not allowed without permission. But it went on unabated. The wetland protection act is supposed to protect every kind of water bodies. The authorities concerned will have to take strict measures in this regard.\" AKM Shakil Newaz, director (operation and maintenance) of Fire Service and Civil defence, said water saves lives from fire. \"We need reservoirs. Most of Dhaka's water bodies were filled up randomly for which we face an acute shortage of water during fire incidents,\" he said. \"During fire incidents, we do not get water like before. We have to have two systems of getting water. One will be the mechanical or modern system where we need to have fire hydrants, and the other will be the natural source of water such as ponds or other water bodies.\" Also, from an environmental aspect and to maintain the ecology, it is essential to have water bodies, Shakil said. \"Last year during a fire incident at Karwan Bazar, we had to face serious difficulties due to a lack of water body,\" he said. In Uttara, they also faced a similar problem while dousing a blaze, he added. \"We had to seek water door to door. If there was a pond available in the area, we could have fetched water from it and brought the situation under control sooner. Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) Mayor Annisul Huq in July said most of the water bodies are under the DC office while Wasa is in charge of the maintenance. \"I don't see that many ponds in the city anymore. The ponds and other water bodies are a vital part of Dhaka. Those have to be protected properly,\" he said. Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) Mayor Sayeed Khokon said most of the ponds in the DSCC area are privately owned or under the possession of panchayets (local associations). \"The ponds are managed locally. When people seek help, we assist them. If needed, we can do cleaning activities in the ponds,\" he said. About the Shikkatuli pond, the mayor said there is a dispute between locals and those who are claiming ownership of the pond. About the DIT plot pond in Genderia, the mayor said some influential people are trying to grab it. \"I have asked our people to clean the pond,\" he said. Rajuk will have to take an initiative to protect it. \"If Rajuk, DC office, individual owners or local associations seek help from the DSCC to protect the pond, we will be more than happy to help them. For example, there were no street lights near Bongshal pond. We have set up the lights around the reservoir, following requests of locals,\" the mayor said.   (Edited by HASAN MEER)\n   Mujibur Rahman, Professor\n Not just the ponds, even the trees around the water bodies play an important role in solving the drainage problem of an area.

      "text": "With beautiful landscape architecture, well-maintained roads, musical fountain, the water taxi service, and an amphitheatre, Hatirjheel project arguably has some of the best roads in Dhaka. But how do we keep it that way? We asked people of all walks of life about their hopes and expectations regarding the project. And hence we present you five things to do/avoid if you do not want to see Hatirjheel worsen over time.   Nusrat Tamanna, 22, is a BBA student at a private university. And like countless others of her age, she is also a foodie. But even though she loves trying out new restaurants and enjoys the culinary diversity the city's numerous eateries provide, she is reluctant to see Hatirjheel become a restaurant hub, with food joints mushrooming all over. \"There are a few restaurants already, which is fine,\" she said. \"However, if this number continues to rise indefinitely, the charm of this pristine place will be lost.\"    The water taxi service at Hatirjheel is a refreshing initiative. It is a brilliant alternative for many commuters like Ibrahim Ahmed, who is a salesperson at a shop in Karwan Bazar. Nowadays, he hops onto a water taxi from Gulshan-Badda Link Road and navigates through Hatirjheel to drop off near FDC Gate. \"There is no traffic jam, and I can enjoy picturesque views to and from office. These boats are safe too, with life jackets and all. And, unlike buses, the boats are not crammed with an overload of people,\" Ahmed pointed out. \"I wish these things do not change in the future.\" And he added, \"The authorities should be more careful about foul smell that sometimes comes from the water.\" Unlike those water taxis, buses in Dhaka are crammed, often drive recklessly, and have poor maintenance. But Hatirjheel's bus service is much better when compared with many others in Dhaka. However, Yusuf Ali, a young executive in a bank, thinks that the service can be improved.  He said, \"A lot of people have to stand, and sometimes the passengers have to nudge the driver to move forward instead of waiting for more,\" he complained. \"This culture has to be given up. We expect higher standard from Hatirjheel.\" Hatirjheel has earned a reputation of being a feat of engineering and a successful work of landscape architecture. Arshad Sharif, 55 years of age, regularly comes here in the morning for a jog. He thinks that Hatirjheel makes for a good start to the day. \"I do not want to get bombarded by billboards. I guess a few is all right. But the placement and size must not obstruct the beauty, serenity, and architecture,\" he pleaded. There are many bins on the sides of the roads of Hatirjheel. Using the trash can is one of the most basic responsibilities of citizens. But do we do so? Anisha Sattar, a homemaker and mother of two, shared her frustration. \"Hatirjheel is nowadays a popular spot for recreation. That is great. But I have seen so many times people littering the streets and the lake,\" she said. \"And I also want to add that people should not pluck flowers out of the roadside plants.\" Let's keep Hatirjheel clean and pristine the way it is today. Let's improve it further. At least, let's not spoil it!"

      "text": "Sugarcane farming in flood-prone sandy char lands along Teesta and Jamuna river basin is gaining popularity among farmers as those lands stay under water during the rainy season and fallow in the dry season. Many of the char lands have been brought under rabi crop farming during dry season using modern techniques of cultivation. Farmers of char lands are now growing maize, boro, kawn, chili and pumpkin during dry season. Farmers said sugarcane cultivation is more profitable than other crops as they spend less for pesticide and fertilizer and do not need to irrigate the land. Growers are getting profit of Tk 20,000 to Tk 25,000 per bigha farming sugarcane in barren sandy lands. Earlier, those lands would remain fallow. Sugarcane is a flood tolerant crop and can survive in stagnant water for a long time. Char people have been farming it for the last few years and getting more profit than from other crops, as a result more farmers are showing interest in sugarcane farming in char lands. \"Sugarcane farming in flood prone areas is profitable, as those lands are not suitable for other crops because of inundation for a long time,\" said Ramjan Ali of char Khatiyamari in Fulchhari upazila. \"We spend little for sugarcane farming and get handsome profit. We also sell the produce to sugar mills at Tk 110 per maund,\" said Amjad Ali, another cane grower. \"I have cultivated sugarcane on three bighas of land and expect a better yield than last year when I harvested 85 maunds from one bigha,\" said farmer Ismail Hossain. If the weather is good, a farmer can get 120 to 130 maunds of sugarcane per bigha using HYV variety of seeds, said Gobindaganj Upazila Agriculture Officer Sahara Banu. Managing Director of Rangpur Sugar Mills Abdul Awal said a large-scale sugarcane cultivation programme will be taken up to use the fallow char lands along Jamuna river basin for the longest possible time."

      "text": "The most common ailment that I witness in the OPD nowadays is the itchy ears with discharge. Patients usually come from all backgrounds and ages, male and female, complaining of an earache. They complain of earache, itching and also discharge from the ears. Upon after examining the patient, it is seen that they are suffering from some kind of ear infection, which can be of two types -- Otitis Externa and Otitis Media. Otitis Externa occurs in the outer canal of the ear. Rain water, flood waters, or just water from bathing in ponds may enter the ears. We have a bad habit of scratching our ears or just introducing things like cotton buds, clips or even the ends of clothes into our ears, which allows the entry of bacteria or fungus into the canal. Patients then will complain of pain, itchiness and discharge. Sometimes, there may be swelling and the pain may become intense and unbearable. The patient should definitely go and see a doctor at this stage. Otherwise, the infection may spread to the ear drum that can perforate it and cause hearing loss. After examining the ear, the doctor prescribes a local antibiotic and some other oral medication. Sometimes, if there is swelling, a pack soaked with antibiotics may be placed in the canal for 24 hours after cleaning, and removed later. If the ear drum is involved and perforated, the patient has to be careful about not getting water in the ears. The patient must use an ear plug during bathing or some cotton soaked with olive oil or coconut oil or simply petroleum jelly. You must remember that if there is repeated discharge from a perforated ear drum, then there will be hearing loss, which is irreversible. So keeping the ear dry is very important. Otomycosis -- also known as a fungal infection of the ear -- is also very common in this hot, humid weather. It is caused by an organism known as Aspergillus Niger and Candida Albicans. The symptoms are irritation, itchiness and a dull pain in the ear. Some patients also complain of a sense of blockage or heaviness of the ears and some discharge as well. The infection is usually caused by scratching the ear with damp cotton buds, clips or even nails that allow the entry of bacteria and fungus. The hot, humid environment is a very good breeding place for fungus and some bacteria. When the doctor examines the ear, there is the presence of fungal debris that looks like wet newspaper. This has to be thoroughly cleaned and an antifungal drop prescribed. If there is a superadded infection, oral antibiotics also have to be prescribed. If the infection is there for a long time, the ear drum may get perforated and so, extra care has to be taken to treat the ear. Otitis Media occurs in the middle ear.  If there is a perforated ear drum, and there is an entry of water into the ear, it goes directly to the middle ear as there is no drum to protect it. This water is dirty and contains bacteria, which in turn causes an infection in the ear. If the ear was dry before, due to the presence of bacteria, there is pus formation, and discharge from ears. The patient complains of earache and a discharging ear. The doctor, after examining the ear, will clean it and prescribe drops and oral meds. It is important to remember that there is a hearing loss due to this kind of an infection and if it becomes chronic, then there will be permanent hearing loss. If the patient is an elderly person with diabetes or any other immunocompromised condition, these infections seem to get more severe than usual and have to be treated faster. Sometimes, the patient may even need to be hospitalised. Whether the infection is bacterial or fungal, in the external ear or middle ear, keeping the ear dry is the most important advice besides taking appropriate medication. Repeated infection of the ear causes damage to the ear drum, which in turn causes hearing loss. The introduction of dirty objects like hair clips, cotton buds, pieces of cloth and nails should also be avoided. Hearing is a valuable function for our living and so, we should make sure we protect it as best as we can. Photo: Collected"

      "text": "Northern winters can be cold. At 67-years-old it would be understandable if Marium Begum, from Panchgachi Santiram village in Gaibandha's Sundarganj upazila, said she really feels it: not only the cold of the winter air but from long years of struggle. Twenty years ago her husband abandoned her, to raise a son and a daughter single-handedly. Nowadays her children are independent, thankfully, and Marium has turned the winter into an asset. She supports herself through sewing \"kantha\" blankets and bed covers from old cloth. \"I like to sew,\" she says. \"I'm too old for physically demanding work but because of sewing I don't have to sit idle.\" Marium, who lives with her daughter, takes pride in being able to contribute to household costs. In Panchgachi Santiram she is not alone. Several other women including neighbours Samiton, 55, and Anwara Begum, 53, who have been divorced or abandoned have also taken up the promise of the needle and thread. While most specialise in functional blankets like Marium's, some also create attractive embroidered \"nakshi kantha\" pieces. There are orders enough, particularly in winter, to drive their work. For the most part, these older women spend their days happily busy. Indeed there are younger village women also involved in the industry. Kantha production can equally appeal to the newlywed wife wishing to bring extra income into their household, in the quest for solvency. An ordinary kantha will sell for up to Tk 600 while one of quality can fetch Tk 1,500. Each requires most often second-hand cloth pieces, as well as different coloured threads to enhance the finished product's appeal. Among the buyers are the more affluent families in the village, who often supply the cloth in advance. \"Sometimes we also get orders from handicraft dealers,\" says Anwara. \"They usually ask for the best quality kanthas and pay more. Some of those products will even be exported and sold abroad.\" She says that it's possible to produce three or four kanthas in a month, but that a quality piece could take between a fortnight and a month to finish. \"Many non-government organisations give us production orders,\" says neighbour Rozina Begum, 30, who also sews. \"The remuneration they offer is good and they take delivery from the door. Sewing is really useful for women wanting additional income.\" Another advantage of sewing is that it's a social activity. Commonly they can be found together, sitting on mats under a tree or in somebody's yard, chatting about family and community issues as they sew. "

      "text": "The natural Dumni canal that nourished local agriculture and ecology for decades on the city's eastern outskirts is now being filled up to make way for real estate development. \"The tragedy is that a private land claimant is filling up this canal with truckloads of soil from an excavation site for an artificial canal along the Purbachal 300-foot road,\" said Md Emdadul Hoque, general secretary of Pink City Home Owners Multi Purpose Cooperative Society. The canal is being completely filled up, he said, adding that they had been pleading with different government authorities, including the Department of Environment and police, to save the canal since 2010 but to no avail. What was supposed to be a 120 feet wide canal now stands at only 10 feet wide. structures being built on the canal. The photos were taken near the Purbachal 300 Foot Road on Friday. Photo: Palash Khan\n Repeated public outcry and a case with the environmental court have not resulted in any changes. Government pledges and the highest courts' directives for conservation of all city canals like Dumni apparently fell on deaf ears of powerful land developers. Half a dozen land claimants-- three real estate developers, two private land claimants and a government organisation-- have so far either blocked and filled up parts of the canal or narrowed it down to one-twelfth of its official width since 2009, said locals. The canal played a vital role not only for local agriculture-based livelihood but also in draining out storm water from Dhaka city, they said. \"Around 300 families of Pink City that have depended on the canal as the primary drainage system for the last decade won't be able to live without it,\" said Rizwan Farouq, another resident of the housing. With the canal being filled up, several hundred residents of the nearby housing scheme suffered recurrent inundation of their houses with rain water this year and the previous year, Rizwan said. \n \"It is not understandable how a canal identified in official records and earmarked in Dhaka's detailed area plan (DAP) could be registered as private land,\" said Farouq, also vice-president of Pink City Home Owners Multi Purpose Cooperative Society. Two private land claimants have even built a concrete boundary wall on the canal near Dumni bridge.    Rajdhani Unnyan Kartipakkha (Rajuk), custodian of the capital city's planned and environment-friendly development, further narrowed the canal's width to merely 10 feet with a box culvert over it for Purbachal highway.  The DAP of Dhaka city, drawn up by Rajuk itself, earmarks Dumni as a 120-foot wide canal in the light of a 2006 study by British Halcrow Group on flood management in the city's eastern fringe area. The Halcrow study recommended widening and conserving of the existing canals along with storm water retention ponds and areas as flood management measures.   Md Anwar Hossain, a former project director of Purbachal New Town scheme and the current chief engineer of Rajuk, said the culvert on Dumni canal was built on the basis of a consultant's feasibility study. Pointed out that with the culvert, the canal has reduced drastically to one-twelfth of the 120 feet width proposed in the DAP, he said, \"It's not a problem, water will flow anyway. Width of a canal is to be reduced if a structure is built over it.\"         The photo on the shows the Dumni canal being choked by land development near the Purbachal 300 Foot Road in 2012. Photo: Palash Khan/File\n When asked why filling of the canal was not halted as required by wetland conservation law, Chairman of Rajuk, Md Abdur Rahman, said he would assign a field enquiry to see how the canal is being filled up and why Rajuk reduced its width with a culvert. \"Then we will take some action,\" he said. The canal originates from the Balu River in the north and winds its way through Dumni, Khadaldia and Gajaria villages to converge with the same river in the south, according to local inhabitants. The DAP map shows that a 1.5-km stretch of the canal would connect water retention areas in the north-- Bhotter, Talna, Delna, Bhaturia and Palashia-- to others in Dumni, Boro Kathaldia and Boro Beraid in the south. A committee comprised of seven ministers later altered the land use   in Kathaldia and Beraid, earmarked as water retention areas in the DAP, to accommodate extension of the private housing scheme of Bashundhara and the area is already filled up. The affected locals wrote to the environment ministry, police and environment department time and again from 2010 till last year to save the canal. The environment department filed a case and instituted three inspections but nothing came of it.   Masud Iqbal Md Shameem, director for Dhaka metropolitan area of the environment department, said, \"Let me look into the documents and see what we can do.\" Dhaka district administration in September last year identified Dumni as a five-kilometer stagnant canal filled up by Bashundhara housing authority in Kathaldia.  Earlier this month, the High Court directed the government to prepare an action plan with a list of land grabbers and area demarcation by 1 July next year to recover 50 canals in Dhaka city. Five years later, land grabbers have built a wall across the canal blocking water flow completely.Photo: Palash Khan/File\n  "

Delighted over the matter, locals joined boat processions and rallies separately organised by the district administration and 'Ichamati river protection movement' in the town yesterday morning. They demanded adequate steps to free the river from occupiers and bring back its natural flow by proper dredging. The 10-km portion of the 52-km-long Ichamati river, flowing through the district town, serves as a link between the Padma and Jamuna rivers, but it turned into a narrow canal due to indiscriminate occupation and lack of proper maintenance during the last three decades, said locals and experts. \"We are happy to see boat movement on the river after a long time,\" said journalist Abdul Matin Khan. Md Rezaul Karim, executive engineer of Pabna Water Development Board, said, \"As the mighty Padma continued to swell, we opened sluice gates of the flood protection embankment at Sadhupara in Pabna town last week and so, the rushing water from the upstream brought flow in the dead Ichamati.\" \"The flow in the dying Ichamati, however, seems a temporary matter.  It will return to its usual position when the water level in the Padma recedes after the end of the rainy season,\" he added. Pabna Deputy Commissioner (DC) Rekha Rani Balo along with the local elite as well as a large number of common people joined a boat procession on the Ichamati river yesterday morning. \"We have arranged the programme to create awareness for saving the river. Responding to people's demand, the district administration is working to save the river,\" the DC said. Earlier, on Monday, lawmaker of Pabna-5 constituency Golam Faruk Khandaker Prince joined a boat rally at Sadhupara point of the Ichamati river, highlighting the importance of saving the river. \"We have a plan to undertake a mega project to save the river,\" the lawmaker said."

The institutions include Haidor Government Primary School, Dewgram Government Primary School, Purbo Gurukshi Government Primary School, Lakhinagor Government Primary School, Fatepur Government Primary School, Nijdorgram Government Primary School, Baurbagh Haor Government Primary School, Purnanagor Government Primary School, Shirispur Government Primary School, Kochuarpar Government Primary School, Ghuramara Government Primary School, Sitingbari Government Primary School, Jolurmukh Abadipara Government Primary School and Chutokhel Government Primary School. Floodwater from the schools in Guainghat is yet to start receding as the Guain, Sary and Pyan rivers continued to swell, said the education officer. Jaintapur Upazila Education Officer Abdul Jalil Talukder said they could not hold classes for the last couple of days as Dultirpar and Diraimara government primary schools were affected by flood triggered by water from the hills. Upazila education officers have been asked to submit reports on the affected schools as early as possible, Md Nurul Islam, district education officer in Sylhet said. Md Sirajul Islam, executive engineer of Water Development Board (WDB) in Sylhet, said thousands of people in the low-lying areas of the upazilas are marooned. Dr Mamun-ur-Rashid, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) in Sylhet, said boro paddy and vegetables on over 73 thousand hectares of land in the upazilas have gone under water."

      "text": "In a country of 16 crore people, the central offices of all government bodies and institutions are in Dhaka. The most job opportunities, the best schools, colleges, universities, healthcare options and even the services required by business operators are far more readily available here than any other place in the whole country.  Bangladesh's population density, which is an issue in itself, is magnified manifold in Dhaka. An estimated 400,000 people move into the city every year. It has secured Dhaka a place among the fastest growing megacities, but also classifies it on the more unsavoury list of most densely populated cities. It currently has an estimated population of about 1.7 crore. This puts a strain on the city itself. Its infrastructure, sustainability, maintenance, and development are all impeded by the sheer scale of the problems, which are practically impossible to tackle en masse.  Even though the problems from the lack of a decent service and utility infrastructure affect every inhabitant, very few of these actually come close to the suffering caused by traffic congestion. Although it is definitely more comfortable to fret in the back of an air-conditioned car while stuck on the road for hours, especially compared to the mostly awful and subpar public transport options, in its effects on loss of time and opportunity for all individuals, Dhaka traffic is a great equaliser.  According to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Global Liveability Survey for 2016, an annual report of quality of life, Dhaka landed at 137 out of 140, barely above war-torn Damascus, Lagos, and Tripoli.  Ask a local and few will think to negate that, based on traffic conditions alone. Despite being central to the country's growth, a booming business sector, and thriving real estate, Dhaka epitomises urban dysfunction to researchers and experts, simply due to its chaotic traffic situation. The problem is all-pervasive and has seeped into the cores of all city dwellers' lives. Any and all activities have to be planned around the truth that is traffic. Traffic is fundamentally the demand and supply gap of the people's need for and scope of mobility. It is when a large number of service seekers are squeezed through an insufficient capacity system that congestion occurs and forms bottlenecks to exacerbate the problem, and Dhaka traffic is no different. Almost every single person in the city has need for area-to-area mobility each day. This includes people from all sectors of life; the office-goer is as pressed for time as the school student. This brings to focus the two major problems with Dhaka: its massive population, and the sheer magnitude of demand for mobility within the city and its outskirts.\nThe matter is compounded by the fact that roads cover just seven percent of Dhaka city, compared to about 30 percent in modern cities like Paris and 40 percent in Chicago. The city itself, and greater Dhaka to an extent, has essentially expanded without a plan. This has led to a disproportionate pressure on just the three thoroughfares that form the skeleton of the city's road network--Mirpur Road, Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue-Airport Road, and Pragati Sharani. Revisiting the issue of creation of bottlenecks, these three roads are crucial to, and unavoidable, for transport within different neighbourhoods of the city, leading to creation of frequent bottlenecks at numerous transits and connecting points to other smaller vein roads.  There are more than 650 intersections of note, and less than 70 traffic lights! Also, most of these are not truly functioning, even if they are changing colours now and then, since not one vehicle, or pedestrian, would think it necessary to heed to them. This means that the already short-staffed police force is spread thin further, managing the chaos on the roads and directing traffic, and left practically incapable of enforcing driving, parking or traffic laws and regulations. The next aspect, so to speak, is the lack of options in public transport. As elitist as it may sound, the bus operators, and most consumers within the city, assume that public transport is for the less privileged of the society--those who cannot afford their own transport, or at least work for large enough companies that provide pick-and-drop service for their employees. And as there is a huge part of the city's population that are in fact at the bottom of the income pyramid, the public transport operators are always at full capacity or even dangerously overloaded, and feel no need to improve service quality. A 2009 World Bank analysis found 60 bus services of various sizes operating in Dhaka with routes and fares that varied whimsically. Passengers are usually charged for the distance travelled, but there is no real system of fixing the fare. What is more concerning is that the same analysis found that less than about half of all bus drivers and even fewer auto-rickshaw drivers had genuine licenses making accountability and discipline severely difficult to enforce. As much as we want to blame the police for overlooking such flagrant flouting of the law, the enforcers are generally a mere reflection of the population. Compounding the problem is the relentless flow of new cars, further burdening the already beleaguered road network of the city. An estimated 40,000 additional cars make their way onto the city's already stifled roads annually, and the numbers can only grow as the middle income segment of the society expands and looks to improve their standard of living. Another major issue, easily visible to the naked eye, is the massive number of rickshaws plying the roads. This mixed nature of Dhaka's traffic also affects speed of commute in the city. Inarguably, these are also very important to the city's system and the lives of people who cannot afford private transport.  The average peak hour speed of Dhaka traffic, an indicator of the road system's efficiency, has been \"exponentially falling since being calculated at 25 km/hour in 1997, to 16 km/hour in 2004, and 12 km/hour in 2010. It is now estimated as being 6.4 km/hour,\" says Professor Md Shamsul Hoque of the civil engineering department of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. \nThe cost of Dhaka's traffic congestion, as per recent estimates, is projected as cleaving USD 12 billion out of the economy annually. The government itself thinks the gridlocks devour 3.2 million working hours each day. Projected over the years this has cost Bangladesh perhaps many times over the damage done by the periodic cyclones in terms of loss of productive capacity and human capital. There is also the issue of the human cost. The stress of being on the roads, the uncertainty, and the sheer exhaustion have a significant human toll as well. Studies estimate that as much as 70 percent of the city's residents are suffering from some kind of physical ailment caused or contributed to by the traffic condition. This includes mental issues fuelled by frustration, breathing issues, headaches, skin problems, hearing loss and even blood pressure and heart issues. All this inevitably has a significant human impact on the already inadequate healthcare system, and economic consequences. As traffic congestion remains very visible and seemingly perpetual in the capital, almost all governments have tried to tackle it. We see periodic steps to deal with the problem. These include conducting feasibility studies, of which the most recent one, RSTP, aims to invest about USD 38 billion to make Dhaka more liveable by 2035, and fixing the traffic issue is a main target.  The most visible step on part of the government has been to build flyovers. The Bus Rapid Transit or Mass Rapid Transit projects have yet to be realised, as they understandably take a lot of time and funds to execute. Work has started on the Metro Rail project but most other projects have either been sidelined or are really far away from realisation.\nFlyovers have a fundamental issue of taking up precious space in the middle of the road, with the standing pillars, divvying already scarce space with the ramps, as well as limiting underground building options.  It perhaps adds four lanes overhead, but it also covers up two lanes beneath it, and massively restricts the possibility of mass or bus transit. Moreover, flyovers encourage smaller vehicles, with a larger carbon footprint, as well as have restricted capacity of carrying commuters.  Another fundamental issue about the layering of road space is the adaptive nature of congestion: the smaller vehicles, with large environmental impact and carrying the least number of people per unit, are also most probable to take over the flyovers.  The major fundamental change that we need to focus on is policy adaptation to uniquely suit our needs--the massive number of people, lack of space, unplanned and growing city.  Demand is ever-increasing with the constant influx of people, and we do not have the right of way in most of the city. This means that any development in the crowded parts of the cities has to be extremely cautious as well as utility and capacity maximising.  One bus rapid transit (BRT), or a dedicated bus lane, has the capacity to provide service equivalent or more than ten normal traffic lanes, and is probably the least expensive and time-consuming initiative to implement. The dedicated lane increases the scope for public transportation in both numbers of commuters and savings in terms of time. For this to be effective, the transport system, however, itself needs to be overhauled. There has to be objective and perhaps centralised ticketing, efficient route plans and proper systems of maintenance and accountability. The main player in this regard has to be the public or state-owned transport services, at least in the beginning. \"A single BRT lane can have the capacity of ten physical lanes operationally,\" says Professor Hoque.  This also has the advantage of not always requiring land acquisition of road building, as some existing lanes of the wider roads can simply be reassigned. The second option, although perhaps more expensive and more time-consuming, is taking the bulk of the movement underground, through a train service. In places it is operating, it is adding value of almost 15 physical lanes, due to higher carriage capacity. However, there is a concern of whether there are enough physiographic properties in the land, to allow for long-lasting subterranean projects. The third aspect, equally important, as Professor Hoque said, is to focus on areas which are part of the greater Dhaka metropolitan, but are not yet fully built, where there are still open spaces available for building wide roads, and for allowing proper planning of townships. A very modern option is the use of elevated expressways, both for rapid and mass transit, and especially in the place of embankments. Embankments, although once deemed necessary against nature's whimsy, have proved to be counterproductive in many places. They also necessitate massive land acquisition, especially when compared to created service capacity, and also requires massive amounts of building materials. Expressways, however, allow for minimal footprint, and will not physically bifurcate elements of the environment, be it physical, human or ecological. \"We have to think of adaptive infrastructure,\" says Professor Hoque, adding, \"We must also make sure appropriate usage of the infrastructure.\" A lot of our good infrastructure is being damaged by our abusive use. \"Overloading is a huge issue. It is contributing massive damages to highways, bridges, and even ferry gangways, and contributing to accidents.\" He also says, \"We need proper policies to prevent abuse of the built infrastructure. Even small adaptations, like patronisation for good projects, and allowing for innovative thinking, like opting for expressways.\"  The writer is a sub-editor at The Daily Star and can be reached at aiman_sania@live.com. \n"

The development comes after the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) yesterday extended the tenure of project by another two years. It was not given further funds. The project was taken up in 2003 for completion by 2005 at a cost of Tk 176 crore. Since then, both the timescale and cost of the project have been extended several times. In 2013, the project cost was fixed at Tk 1,078 crore and the completion date by June 2016. But the planning ministry later extended the tenure to June 2017. About 60 percent work has been completed, according to a planning ministry official. The main component of the project, the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP), which was scheduled for completion by August, is yet to be functional. The main aim of the project was to relocate the tanneries at Hazaribagh to Savar for preventing environment pollution. So far, 92 of the 155 factories have relocated. In the absence of a functional CETP, the plants are now polluting the water of the Dhaleswari river. A team from the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division will soon visit Savar to verify if the units were actually contaminating the river, said Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal. The prime minister has called for a dormitory for workers of the leather estate and the planning ministry will soon get to work on that, he added. At yesterday's meeting, a total of 8 projects costingTk 4,979 crore were approved. One of them was the 'smaller water resources development (2nd phase)' project for Tk 1,286 crore. The project, whose aim is to boost the non-farm income of rural people, will include flood management, water sanitation and water retention and will be implemented in 220 upazilas under 29 districts in Dhaka, Mymensingh, Sylhet and Rangpur divisions. Ecnec also approved a Tk 582.30-crore project for setting up the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences at eight medical college hospitals. The Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission under the Ministry of Science and Technology will implement the project by June 2020. A planning ministry official said once the institutes were established it would be possible to easily diagnose and provide treatment to various diseases like thyroid, kidney, liver and bone cancer through nuclear technology. It will provide treatment to the poor and common people at an affordable cost. Ecnec also gave the nod to a Tk 1,249.05-crore project for power distribution system extension and renovation of West Zone areas."

      "text": "People of Gangber village in Chapra union under Sadar upazila of the district have set an example of innovation by building a floating bridge over the Charalkata river at low cost utilising local resources. They did that as the lone bamboo bridge over the river, which isolates the village from the mainland, gets washed away every year during flood, disrupting communication and causing immense sufferings to them. \"Every year, locals make a bamboo bridge with their own money and resources as the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) is yet to build a concrete bridge,\" said Chapra Union Parishad (UP) Chairman Khalilur Rahman. \"The bridge is swept away every year in the rainy season, snapping communication and compelling locals to pass their days without economic activities,\" the chairman added. Local UP member Khaliqul Islam said villagers formed a committee three months ago to find a way to solve the problem. Committee president Shariful Islam said they decided to build a floating bridge using empty steel drums and bamboos so that the more the river swelled the more the bridge would rise with the water level. \"Raising funds from villagers, we bought 70 drums, 1,000 bamboos, nylon rope, iron pins and other necessary items,\" said committee secretary Shahidul Islam. Village youths worked voluntarily under carpenter Nur Hossain to make 35 rows of interconnected drums, each with two drums tied to a bamboo platform with nylon rope, and floated them on the water keeping a 4-foot gap between drums. Both ends of the bridge were tied to giant trees on the banks of the river with thick metallic rope so that it does not get swept away by the current, Shahidul said, adding that a bamboo platform was laid on the drums and tied tightly. Motorbikes and easybikes can cross the 240-foot-long bridge easily. \"The floating bridge has given us relief as we can now go to distant markets to sell agriculture produce even in the rainy season,\" said farmer Jonab Ali, 60, of the village. Day labourer Karimul, 45, said he can now go to other villages for work. Upazila Engineer of LGED Saiful Islam said it is a great achievement as the villagers built the sustainable bridge at minimum cost and with local technology. \"People of Gangber village have shown that where there is a will there is a way, and resource constrains cannot stand in the way,\" said Sadar Upazila Parishad Chairman Abu Jar Rahman."

At the counter, there was a small line of people looking to book their tickets early. At the front of the queue, the person behind the counter kept yawning midway through sorting out tickets. \"Gondamara union, Banshkhali\", I said. He adjusted himself in his seat. \"Gondamara? Okhane to manush ke martese.\" (They're killing people there). It was an ominous start to a long trip towards the westernmost part of the Chittagong division, Gondamara union in Banskhali upazila. Over time it became clear that Gondamara union was not only incredibly disconnected from the rest of the upazila and the greater Chittagong area, it was also one of the most vulnerable places in the country to cyclones and tidal flooding. When hurricanes formed in the Bay of Bengal make their way towards the land, a frequented route is right through Gondamara union. When cyclone Sidr hit the coast, Gondamara union suffered the heaviest damage in terms of flooding, deaths and destruction of crops and houses. While Sidr was a very large cyclone formation--one of the largest to hit Bangladesh--even weaker cyclonic winds have caused extensive damage to the area. On May 20, 2016, cyclone Roanu made landfall and Gondamara became one of the worst hit areas in the country. The storm caused embankments to flood and destroyed roads, houses and salt farms in the area. It has been estimated that several million taka worth of salt and fish were damaged by the cyclone. The residents of Gondamara, however, were going through a crisis long before the cyclone had struck. The Chinese firm SEPCOI, in partnership with S. Alam Group, had been given permission to build two coal-fired power plants right at the cusp of the Bay of Bengal, in Gondamara union. On December 19, 2013, the Bangladeshi conglomerate S. Alam group signed an agreement with SEPCOII Electric Power Construction Corporation of China to set up coal-fired power plants in Chittagong with a capacity of 1320 megawatts. Afterwards, S. Alam began identifying possible areas for the construction of the power plants before finally deciding on Gondamara union in Banshkhali as the final location for their power plants. S. Alam group purchased 655 acres of land on the coast of Gondamara for the two 660 megawatt power plants. On April 4, 2016 Banshkhali witnessed the worst tragedy in a coal-related protest since the protests in Jharkhand, India in 2012. Four protesters were killed as police and cadres met the protesters with bullets and tear gas (The Daily Star, April 5, 2016). Locals allege many wrongdoings in the way S. Alam acquired the land. Their main objections include falsehood while purchasing the land, not paying the entire amount promised and, above all, not letting the locals know until much later that the land was for a coal-fired power plant. They point to their shrimp hatcheries, their large fishing projects and their salt farms and logically claim that all of these practices stand to be negatively impacted by the coal plant. Over time, the claims were repeated with growing resignation as Gondamara union slowly became the new frontier of state-sanctioned corporate exploitation. Media coverage of the issue has been truly indicative of the corporate loyalties and disappearing ethics of large newspapers and television stations. But even when there has been coverage, the true extent of the potential ramifications of the power plant has been overlooked. We spent a few days in Gondamara after the protests had begun as part of an archiving mission for Center For Bangladesh Studies (CBS). Over time, it became evident that there were two Gondamaras, figuratively speaking. There was a Gondamara to the east and a Gondamara to the West, both sides divided by the embankment that cyclone Roanu had destroyed. Most of the media coverage remained restricted to the east where the landed gentry and Liakat Ali, the BNP politician, resided. On the other side of the broken dam, the reality was entirely different. It took us quite a while to traverse through the mud and broken paths of what was once the barrier that separated the large, lucrative fishing projects from the sea water. We were essentially crossing over to the area where the power plant was being constructed, although the storm and the protests had momentarily halted the construction. There, we encountered men, women and children all busy wading through the waves. They were catching small shrimp hatchlings and small fish that swam up to the shore. On the coast, there was a large canopy of tamarisk (jhau) trees which formed the last barrier to winds and tidal surges coming towards Gondamara. We could still see the places where the trees had been uprooted by the wind. The locals said they cleared the area from uprooted trees after the storm, which had cleaned up most of the damage. The dynamics of this coastal population were strikingly different from the residents further inland. Women, children and men all carried out their work next to each other. They rested, chatted and ate their lunch under the shade of the trees before going back to work. They supplied the hatchlings to traders inland who then supplied it to large shrimp farms. They spent their lives next to the ocean and were in sync with every transition of a wave. Their fishing of crabs, shrimp and small fish is all done by manual tools, which makes sure there isn't overfishing, or overpopulation of one species. Put simply, they formed an integral part of the coastal ecology, they kept it safe and clean, they survived on it and in many ways, it survived on them. More than any cyclone ever could, the power plant in Gondamara poses a major threat to the balanced ecology of the region and to all its inhabitants. Conventional coal-fired power plants, which make water boil to generate steam that activates a turbine, have an efficiency of about 32 percent. Supercritical (SC) and ultra-supercritical (USC) power plants operate at temperatures and pressures above the critical point of water, i.e. above the temperature and pressure at which the liquid and gas phases of water coexist in equilibrium, at which point there is no difference between water gas and liquid water. This results in higher efficiencies--above 45 percent. Supercritical (SC) and ultra -supercritical (USC) power plants require less coal per megawatt-hour, leading to lower emissions (including carbon dioxide and mercury), higher efficiency and lower fuel costs per megawatt. Globally, the average efficiency of coal-fired generation is 33 percent HHV (higher heating value) basis or 35 percent LHV (lower heating value) basis. In a survey of countries worldwide, the average three-year (2009-2011) efficiency of coal-fired electric generating fleets ranged from a low of 26 percent in India to a high of 41 percent in France. It is difficult to estimate the exact percentage of energy that would be effectively used by SS Power Ltd without knowing the kind of coal to be imported and the types of technologies to be used both in the pre and post-heating process. The only relevant bit of information provided by S. Alam in this case has been that to mitigate pollution, the project will construct a 90-storey chimney system, according to Abdul Hanna, assistant manager of the project. Regardless of the kind of technology and coal to be utilised, there are certain solid and non-solid emissions that will take place due to the operations of the power plant. These include, but are not limited to: (i) Sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, damages crops, forests, and soils, and acidifies lakes and streams. A typical coal plant with emissions controls, including flue gas desulfurisation (smokestack scrubbers), emits 7,000 tons of SO2 per year; (ii) nitrous oxides, which causes ground level ozone, or smog, which can burn lung tissue, exacerbate asthma, and make people more susceptible to chronic respiratory diseases. A typical coal plant with emissions controls, including selective catalytic reduction technology, emits 3,300 tons of NOx per year; (iii) mercury, a toxic heavy metal that causes brain damage and heart problems. Just 1/70th of a teaspoon of mercury deposited on a 25-acre lake can make the fish unsafe to eat' (iv) carbon dioxide, which is the leading contributor of greenhouse gases; (v) fly ash, which can cause chronic bronchitis, aggravated asthma, and premature death, as well as haze obstructing visibility. Other discharges may include lead, arsenic and carbon monoxide. In coal power plants with once-through cooling systems, once the 70 to 180 billion gallons of water have cycled through the power plant (for a typical 600-megawatt plant), they are released back into the lake, river, or ocean. This water is hotter (by up to 20-25deg F) than the water with which it is mixed, creating \"thermal pollution\" that can decrease fertility and increase heart rates in fish. All of this is by now common knowledge to those who have been campaigning so long against the Rampal coal power plant near the Sundarbans. There has not been a word about in months about Banshkhali. The story goes that Sundarbans protects us from cyclones; it is a national heritage and its beauty is unparalleled. We must not let it be destroyed. It seems more important to protest Rampal than Banshkhali, perhaps because the centre (urban, middle-class) has more to lose in the former than the latter. With the Sundarbans, we lose a national heritage with which we feel a sense of belonging--that beautiful place in our pictures and our textbooks. Mariam, a fisherwoman, invited us to her house and made a meal for us. She kept smiling as she spoke about her children, her own work and the rebuilding after the storm. She spoke of the ocean with a sense of familiarity and respect that I could not understand. She spoke of the power plant with fierce anger and pain. Her mother-in-law and sister sat next to her as she entertained her guests. From the other side of the room, the kids peered in. Mariam handed them a couple of biscuits. By 2020, when the power plant is operational, it is likely that Mariam and her family will no longer be in the west of Gondamara. It is also likely that the complex and sustainable ecology that we saw will no longer exist. It is unlikely that such beautiful ecologies will be able to survive the country's aggressive development agenda. Is that not important enough for a protest?

      "text": "Abdur and Abdul Gain are standing in lungi outside their homes, surveying the vegetable garden and bald fruit trees that were descimated by seawater during flooding last year. Both men live in Chandghar, a village which lies on a polder 160 kilometre south of Dhaka. After the flood, they had to leave their home and land. Now they live in a hut on an embankment, made of bamboo and plastic. Bangladesh has 139 polders. They were created with the help of Dutch development money in the 1960s and 1970s to protect around nine million farmers from flooding and salinisation. That number is comparable to the population of Dutch people who live in areas that risk flooding if they are not defended properly. Like Bangladesh, the Netherlands is also a flat, delta country. The Bangladeshi delta is wedged between the Himalaya and the sea and is formed by the confluence of the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna. These rivers supply fertile sediment for agriculture, but they also bring flooding and embankment erosion. Without dikes, a large part of the country becomes submerged during the rainy season. But now the polders are themselves under pressure from the process of sand deposition. \"They have become ponds,\" explains climate expert Atiq Rahman. People pressure is more important. Bangladesh, with a population of 160 million people, is growing by two million inhabitants per year. \"They all want food and a roof over their heads, but that's a huge task in a delta in which the water and land merge in to each other smoothly,\" says Atiq.  He is optimistic, because like the delta, Bangladeshis are dynamic and resilient: thousands of coastal residents are forced to relocate several times in their lifetimes and so they are accustomed to creating new homes elsewhere. Because of global warming, Bangladeshis are further put to the test. Tropical cyclones are occurring more often and becoming more intense, average temperatures have risen by 0.65 degrees Celsius in the last 60 years and the mean annual rainfall has increased by 10 percent.  Atiq Rahman predicts that millions of people in the country will be displaced if sea levels rise by one metre. And as the water rises, the salt penetrates deeper inland, which adversely affects agriculture and the food supply. Dutch experts to help Bangladesh\nIn order to repel the three-pronged danger of population pressure, saltwater and climate change, Dutch companies and knowledge institutes are on hand to help Bangladesh again. This time with the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, a long-term vision for water and food security, economic growth and sustainable development that should better equip the country to deal with natural disasters and climate change. The Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 is now ready for approval by the Bangladeshi government. A consortium led by Netherlands-based consultancy agency Twynstra Gudde is guiding the process, with financial assistance from the Dutch government. So far, the plan has been well received. The Bangladesh government is decisive: in a short time all stakeholders have been consulted and the Delta Plan has been adopted in the national, so-called five-year plan. Following a blueprint common in the Netherlands, a Delta Commissioner will determine and implement the Delta Programme annually, with support from a Delta Fund which has ambitiously allocated 4 billion euros per year until 2050. There are 150 projects currently under review by the World Bank, which was involved in planning at an early stage. The large-scale plan has come in for some criticism as well, however. According to some experts, Bangladesh leans too much on the input of foreign consultants seeking to take positions in the country. In addition, a lack of money and time means only existing knowledge has been brought together with no new research developed, which would make the quality of the basic studies too low. Finally, some Dutch experts raise the question of whether the Delta Plan has become too much of an engineering plan, insufficiently connected to the environment. Moving from planning to success\nOne of the Dutch experts involved in the Delta Plan 2100 is Catharien Terwisscha van Scheltinga, researcher on climate adaptation and water management at Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands. She is able to draw on her experience at home when considering the tangible steps Bangladesh should take to implement the plan. \"In a country that grew up with five-year plans, it's easier to take a decision about the plan at a high level than to actually get it off the ground,\" she says. Catharien says the Bangladesh government has already started implementing the plan through improved coordination and collaboration between finance, projects and institutions such as the World Bank, foreign governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). \"But it doesn't solve the water issues in delta areas; a successful approach requires a government strategy that is linked to the local people's tactics, and intertwined with local culture, history and interests,\" she says. In other words, the Bangladesh government must not only develop new projects, but also target existing good practices towards the long-term goals of the Delta Plan. The Blue Gold Programme, for example, helps farmers in polder areas to boost agricultural productivity and profitability through training on improved agronomic practices, value chain development and effective water management. This is being achieved through a combination of actions: hard interventions such as sluices and elevating dikes; soft interventions including the introduction of improved rice varieties; and education for farmers. \"The Delta Plan is not about infrastructure only,\" Catharien adds. \"We also need to invest in the culture of dialogue and development of knowledge, for example on subsidence and sand deposits. This is extremely important, because the large amount of sediments that flow from the river into the sea can be used for land reclamation, thus creating a buffer against sea level rise.\" Handy, because Bangladesh needs new land. However, the researcher believes it has to be a broad dialogue and debate on reclamation, so that people will not regret a hundred years from now.  \"Looking at it from a Dutch private sector interest, we are eager to participate in this process because our water sector has extensive experience on dredging techniques. However, we have to make sure that we don't push Bangladesh into the Delta Plan in a Dutch way. It must be designed for and owned by Bangladesh,\" Catharien says. Lessons to be learned\nThis should be an important driving force behind the elaboration of plans for all those threatened delta areas in the world: giving hope and a new future to people who cannot escape the cycle of poverty. In other words, do not make plans to earn money from the Bangladesh delta, but take the responsibility to change people's lives for the better. The story relates yet another lesson. From above, the Netherlands looks harmonious and orderly, while the river delta and decision-making process of Bangladesh can be characterised as dynamic and informal. This will be very helpful in emergency situations, like during a cyclone, when Bangladeshis are at their best: they can quickly mobilise village communities into taking immediate action.  \"We fish and live one day at a time,\" explains Abdur Gain as he overlooks the river: \"On the other side, they are building a new village, because of sediments that have been deposited by the flow. Maybe we'll move there.\" Joep Janssen is a Dutch urban delta expert and author of the book Living with the Mekong.

      "text": "A pond is not just a water body necessary for reducing waterlogging in an area, it also comes in handy during a fire incident. But most importantly, a pond tells a tale of time. The reflective surface of these centuries-old vital organs offer a glimpse into the past -- time spent together swimming or bathing in those, community atmospheres and upheavals of lives. Most of the ponds in the capital have unique histories of their own. Many were dug up to help people get respite. Many to enhance the beauty of a neighbourhood while many as retention areas. Some of these water bodies are not just rich with history, they are also \"mysterious\". Some are surrounded by shrouds of mystery, while some by superstition. There are two such \"mysterious\" ponds inside Dhaka University (DU). One of them is at the Faculty of Fine Arts, popularly known as Charukala, and the other one inside Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall. There is a place inside Charukala, which from far looks like a large crater. It is circular and filled with various trees. While speaking with many of the students, they said the crater is actually a pond. Known as Gol Pukur (circular pond), the area is around 2 bighas. This correspondent also spoke with the university officials and teachers. They said the pond has been in a waterless state for years. They have tried numerous times to fill it up. But the water inside the reservoir seems to...disappear. Not just the disappearance of water, the reservoir also has a long history, adding to its enigma. The legend goes that the water body was dug up back in the 17th century. The owner of the pond was Naib Nazim Nusrat Jung. He was a deputy subahdar (governor of a subah or province) who used to assist the Nawab (ruler) in administering the outlying areas. One Moinuddin Hossain used to recite from the Quran at his darbar (court). Nusrat Jung was pleased with Moinuddin's performance and donated him a piece of land along with the reservoir. After Moinuddin's death, his son inherited the property. The Nawab of Dhaka wanted to purchase the property. But the son had a condition. He said a chamber with twelve doors known as \"Baraduari\" will have to be constructed along with a shrine of his father. The nawab agreed. He also constructed a \"hanging bedi\" (platform) over the pond for arranging jalsas, which included singing and dancing. A house was also constructed on the western side for many of the performers to reside. Once during such a soiree, around six people were killed as the platform collapsed. Since then, the performances had been stopped. Afterwards, the property including the pond came under the Art College in 1952. Architect Mazharul Islam following the suggestion of Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin prepared the design of Charukala in 1953, said Prof Nisar Hossain of the faculty of fine arts. But the Baraduari was already dismantled. He said the shrine is still protected inside the institution. The authorities of the institution constructed the banks of the pond, which is still intact, he said. \"The pond had water in it till the 60s. During the early 70s, it was dug up more and as a result, layers of underlain sand came out from the bottom. Since then, the water did not sustain in it.\" Prof ASM Maksud Kamal, chairman of the university's disaster science and management department, said soil texture and structure greatly influence water infiltration, permeability, and water-holding capacity of an area. \"The clay from the bottom of the pond was removed, which affected the water body. Due to high permeability, water goes underground and does not sustain.\" Also over the years, the ground-water level has declined for which it remains out of water. During the rainy season, the reservoir gets filled up a little as the groundwater level increases. But at other times, it remains empty, he said. Prof Nisar said the clay of a pond holds the water and does not let the water go underground. \"But due to a lack of clay, it's not happening here.\" \"We are not cleaning the pond so clay can be generated naturally through organic materials such as dead leaves and branches. Now, after a heavy rain, water stays in the pond for a few days,\" he said. There is another pond inside the campus, which has also been without water, said Prof Nisar. The around 2-bigha reservoir is inside the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall. Vice Chancellor Prof Dr AAMS Arefin Siddique said the pond was polluted due to dumping of waste. \"But after taking charge, I took an initiative to renovate it.\" He said the water does not sustain in the pond despite digging. \"But we don't want to dig too deep as that might be risky for the nearby buildings.\" \"We are taking steps to protect it considering the technical problem,\" said the VC. Echoing him, Prof Mofizur Rahman, provost of the hall, said, \"We want to keep the pond intact.\" The reservoir inside Shishu Park (children's amusement park) in Shahbagh is also known as a \"mysterious pond\" as water does not stay in it for long. The around one-bigha water body is filled with trees and bushes. The pond is there since the Pakistan period. \"It's a mysterious pond. Even if it gets filled up with rainwater, the water does not stay for long,\" said Mohammad Zakir Hossain, sub-assistant engineer of Dhaka South City Corporation. He said during the 1988 flood, the entire Shishu Park was submerged in water. Afterwards, it took a long time for the water to recede. \"But the pond dried up within a couple of days.\" The Shishu Park was established on 15 acres of land in 1979. \"There is a plan to construct water fountains in place of the pond. It will be done under a project of the Public Works Department (PWD).\" Prof ASM Maksud Kamal of Dhaka University said, \"Like the other two ponds [in Charukala and Bangabandhu Hall], this one also remains empty except for the rainy season.\" \"The pond was dug up couple of times that affected the layer of clay. As a result, water does not sustain in it.\" Though the pond at Shahidullah Hall is not devoid of water, it does not make it any less mysterious. Many of the students and staff believe there is \"something\" in the bottom of the water body that pulls a person towards it while swimming. Though experts have ruled out the superstition, almost every year people have died by drowning in it. Around eight people including students of the university drowned in the pond in the last 10 years, said Billal Hossain, senior administrative officer of the hall. \"There is something mysterious about this pond. Many have said they felt as if they were being pulled towards the bottom while swimming.\" Mohiuddin, principal administrative officer of the hall, said, \"Even good swimmers have drowned in it.\" He said they have set up signboards warning students not to swim there. DU Prof Firoz Zaman of geology department, however, said there is no such mystery surrounding the reservoir. \"The pond is very old and its water has become polluted. As the level of oxygen is less due to the pollution, the water became heavier. As a result, it is difficult to swim in it even for the experts.\" The hall was established in 1921. But the pond was there before that. Earlier, it was also used by the students of Dhaka College. There are three ghats (landing spots) in it, two on the western side and one on the eastern side. The pond is around 7 bighas and surrounded by trees and benches. Whether these ponds are surrounded by any mystery or not, they are still a vital element of the city and worth preserving.   The Dhaka University area is adorned with many ponds and most of them are being maintained with care. The reservoirs are surrounded by trees and there are also benches by the banks where one can sit and enjoy the serenity of the water. Students are often seen gossiping or studying by the water bodies. Vice Chancellor Prof Dr AAMS Arefin Siddique said they will take more initiatives to protect all the ponds of the university as there is a scarcity of water bodies in the city. The pond at Jagannath Hall is there since the British period. The around 4-bigha reservoir is used by the students for bathing and swimming. It is being maintained with care. There are two ghats on its western and eastern sides. The reservoir is surrounded by trees such as jack fruit, mango and krishnachura. Nikunja Chandra Roy, a hall official, said they dug up the pond again around six years back as part of its renovation work. The ghat on the western side was constructed during that time. \"We try to keep it clean regularly,\" he said. Though around 50 percent of the century-old Shibbari Staff Quarter pond was filled up by the DU authorities to construct a multi-storey residential building for the university's fourth class employees, it is still in a relatively better condition. The building was constructed in 2013-2014. Contacted, the VC said the building was constructed to protect the pond properly. \"We have already constructed the banks for its protection.\" The pond is there since the establishment of the hall in 1957. Sirajul Islam, principal administration officer of the hall, said, \"We used to arrange swimming competition in it for students around 15 years back.\" Earlier, the name of the hall was Iqbal Hall, and the pond was known as Iqbal Hall pond. \"The hall was renamed Sergeant Jahurul Haque in 1972.\" The depth of the around 8-bigha reservoir is around 15 feet. It is also maintained by the authorities concerned on a regular basis. \"We would like to do some additional renovation work for that we need proper funding,\" he said. The engineering section of the university used to maintain the pond, which came under the Hall Employee Samity in 1978. \"We also cultivated fish in it, which stopped in 2015.\" The around 1.5-bigha pond, located behind the Bangladesh National Museum is surrounded by trees and being maintained properly by the authorities concerned. Sayed Shamsul, education officer at the museum, said, \"We renovated the pond in 1983 after the museum was shifted to Shahbagh. Before, it used to be an abandoned water body.\" He said they try to keep the reservoir clean on a regular basis. Litan Khandakar, a museum staff, said, \"There was a scarcity of water in the area around 20 years back. The staff used to use it for bathing.\" There are two ponds inside Osmani Udyan that are being maintained properly by the authorities concerned. Among the two, the one on the western side is around five acres while other one on the eastern side around 2 acres. The reservoirs are surrounded by trees enhancing the serenity of the area. Many still bathe in those. The centuries-old pond inside the Ramna Kali Mandir is in an awful state. It is currently owned by the government. Amlan Kumar Kartik, member secretary (finance) of the Mandir, said according to historian AH Dani, the pond (dighi) was dug up by Queen of Bhawal Bilas Moni. On the other hand, the documents of the British period shows that the reservoir was dug up by magistrate Charles Dawes to meet the locals' need for drinking water. \"We have already applied to five ministries for the ownership of the pond so that we can look after it...,\" he said.

      "text": "The death of a few thousand ducks at the beginning of the breeding season has led to fear and apprehension among the farmers in Sylhet division. The cause of the deaths is unknown. At least 3,902 ducks have died since April 15 affecting almost 102 farmers in the area, according to livestock department officials. Rubel Miah, a duck farmer in Sunamganj sadar upazila, has 2500 ducks he raises on the banks of Dekhar Haor in the district. His ducks have so far survived the \"unknown threat\" but Miah lives in fear each day of what might yet happen. \"I am frightened as ducks are dying for unknown reasons after flash floods hit the haor areas. I tried to prevent my ducks from swimming in the deep haor water,\" Rubel Miah told The Daily Star recently. Miah breeds two farms of ducks which are his only earning source throughout the year. Like Rubel, thousands of duck farmers in Sylhet division fear they might lose their ducks, but after almost a month of flash flood, some are hoping the worst is behind them now. According to the Department of Livestock Services there are 3572 duck farms in Sylhet division among which 2707 are in Sunamganj, 457 in Habiganj, 292 in Moulvibazar and 116 in Sylhet district. The livestock department considers a business as a farm only if it has at least a thousand ducks and there are thousands of smaller farmers in the haor areas which remain outside their purview because of the size of their business. Mansur Ahmed, a duck farmer from Sylhet Sadar upazila, has been farming for 10 years. However, he remains a small farmer and fears losing his investment if the outbreak hits his farm. According to the livestock department, duck farms are prone to duck cholera in this season when paddy plants are submerged in the haor for processing. Md Giyas Uddin, Sylhet divisional deputy director of the Department of Livestock Services, said there was a sign of duck cholera outbreak in the haor areas recently but that situation was contained and the water now is safe for ducks. However, many regular duck farmers have stopped farming and some didn't even start in fear of the \"mysterious\" deaths, he said. \"We are encouraging the farmers to resume farming,\" Giyas said. "

What makes this tender alarming is that the buildings that are to be replaced house one of the most vulnerable populations of our city: Dalit cleaners, many of whom are now on the brink of eviction. The colony includes a British era hospital, which now accommodates thousands of landless Dalit cleaners. They lived in Azimpur until 1962, when they faced resettlement due to the authority's decision to replace their neighbourhood with a hostel for the students of Eden College. The colony, then an abandoned tuberculosis hospital, has five four-storied buildings, with each consisting of 40 tiny rooms. Currently, each room shelters, on average, 3-4 persons.   Kiran Das lives with his mother and four siblings in such a house comprising three small rooms. His modest house happens to be one of the better ones in the entire building. With a TV in a corner, the first room has a sofa and a bed, whereas the second contains a small Ganesh statue, a table, and a bed. While entering the third room, which accommodates the kitchen and a bed, through a narrow aisle, his mother points to the leaking plumbing pipe, which causes putrid water to drip down the walls. \"We were forced to shift our dining arrangement,\" says his mother. \"How can one eat in such a condition?\"  Alongside the congested homes are drains filled with liquid waste. \"Our people clean the city, yet we live in such a filthy environment,\" Kiran says, adding that it takes little rain to flood the ground rooms with muddy water. A few blocks away, as many as 15 people of an extended family are squeezed in a few rooms, six people crashing on a bed. There are five or six toilets in each storey for the dozens of people. In the midst of the neighbourhood are some open-sky bath places where men, women and children bathe and wash clothes without any privacy. With walls evidently fractured and plaster sloughed off, these buildings were labelled as \"risky\" last year following a massive earthquake. They are to be replaced with new ones, according to the tender notice posted on the DSCC website, but the existing residents worry that they might not be properly rehabilitated.\"We have lived here for generations,\" says Maya Rani Das, a resident. \"And now we fear being evicted.\"  Kiran Das explains that ancestors of all their families once worked for the city corporation and were given the houses in return. But many of the current generation no longer work with the authority. When a cleaner died or was terminated, his descendants did not necessarily replace him, Kiran says, adding that some young Dalits also tend to work in different sectors refusing to adhere to the disparaging ancestral profession. \"But there are talks that those currently not working with DSCC will not be given a place after the construction of new buildings.\" When contacted, Khan Mohammad Bilal, Chief Executive Officer of the DSCC, referred the reporter to the Waste Management Department, which oversees its cleaner employees. Additional Chief Waste Management Officer, Khandker Millatul Islam, confirms the Ganaktuli residents' worst fear.  \"Yes, only those currently working with us will be given a house,\" he tersely states, adding that the tender procedure will be concluded soon. When asked about the rest of the residents, he simply replied, \"We haven't given much thought to the matter.\" While the DSCC says it's yet to make a final list of \"eligible\" workers, data provided by Nagorik Udyog, a leading Dalit rights organisation, estimates that around 200 Hindu Dalit families of Ganaktuli are currently associated with the DSCC, meaning approximately a thousand people are on the course to be evicted. Fighting Back \nZakir Hossain, Chief Executive of Nagorik Udyog, a Dalit rights organisation, who has witnessed many ups and downs of the Dalit community over the years, warns that any such eviction would rip the Dalit community apart.  \"Even if we resettle them, their livelihood will be at stake,\" he says. \"Our so-called \"bhadra samaj\" (elite society) will oppose them. Their daily bread, culture and bonding - everything will be in jeopardy.\" He invoked the eviction from the Mohammadpur Townhall Colony to support his argument. \"They were resettled in Gabtali Beribadh with very little civic facilities, and they have since faced increased discrimination. For example, in my capacity as a joint secretary of an environmental rights group, I received complaints from the local residents who wanted to get rid of the 'dirty' Dalit cleaners. They are not welcome or thought as human beings by many of us.\" A research titled \"Dalits in Bangladesh: Rights and Accessibility to Education\" by Manzurul Islam (et. al.) documented that prior to the eviction, almost 90 percent children of the Mohammadpur Colony used to go to nearby schools. However, after they were settled in Gabtali, a marginal area, only 4-5 students continued their education. In Dhaka, Dalits mainly live in 18 neighbourhoods called \"colonies\" - a term also used to refer to quarters built for government employees. But the two \"colonies\" are drastically different. Government employee colonies occupy huge spaces and come with adequate civic facilities such as water, sanitation, utility, etc., whereas the Dalit colonies are one of the least liveable places in the entire city.  Ganaktuli Colony is one of the largest colonies in Dhaka, housing around 14,000 people of 2,000 families. With increase of population, many of them built single-storey buildings in nearby places, which too are very small. Almost 99 percent of the Dalits are landless, research by Nagorik Udyog shows. \"We all have a homestead in our village,\" says Zakir. \"But they have none.\"  As they were brought in as cleaners or sweepers, municipality or railway authorities in most cases built houses for them in khas or government owned land. Otherwise, they were allowed to live in abandoned government buildings, as were the cases of Ganaktuli or PWD Sweeper Colony, according to a report by Isteaque Mahmud for Equity Watch. Dalits gradually built this community on their own initiatives, with little or no civic facilities provided. Over the years, the government tried to help counter the severe housing crisis, but it was barely adequate. Dalits and 'Untouchability'\nDalits, a term originated from \"Dalita\" or \"oppressed\", in Dhaka city are the descendants of the labourers brought by the British regime during the 19th century from southern Indian states. Since their arrival in Bangladesh, the members of the Dalit community have worked in the tea gardens and performed the dirtiest jobs in the cities such as cleaning, sweeping, handling corpses, etc.  Religiously, they were excluded from the traditional Hindu four-tier varna system, and therefore called and treated as \"untouchables\". In Bangladesh, like India, the Dalits have faced institutional discrimination. Their children are not accepted in mainstream schools, says Sumon Balmiky, a Dalit from Ganaktuli Colony, because \"we are 'jat' (born) sweeper.\" He also says that they are not allowed to worship in Hindu temples other than their own - a claim echoed by many working on Dalit rights. In addition, many members of the Telegu speaking community aren't naturally fluent in Bengali, which has also resulted in their inability to assimilate with mainstream communities. Bangladesh does not have any specific reference or legal framework to address discrimination against Dalits, according to a report by International Dalit Solidarity Network (IDSN). The government is yet to enact a proposed anti-discrimination act, pushed by rights groups, which specifically protects the rights of the Dalits and effectively prohibits the practice of 'untouchability'.  'A vicious cycle'\nWithin the Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) alone, there are at least five thousand registered cleaners and sweepers. Commodore MK Bakhtiar, Chief Waste Management Officer at the DSCC, says that many of the cleaners working under him hail from the Dalit communities. Thousands more are understandably assigned to keep house and buildings clean. Komol Sarkar, a registered cleaner with DSCC, also works at a corporate office in Dhaka. He spent a lifetime cleaning houses and streets, as did his father and grandfather before him. His son last year got a job - also of cleaning - at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. The hereditary nature of the profession begs the question as to why a specific community is stuck doing these jobs for generations. While Komol Sarkar didn't feel the urge to send his son to school, it remains indifferent for those who had. A research report titled \"Dalits in Bangladesh - A study on Deprivation\" by Prof. Mesbah Kamal, Dr. Monirul I. Khan. Dr. Khaleda Islam and Ms. Shereen Khan stated that nearly 72 percent of Dalits sent their children to school, but most them later dropped out. Due to extreme poverty, most Dalit children could not continue their education after the primary level, according to the report. Kids, who hail from the \"sweeper colony\", were documented to have been bullied and disdained by other kids and teachers, resulting in further dropout.  A separate research by Bangladesh Dalit and Excluded Rights Movement (BDERM) and Nagorik Uddyog highlighted the same dropout phenomenon, stating that the primary level dropout rate among Dalit kids was as high as 63 percent as of 2014. Only around four percent of Dalit students completed studying, both reports found. However, even Dalit graduates report of discrimination in the job field, inherently because of their familial occupation and identity. \"When our address is written on our job application that we hail from 'sweeper colony', our application is instantly rejected,\" Johny Das, an activist of Samaj Seba Juba Sangha, says.  \"You can call it a vicious cycle,\" explains Altaf Parvez. \"If you are a sweeper you can't send your kids to school. If you can't send your kids to school, he will become a sweeper like you.\" On the other hand, Dalit jobs in cleaning positions are slowly being taken over by Muslim cleaners. \"Nowadays the job of a cleaner requires Tk. 2-3 lakh,\" alleges Kiran Das. \"Where will our people get this amount of money from?\" A report by The Daily Star titled \"Traditional sweepers face hard time as others take away jobs\" published on February 13, 2008 also documented the phenomenon. \"From 2006 to 2007 DCC recruited around 1,000 cleaners. But only 300 of them were from the Dalit community,\" journalist Shahnaz Parveen reported, citing sources.  Altaf Parvez, an independent researcher who extensively worked on Dalit issues, says, \"Many Muslim cleaners do not do the job by themselves. Instead, they hire a Dalit to do the job for them for low wages.\"  All hope is not lost\nBack at the Ganaktuli Colony, Johny Das and his fellow activists of the Samaj Seba Jubo Sangha club vowed to object eviction. \"We have no choice but stand up.\"  Zakir Hossain is also optimistic that his campaigners would eventually thwart any attempt to evict Dalits from Ganaktuli. In fact, he is quite familiar with this sort of fight.  In 2011, Dalits in Agargaon PWD Sweeper Colony received an eviction notice. A few days later nearly 500,000 men and women under the banner of Bangladesh Dalit and Excluded Rights Movement (BDERM), of which Zakir is an advisor, Bangladesh Dalit Human Rights (BDHR) and Dalit Women Forum held human chains and demonstrations demanding withdrawal of the notice and safe housing for the people of the colony. Within the next week, they were assured that they would not be evicted.  \"I'm already under pressure from locals of Ganaktuli to do something,\" he acknowledges. \"If the government formally notifies people of any eviction, we will show up as we did back in 2011. They are bound to retreat.\" Nazmul Ahasan is a freelance journalist. He can be reached at nazmulahasan@live.com. \n"

      "text": "After a captivating five days of Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) cricket, fans in Sylhet will return to their usual mundane lives without the slightest knowledge of another sporting festival for the foreseeable future. The sport-loving fans in the eastern headquarters of the country made it quite an occasion when the glamorous domestic T20 competition hit the city for the first time. They turned up in droves to every game and cheered their home team Sylhet Sixers, who also made memorable a debut in the fifth edition of the slam-bang T20 competition. The banners and posters of the seven participating teams, which are on display on the streets of the city, might be there for another few days. But the most disappointing aspect is that there is nothing on offer from the local organisers for any domestic cricket or football event round the year, let alone any international tournament. The last time a major sporting event was held in Sylhet was the SAFF Under-16 football tournament last year, which also generated huge enthusiasm. But since then there has not been much to talk about and there were hardly any activities from the local organisers to arrange leagues and tournaments regularly. Interestingly, the two main venues -- the Sylhet District Stadium and the Sylhet International Stadium -- are destined to remain idle throughout the year. The First Division Cricket League started in March this year after a gap of two years. Unfortunately, it is yet to be completed. The First Division Football League was last held in 2014. Here everything is arranged on ad-hoc basis. The district sports association has an ad-hoc committee, which has been running the show since 2014. Funnily, it is to yet form a full-fledged committee. Sylhet produced some fine cricketers and footballers in the past but the lack of domestic competitions has virtually stopped the flow of young talents. \"Players only played three matches in the league, which is not sufficient for them. The league must be arranged with enough time and in a proper way for the betterment of the game,\" lamented Rezaul Karim Nachon, president of the Sylhet Cricketer's Association. He also said that the age-level cricket of Sylhet is dependent on the academies, owing to which the player selection has been centralised when it needs to be open for all players. According to former Bangladesh captain Rajin Saleh, who is also a local boy, efforts from the local organisers are few and far between to groom the grassroots players. \"I think it's the cricketing activities, not the infrastructure, that needs to improve in Sylhet and I think there is hardly any drive from the authorities to make that happen,\" Rajin told The Daily Star yesterday. When contacted, Mahi Uddin Ahmed Selim, general secretary of Sylhet District Sports Association, said that having only one stadium meant that they could not arrange leagues for any sport. \"There is only one stadium in Sylhet where we arrange cricket, football, hockey and all others sports which is creating a huge pressure to arrange the leagues be it cricket or football,\" Selim said. \"We arranged school cricket last year at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium. If the authority allows us to arrange the cricket league in the divisional stadium, we can arrange football at the district Stadium\", he added. \"I took a day off from work to watch the BPL game today as we hardly have any sporting events here in Sylhet. We don't even have any domestic games in Sylhet which is frustrating,\" said Abul Kalam, a car mechanic by profession."

      "text": "Amit Chakma was only three when the construction of Kaptai dam ended in 1962. The dam, meant to generate hydroelectric power, eventually caused flood in nearby areas, submerging a large swath of his family land. Like them, many other families in Rangamati lost farmland, the main source of their income. With the land gone and livelihood disrupted, Amit's father realised that only education could turn things around for the ethnic minority people in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The journey since has been long and difficult, but Amit has translated his father's dream into reality. At 58, he is now president and vice-chancellor of University of Western Ontario, one of the oldest and prominent universities in Canada. Now in Dhaka to attend the 50th convocation of Dhaka University as the convocation speaker, he spoke to The Daily Star yesterday about his pursuit of education and his thoughts about his homeland and his community. \"Behind every success, there needs to have a motivation ... Why did I pursue education? Our lands went under water; there was no other means to earn a living. There was no alternative but education.\" Eldest among four siblings, he considers himself lucky to have parents with certain level of education who understood the value of education. His father, Prabhat Chakma, went to study in a university in Calcutta at a time when very few from his community even thought of leaving home for education. But as the World War-II broke, Prabhat returned home without completing his studies and joined government services. Amit's mother, Alo Chakma, was a primary schoolteacher. She often visits him in Canada. \"Right from our childhood, they instilled the value for education in us,\" said Amit, who authored more than 100 articles and is an expert in areas related to petroleum research and energy management. After the construction of the dam, many families resettled in remote areas of the district, but his father chose to live in the town so he could send his children to school. When Amit was in class five, his father sent him to Ispahani School in Comilla and his sister to Tangail's Bharateswari Homes for better education. However, in the wake of the 1969 mass uprising, Amit returned home and completed his secondary education from Rangamati Government High School. He passed his higher secondary exam from Dhaka College in 1976, when unrest was brewing up in the hills. Uncertain if he could return home, he started to look for a scholarship abroad. \"If the situation in the hills were stable and peaceful, my natural tendency would be that I would go back home,\" he said. But he soon got a scholarship from the Algerian government in 1977 to study chemical engineering at Algerian Petroleum Institute. He graduated at the top of his class in 1982. He then moved to Canada and earned his master's in applied science and PhD in chemical engineering from the University of British Columbia in 1984 and 1987 respectively. He began his academic career as a professor of chemical and petroleum engineering at the University of Calgary where he taught from 1988 to 1996. Subsequently, he joined the University of Regina as dean of engineering and later served as its vice-president (research) from 1999 to 2001. During this time, he made it to Canada's Top 40 Under 40 list. He then became vice-president (academic and provost) at the University of Waterloo in 2001. In 2009, he joined the University of Western Ontario as its 10th president and VC. Amit said he had been able to overcome all odds and disadvantages of being someone from an ethnic minority community only because of education. \"Education is the best tool to ensure social justice.\" No country is perfect, he says, but the nations that value merits over social status and uphold the rule of law will see progress. \"We are now living in a situation where knowledge is more important than anything else. The nations that put priority on knowledge have developed themselves.\" About the education system in Canada and Bangladesh, he said the overall quality of Canadian education system was good as the standard of educational institutions was more or less the same. \"But the education system in Bangladesh has vulcanised. Here the quality of one school to another varies greatly,\" he said. He added that teachers in the past used to treat teaching as their vocation, not a mere profession. \"Now I have come to know that the level of dedication and devotion in many of the teachers has dropped.\" Also, corruption in teachers' recruitment process is another big problem. \"Corruption in education sector is extremely dangerous. \"For example, if a bridge breaks apart, it can be repaired with money. But if a generation is imparted substandard education, it takes several generations to fix it.\" There are many good educational institutions Bangladesh but there should be an effort to build many more. \"Many Bangladeshi students are studying in universities abroad, including in my university, and doing well.\" He suggested striving for overall quality. \"If you believe that a country's economic prosperity depends on knowledge, you will have to try to be very good at what you do. Quality of education and quality of research should be world class. It may be hard to do but you have to keep trying.\" About his community in the CHT, Amit said despite some progress, the hill people still live in miseries. Unfortunately, successive governments have had many outsiders settled in the hills out of political motivation, which creates problems there, he said. He said he saw many youths from the region working in Chittagong and other areas. \"They are going for economic reasons. Similarly, if people go to hill areas for economic purposes, I don't see any problem. But if people go there for political reasons, then there would be problem. \"Instead of sending settlers, send tourists there. Develop infrastructure and other facilities for promoting tourism,\" he said, adding that the CHT, Cox's Bazar and the Sundarbans are the country's natural assets where tourism should be promoted. He suggested making good use of the country's natural resources and human resources as well as ensuring rule of law. His university job apart, Amit sometimes plays the role of an \"unofficial ambassador\" of Bangladesh in Canada. \"Many are curious about Bangladesh and when they ask me about the country with a negative impression, I tell them that despite many problems this country has made huge progress on all counts. \"I tell them about the rise in literacy rate and the MDGs [which the country has achieved] and other achievements. Then they get to know about us. \"I'm happy to play this role,\" Amit added, with a smile."

      "text": "According to a gazette notification issued in 2015, around 15sqkm area, from the Jaflong-Dawki river flowing into Bangladesh at the border with India to the edge of Sari-Gowainghat river, is Ecologically Critical Area (ECA). Any kind of stone extraction or economic activity that could affect the area's environment was restricted. A 2012 High Court order that asked the government to issue the gazette also asked to stop the use of such excavators, locally known as \"boma machines\", and other earthmoving equipment in the area. The court had directed the government to remove all such machines to protect Jaflong's eco-system, biodiversity, and the livelihoods of people living along the rivers. General Secretary Abdul Karim Kim of Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon, Sylhet chapter, said the ECA also covers the entire Khasipunji area up to the Pyain river, including 500 metres on both sides of the river. \"But the stone extraction, crushing, and dumping are going on unabated,\" he said. During a visit, The Daily Star correspondent saw that the picturesque hills of the area were being systematically devoured by excavators for stone extraction on a large scale. The noise made by the machines could be heard from a long distance away. The indiscriminate stone lifting was hurting the adjacent Jafflong Tea Company Ltd. Authorities of the estate have requested the local administration to take necessary steps to protect their estate from the destructive activities, said sources in the company. Chief Executive Abdul Hye Al-Hadi of Save the Heritage and Environment said more than 100 such stone extracting machines were being used by the so-called stone traders, allegedly in collusion with the local administration, ruling party men, and even journalists. Amid the indifference of the authorities concerned, stone lifters recently set up some crushers on the riverside hills of Noya Bosti and Kando Bosti, all inside the ECA. Stones collected by the \"boma machines\" are being crushed there and then sent to different parts of the country for use in construction. Villagers of Noya Bosti and Kando Bosti, tired of the noise and seeing the destruction of their neighbourhoods before their eyes, submitted a petition to the Sylhet deputy commissioner on August 31 asking for steps. \"But we are helpless,\" said Fokrul Islam, a signatory of the petition. \"There is no sign of improvement of the situation although we have appealed repeatedly to the authorities concerned.\" According to the villagers, the stone lifters had the blessings of influential people and ruling party leaders. Consequently, goons were threatening the locals for lodging complaints against the stone lifters.  Local UP member Ataur Rahman Atai claimed that he was put behind bars under a false case because he protested the illegal stone extraction. Asked about the villagers' petition, Deputy Commissioner Rahat Anwar of Sylhet said the authorities were aware of the illegal activity. \"Sometimes we conduct drives against the boma machines. We call upon the locals to come forward and help the administration in preventing such illegal acts,\" he said. Sylhet Coordinator of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela) Shaheda Begam told The Daily Star that years had gone by since the High Court directive and the gazette notification but the ECA had not been implemented properly. Gowainghat upazila AL unit President Mohammad Ibrahim said there was no denying that illegal stone extraction was going on in Jaflong. The party condemns such activities, he said, adding that local ruling party activists in Jaflong could be involved in such acts and that he would take punitive actions if specific allegations were brought against a party man.

There are 1,10,520 large and small commercial cattle farms in the region, of which, 33,155 are in Rangpur and 17,586 in Nilphamari. Around 5.7 lakh cattle, including 1,76,125 goats and sheep, are being reared at these farms, he added. There are more than one lakh cattle surplus in Rangpur region, so there will no shortage of sacrificial animals this year, Faruk said. Rafiqul Islam, a cow farmer of Kamalpur village under Sadar upazila, said he is rearing 10 cows and fattening them the natural way. Traders are already communicating with him to buy his cows, he added. \"Dependence on Indian cattle must go,\" Rafiqul said, adding that they are expecting good profit, but traders could suffer huge losses if sacrificial animals come from India. Buying and selling at cattle markets are yet to gain momentum due to the flood, farmers said. Traders said prices of sacrificial animals could be high due to shortage of fodder caused by excessive rain and flood in the region. Selim Uddin of Shakhati village under Kaliganj upazila of Lalmonirhat said he spent Tk 20,000 in the last two months for fodder for one cow, adding that he has been rearing it for seven months using natural fattening method. \"I have got an offer of Tk 90,000 for the cow,\" he added. Mizanur Rahman of Kaunia upazila of Rangpur said some people are allegedly using pills for fattening their cows. He urged the local administration to look into the matter. Joynal Abedin of Nilphamari Sadar and Fazlul Haq of Kaliganj upazila of Lalmonirhat said rearing cost has gone up this year due to the high price of fodder. If cattle come from India, their dream of good profit will be destroyed, he added. DD Faruk said his office is working round the clock to ensure healthy cattle for this festival, adding that field level officials are working to prevent use of cattle fattening pills. Commanding Officer of Joypurhat BGB-20 Battalion Lt Col Imtiaz Choudhury said smugglers along the border districts are becoming active to bring cow fattening pills from India illegally, adding that members of Joypurhat and Dinajpur Border Guard Bangladesh seized nearly 5 lakh pills in the last two months.

      "text": "The price of rice at importer level came down by Tk 2.50 per kg as the latest duty cut became effective yesterday following issuance of a circular by the National Board of Revenue (NBR). According to the circular, the rice import tariff was lowered from 10 percent to two percent. The move came a day after a cabinet committee meeting decided to cut the import duty to keep the rice price stable. Chitta Majumder, a rice importer, said their cost of rice import from India would come down to Tk 35.50 to Tk 36 from Tk 38 to Tk 38.50 a kg under the new tax rate. Prices of coarse rice would come down below Tk 40 per kg within two to three days due to a cascading effect of the tax cut, Chitta, proprietor of Majumder Traders, told The Daily Star yesterday. The retail prices of coarse rice shot up to Tk 47-48 in June-July, a 47 percent increase from last year's price band of Tk 30-34. However, the prices later stabilised at Tk 43-45, according to data of Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. The importer said they had been waiting for over a week on the announcement of the tax cut. He hoped rice prices would ease as about 20,000 to 25,000 tonnes of rice would be imported in the next four or five days. Flashfloods in six northeastern haor districts and fungal attacks (rice blast) in 19 others during the Boro season damaged about 20 lakh tonnes of rice crop earlier this year. At least 20 northern districts and some others elsewhere in the country have been hit by flood in the last few days. Against this backdrop, the cabinet committee meeting at the secretariat on Wednesday approved the government's decision to import 20 lakh tonnes of food grains -- 15 lakh tonnes of rice and 5 lakh tonnes of wheat -- in the current fiscal year. The revised import target is 11 lakh tonnes more than the government's earlier projected food import volume of 9 lakh tonnes.   Yesterday's duty cut was the second this year after the government in June had slashed the rice import duty to 10 percent from 28 percent.  Under the new duty structure, importers will have to pay only Tk 1.56 crore instead of Tk 7.82 crore in tariff for releasing 24,000 tonnes of rice stuck at several ports. Chitta Majumder said 15 lakh tonnes of rice was being imported by the government. Local importers could bring the rice into Darshana, Khulna at quickest time, he told this correspondent. The government has so far floated international tenders seeking to buy 3.5 tonnes of rice. Local importers, said Chitta, had supplied rice to the government in 2009 promptly. If the government floated local tenders, the importers would have been able to import rice from India and reach it to government granaries, he added. Rice importers started clearing customs at Hili Land Port in Dinajpur's Hakimpur upazila yesterday. They also started unloading rice, imported from India, from trucks that reached the port 12 days ago. Around 600 trucks carrying 18,000 tonnes of rice had been stranded at the port since August 5 when the importers stopped clearing customs in anticipation of a duty cut. Rice was unloaded from 400 trucks yesterday, said Moshiur Rahman Mondal, assistant commissioner of customs at the port."

And every time after a little shower, the city's traffic system totally collapses. Waterlogging in Dhaka has become a common problem during monsoon. Rainwater is carried through natural canals and large concrete pipes to flood plains and rivers, but as most of the canals have been grabbed by the encroachers or clogged with solid wastes, the city streets are submerged even after a little rain. Moreover, according to experts, the city's storm-water drainage system is inadequate and is only capable of dealing with 20mm of rainfall and the streets get waterlogged if the rainfall exceeds 40mm. So, Dhaka needs a complete drainage network in which the canals, water retention areas, flood plains and rivers would collect, carry and retain rainwater and will be connected with each other. According to the Flood Action Plan and DAP, the city should have 5,523 acres of conserved water retention areas, 20,093 acres of canals and rivers, and 74,598 acres of flood flow zones. But according to experts, most of these wetlands have been filled up. Immediate action needs to be taken to reclaim the lost floodplains and canals, otherwise the situation will keep worsening. It is the duty of the city authorities to clean up the clogged drains and canals and rescue the water bodies inside the city from the land grabbers. The Dhaka City Corporations and Dhaka Wasa have to do their development works in coordination with each other. But what is most important is the implementation of the Dhaka's Detailed Area Plan (DAP) if we want a permanent solution to this problem."

      "text": "It is often said that \"sorry\" is the hardest word to say. If that is true, then \"thank you\" may come as a close second. As I stood at the back of the queue in a food court recently, I noticed that there were at least a dozen customers standing in line before me. As they walked up to the counter one by one to collect their food, most of them had their eyes glued to their mobile phones, and few of them looked up until they were served. The most glaring observation was that not a single person replied to the greetings of the server, who said \"thank you\" to them. It was as if the servers did not exist, and the transaction had a mechanical feel to it. Living as we do in an age of sophisticated technology and where everything we touch and feel seems smooth and seamless, human contact seems to be rarer than ever. Yet the experience at the food court was not the first, nor was it an isolated case: I see this neglect or avoidance of human contact everywhere, in every country I visit these days; and it cannot be said to be an \"Eastern\" or \"Western\" phenomenon. It seems instead to be a symptom of the age we live in, where human interaction seems burdensome, a thing to be avoided if possible. Avoiding human interaction is not new, of course. From the 19th century, people have noted how human beings chose to hide behind their newspapers while taking public transport, and even then, we bemoaned the end of human communication. But compounding matters today has been the manner in which technology has made it easier for us to avoid actual human contact--notwithstanding the often bandied about claim that modern communications technology has connected people the world over. So are we connected but not communicating? It is undeniable that present-day communications technology in its myriad of forms has brought individuals and communities together. But that does not mean that we are any closer to meaningful human communication or dealing with the differences between us. By now, it is equally clear that communications technology and social media have not created a complex world of differences but, rather, contributed to the emergence of closed in-group communities made up of like-minded individuals who seek similarity rather than complexity. Analysts have noted how the rise of ethno-nationalist movements, hard-right extremist groups and militant organisations thrive on the insecurity and isolation of individuals, and how like-minded people can congregate virtually in cyberspace to affirm their commonalities while denying the identities of others. Rather than opening up the minds of people, the Internet can and has provided a safe haven for those who seek to confirm their biases; and those biases can range from the denial of climate change to the denial of the identity and history of other communities they happen not to like. This has been--and will perhaps always be--the problem that lies in the use of technology itself. For no matter how sophisticated a communication platform may be--no matter how fast, how seamless, how convenient or cheap--it cannot somehow compel the user to want to engage with other human beings. Simply put, technology cannot make us love our fellow human beings, and cannot compel us to say \"thank you\" to someone who has done us a favour. Such behaviour, whether genuine or normative, stems from our social education and conditioning (parents, school, friends), but it also presupposes that we are social beings in the first place, who recognise the common humanity we share with others. Those who bemoan technology's impact on the dehumanisation of society are often chided for being technophobes or Luddites at heart, but I would argue that such dismissals miss the point. Few would argue with the benefits of modern medicine, or decline the offer of anaesthetics that would make a visit to the dentist less painful. We still choose to fly when we can as no one would walk all the way to Europe as a sign of protest against technology. But what is worrying for some is how certain forms of technology can and have been used to dehumanise the Other, and allow us to negate the complex realities of human co-existence. Video games are perhaps the most notorious culprits in this case, and scores of critics have written about how many games continue to glorify violence, machismo and misogyny on a daily basis. Worse still, there exist the so-called \"Dark Net\" games that are truly dark in nature, featuring torture and wanton slaughter as \"entertainment\". And by now, we have all seen how social media can be manipulated to produce desired outcomes that have nothing to do with simple human contact and communication, but rather to flood the public domain with fake news, hate speech and normalised bigotry--all with serious sociopolitical consequences that are borne by society in the long run. Those of us who work on the domain of political violence know very well how it is never accidental or contingent; and that long before pogroms and riots occur, there is always an enormous amount of stage-setting that has to take place where targeted victims--be they individuals or communities--are singled out as potential targets first. Part and parcel of this process of targeting is the practice of dehumanisation: where the Other is cast as somehow less-than-human, and deserving hate. This has been the case in all the conflicts that have blighted humanity but, today, this process of dehumanisation has been amplified thanks to communications technology and social media. The question that should perhaps be asked is this: Rather than try to turn the clock back and attempt to retreat to some Luddite fantasy land, can we imagine ways by which technology can be harnessed to serve human and humane ends instead? A \"humane turn\" can be seen in other industries such as mining, oil and gas, and agriculture: We have come to understand that environmental degradation is as much a responsibility of companies as it is the responsibility of consumers and, as such, their practices are regulated for the public good. An oil company that pollutes the environment, for instance, would be expected to be fined and made to clean up the mess it made. Likewise, agricultural companies that cause massive forest fires are today expected to heal the land that they have scarred. But in the domain of social media and communications technology--where the social cost of abuse can be greater, and borne by people--there seems to be little regulation of the same kind. Over the past decade, there had been enough reports of political conflicts and crises that were fanned by fake news sites, malicious content providers and so on, to show that social media can be used for the sake of hate campaigns. While it would be difficult to control everything that happens in this ever-expanding virtual realm, surely imaginative incentives can be thought up, to encourage the development of more humane and people-friendly uses of social media and communications technology? At some point, our thinking about technology has to take on board these concerns, for if technology does not serve a humane end, then what is its point anyway? And for those of us who are concerned about security, violence in the public domain, and the question of social resilience, let us remember that such concerns only make sense when there is a society to speak of. A world where people would rather speak to apps and phones is one where human communication has become secondary, and when such human bonds are weakened, conflict and distrust are often close at hand.

      "text": "\"A few grains of rice can make all the difference\"- such is the motto of BhaatBank, a registered non-profit organisation working to end hunger by providing free meals to the less fortunate. Where more than 32 percent of our population still live under the poverty line, we all arguably have a moral responsibility to try to mitigate the hunger that comes with poverty. The prevalence of child malnutrition in Bangladesh is 33 percent, one of the highest in the world. BhaatBank was founded by Hasnain Syed and Ayesha Ahsan from USA, joined by Mohammad Hassan and Mohammed Wahiduzzaman from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Along the way, Nadia Sarker and other passionate members have joined together to end hunger for single mothers like Rehana, widowed, with three small children, struggling for meals. BhaatBank is for small girls like Rita, who no longer have to collect the thrown away rice from the floor of bazaar for a meal. The organisation runs completely on donations, and is currently providing 1200 free and freshly cooked meals per month to the ones in need. \"This is not a hand out, and nor are we doing this to earn any social 'brownie points'. We simply want to help those who are unable to provide for themselves and their family a proper square meal, even after toiling over a hard day of labour. BhaatBank services are not limited to just donating food from our donation centers in our city,\" says Nadia Sarker. At the moment, the organisation operates in Mohammadpur and plans to expand to other areas soon. The philanthropic activities of the organisation is not limited to food, as during the recent flood crisis in North Bengal, BhaatBank and their volunteers reached out to the flood victims in Sirajganj and provided 250 families with care packages consisting of one week worth of food and medicine supplies. The ultimate goal, however, is that no one in the city should sleep hungry. As Mother Teresa once said, \"If you can't feed a hundred people, feed just one.\"   If you want to donate to this noble cause or volunteer, you can log in at: www.bhaatbank.org "

He studied at Ithaca College in New York and graduated with a degree in Business Administration in 2007. After working for a non-for-profit cooperative bank in the US, he returned to Bangladesh and gained experience working at Waste Concern and Yunus Center. Islam is also a classically trained musician, and at Yale, he is currently working with a composer to juxtapose the ill effects of climate change and music. We at SHOUT spoke to this inspiring individual, who encourages Bangladeshi students to think outside the box of working for corporations and to open their minds to accept other forms of work in academia. SHOUT: What inspired you to study about the environment?\nIslam: I was greatly fascinated by the words of wisdom on the environment from past leaders. The great British Philosopher John Stuart Mill in his book \"Principles of Political Economy\" wrote that we should sacrifice economic growth for the environment. I also remember reading Indira Gandhi's famous speech during the 1972 Stockholm Conference on Human Environment where nations gathered to talk about environmental issues. It was there that she famously brought to light the perils of the world's poor. She asked \"Are not poverty and need the greatest polluters?\" In 1972, it was a brave and novel statement for the world arena focused more on the wealth of nations. This statement resonated with me to explore more about what it exactly meant both academically and professionally. SHOUT: How would you address the effects of climate change in Bangladesh?\nIslam: It is important to note that despite the natural disasters and the myriad juxtaposition of social, economic and environmental issues, the people of Bangladesh have proved to be resilient and adaptable. The country has moved forward. However, we cannot be complacent with existing environmental policies and its implementation because problems grow exponentially. We must put our energy on technology and knowledge transfer with nations, such as the Netherlands which has done exceptionally well to keep sea water out. For example, we can focus more on coastal cross-dams and forestation projects, among other solutions. Second, the government should continue research on saline and drought resistant crops to increase food security. Third, we should focus efforts to training of people to adapt to changing climate through alternative livelihood management. Finally, it is important to note that overt gentrification, as we see in Dhaka, puts a colossal pressure on our infrastructure and the policies must be changed and enforced to reduce unplanned urbanisation. SHOUT: Tell us about your academic experiences and how it has shaped you as a person fighting against climate change.\nIslam: I was greatly influenced by Professor Todd Stern, my teacher at Yale. He was the top climate change diplomat for both the Obama and the Clinton administrations and pushed the north versus south issues forward. Without his immaculate strides, along with the push from developing countries, the COP21 in Paris may have ended up in a stalemate. Professor Harold Koh (former legal advisor to the US State Department) was also critical in helping me shape my knowledge on global law challenges. Furthermore, scholarly Professor Mizan R. Khan and Professor Nurul Amin in Bangladesh helped me to wrap my head around complex climate change issues.  SHOUT: Besides the environment, what are some of your other interests? \nIslam: I really enjoy working on projects that connect seemingly disconnected items. I studied western classical music in the US and proudly performed with my school at Lincoln Center and various concert halls. I often dream of putting my background in music in contrast with my innate passion to preserve nature. Thus, I spent my summer at Yale with a composer, writing lyrics for a 3-part song cycle depicting environmental issues and I hope to have it performed in the near future. Music is a wonderful medium to spread a unifying message to those listening, just go to a club and see how people are completely in tune with each other, moving in harmony. In an analogy, music has inspired generations and we need more of such in the world in disseminating environmental issues.  SHOUT: What message do you have for the youth?\nIslam: An important element to remember is that the environment is vastly interdisciplinary. One can be interested in engineering, architecture, economics, business, and even music and theatre as vehicles for information dissemination. Therefore, the future career possibilities are endless. No matter where one finds inspiration, it can be developed and applied to the exponentially increasing arena of environmental studies. Gone are the days of \"boxed-in\" academia. If you need to build the next flood barrier, you need both architects and engineers, but prior to that you need policy makers and environmental impact assessment specialists to see how the flora and fauna will be affected, business leaders and entrepreneurs to invest in such projects and journalists and the media to cover these critical stories. We need health specialists and scientists to research more as vector-borne diseases move further up north, agriculturists researching on the next saline and drought resistant crops.  Students should be active participants in climate related projects. Back in Bangladesh, I was deeply involved in the HSBC-The Daily Star Climate Awards twice through an organisation called Waste Concern, run by two Ashoka & Schwab Foundation Fellows, which is an example of a place where students can choose to intern. Finally, can you imagine the joy seeing this country as a global hub to incubate the next big idea? Solutions to existential needs such as potable water, air quality, rising sea levels can bring positive, critical shifts in the equilibrium. In order for this to happen, I highly encourage more students to take environmental courses in school and college for you may be the next big leader, taking our world towards a better future for all.

      "text": "People in Ulipur upazila of the district are suffering as the Buri Teesta river is drying up due to earth filling at a place where a sluice gate collapsed in 1988. The Buri Teesta originates from the Teesta river at Arjun village and joins the Brahmaputra river at Kachkol village under Chilmari upazila. Flow of water in the 30-km-long river through Ulipur municipality area used to be controlled through two regulators (sluice gates) of Water Development Board (WDB) at Arjun and Kachkol villages. WDB stopped flow of water by filling earth when the sluice gate at Arjun village collapsed during the flood in 1988. From then, the branch river started losing its depth and water-carrying capacity, and is almost dead now. Freedom fighter Abu Bakar Siddik, 70, of Khearpar village, said, \"Water would flow freely in the Buri Teesta about 20 years ago. Before liberation, the people of Roumari and Rajibpur upazilas would come to Ulipur Bazar for marketing and transporting all kinds of goods by boat. Boat races were held every year, and there were plenty of fish in the river.\" \"Due to lack of flow, the river got filled up slowly with silt coming from upstream during the rainy season. Some people have constructed houses by raising the riverbed. Vast tracts of crops get damaged during flood or heavy downpour,\" Abu Bakar said.   \"Dredging of the Buri Teesta and construction of the sluice gate are needed to save the ecology and produce crops by reviving the water flow,\" he added.   Abdul Aziz, 65, of Jotdarpara village, said, \"I would cultivate jute and get it rotten in the river, but I cannot do it now. The riverbed was dredged for irrigation by the government about 37 years ago. It is still possible to revive the river if it is dredged again.\" Parimol Majumdar, an activist of 'Save Buri Teesta-save Ulipur' movement, said, \"We are agitating against grabbing of the Buri Teesta. We also want dredging of the river and reconstruction of the sluice gate.\" \"We have formed human chains and held bicycle rallies in Ulipur to demand restoration of flow of water in the Buri Teesta, and submitted a memorandum to the Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO),\" Porimol said. Executive Engineer of WDB in Kurigram Shafiqul Islam, said, \"Digging of ditches and construction of embankments in different districts will be started this year. An eight kilometre area in Kurigram has already been taken under the project. Besides, a separate project for the Buri Teesta will be placed to the higher authorities. If the local lawmaker assists me, the project may be approved quickly.\"  UNO Shafiqul Islam said, \"I have received a letter on the Buri Teesta from the villagers and have taken some steps. I have asked the assistant commissioner (land) to mark the area of Buri Teesta according to CS and SA land records. The meeting of Kurigram district river protection committee under the National River Protection Commission has taken a decision on the Buri Teesta and requested the local WDB authority to look into it as there are some lands of the WDB there.\" \"We will take steps against the land grabbers in the Buri Teesta after marking the river area,\" the UNO said.

During a recent visit to Dariyapur market in Gaibandha Sadar, this correspondent found that the fish are being sold at high price. \"I cannot purchase small local fishes due to high price, so I have to buy fish cultivated in ponds at low cost\", said Kamrul Islam, a petty trader of Dariyapur. The local fish are being sold at Tk 600 to Tk 700 per kilogram. This year local fish are visible in the markets but they were not available. Everyday huge quantities of local fish are coming from the rivers, canals and marshy lands, as water level continued to decrease at the advent of winter season and the fish traders are getting profit beyond expectation, said Mostaq Ali, a wholesale fish trader in Dariyapur bazar. This time, huge quantities of hilsa are also found in Jamuna and Brahmaputra basins and the fish is being sold at Tk 400 to Tk 500 per kilogram, he said. Flood damaged crops, but also helped to increase breeding of local fish. This time many local varieties of fish are seen in the markets, which were scanty last year, said Abdud Daiyan, district fishery officer."

      "text": "Sometimes the best technology comes from the past. Floating seedbeds are a traditional agricultural method used in parts of Barisal for many generations. Recently the farming system has been introduced to Kishoreganj. There, farmers in the haor wetland areas are struggling to cope with unusually high water levels resulting from this year's flooding. Floating seedbeds are proving invaluable in helping farmers to adapt. \"I have prepared two floating seedbeds,\" says Mollick Mia, a farmer from Sekepara village in Kotiadi upazila. \"It cost around Tk 1,000 to carry the mud for the beds. I have planted vegetables and so far the seedlings are healthier than the ones grown in the usual way.\" Landless farmer Fayez Uddin from Chang Sholaki village in Kishoreganj Sadar upazila has also adopted the system. \"I started with a floating vegetable garden this year,\" he says, \"and the vegetables are growing really well.\" The benefits of floating seedbeds are potentially even greater with respect to Aman rice crops. In the haor areas it is often difficult for farmers to prepare regular seedbeds in time for the Aman season, due to excess water. The floating beds, made of banana plants, mud and rotten hyacinth have the potential to ensure Aman seedlings are ready for transplanting in time, when regular paddy fields are no longer fully submerged. \"Aman saplings are in high demand in Kishoreganj,\" says farmer and neighbour, Dulal Mia. \"These could also be grown commercially on the floating seedbeds for good profits.\" \"With the support of agriculture department officials,\" says Mongol Mia, another farmer from Kotiadi upazila, \"I am thinking of trying cultivation of Aman rice as well as vegetables on floating seedbeds from next year.\" According to the Department of Agriculture Extension, as many as 67 Kishoreganj farmers across eight upazilas have prepared 146 floating seedbeds this year, with Aman seeds provided for free under the environment ministry's 'Climate Change Agriculture' project. The seedlings grown on floating beds take only twenty days to be ready for transplanting, a process that would require up to thirty days in a regular farm field. \"During the rainy season farmers in Kishoreganj usually have very little work,\" says Kotiadi upazila's sub-assistant agriculture officer Mohammad Moezuddin. \"The floating beds have changed that. They are being used to grow vegetables and spices prior to the Aman paddy season, and because the hyacinth in the beds is good manure, farming on floating seedbeds does not require chemical fertiliser.\" \"Floating seedbeds have commercial potential in flood-prone areas right across greater Mymensingh,\" says Dilruba Yasmin, the agriculture officer in Kishoreganj Sadar upazila. \"This technology could provide work for many landless farmers and other unemployed locals.\""

      "text": "For years, dining out has been the go-to option for friends and family in the metropolitan city of Dhaka. However, the recent trend has been not only to eat but to live a little lavishly for some, pampering themselves to take respite from the hustle and bustle of daily life. Although 'Bangla Chinese' remains a favourite and the First World continues to flood Dhaka with their lower-middle class targeting brands, people have begun asking for more. Whilst dining with a group of friends comprising of the biggest food lovers in town, the question of fine-dining came up. In between mouthfuls of the most delicious salmon ever cooked, prepared by Aroyee, a picture of the Bangladeshi urban culinary scene was painted. Kanishka Chakraborty, a famous food-blogger, resident food lover and a regular columnist for Star Lifestyle expressed his disdain. \"The fine-dining industry can be said to be have regressed,\" he said. He pointed out the fact that the fine-dining restaurants did not go the distance in fine-dining, restricting themselves to oft-times a hastily put together menu. \"There is a problem in the kind of chefs available; there aren't enough good chefs,\" Phillip Choudhury, the Head Chef and Creative Director of Aroyee added. Both points were true. While the restaurant industry has come a long way, a 5-star dining experience is still hard to come about. Even though the concept is being promoted, many fine-dining experiences are hardly what they try to be and the lack of trained or informed chefs does not do the whole \"ordeal\" any justice. Shaila Rahman, Managing Director, Quay Asia Ltd (Bangladesh) pointed out that the fine-dining experience isn't just about eating fancy food outside. There was much more to it. The food, the service, the ambience and a lot more played an equally important part. As one of the co-founders of Aroyee, her expertise was unquestionable. Aroyee, a fine-dining experience, leaves no stone unturned in their pursuit for perfection. Menus are custom-designed for each individual order. The meals are made from the best and freshest materials sourced directly. Your menu card consists of each item in your dining course and comes especially inscribed with your name. The tables are set to a certain standard too; different kinds of forks, knives and spoons set on the right and left, along with different glasses for different drinks. At Aroyee, you feel pampered; you feel special. The chef is known to come out to explain the menu or item prepared, explaining the choice of ingredients and what your taste buds are to expect. Every part of your dining-experience is catered to. Aroyee can be reached at life@aroyee.com. The notion of fine-dining is relatively new but it is an experience that must be tried by those who can afford it. Family outings are now being planned, keeping fine-dining in mind. Dressing up your sharpest and taking your kids out, who are equally looking dapper, to a meal to remember is fast becoming a trend in the city. Capitalising on this, a number of restaurants have either opened up or repackaged themselves, highlighting the luxury aspect of eating there. Armed with a discernable palate, an appetite and a nose for the classy, the Dhaka crowd sets out for these restaurants on most weekends. But while the options are seemingly endless, the wrong choice can make a mess of your entire plans. Imagine going to a fancy restaurant all dressed up to have a number of dishes piled on your table with that annoying jazz music in the background. Restaurants that have been playing the same tunes since 1996 are a dead giveaway to what you are about to get. The other such signs are old looking plates, dirty tablecloths and a menu that promises all kinds of cuisine. The best option is to get recommendations. 3 Dragons at Pearl is touted as being a go to destination for this kind of a gourmet treat. Authentic oriental food is combined with an expert chef, an original ambience and an excellent service. The food is just as you would imagine befitting such a good restaurant and rest assured, you will come out satisfied. While there aren't specific courses designed, if you are going to opt for fine-dining, you might as well know how to order: finger food, appetiser, main course, dessert. Or you can add a second main course, some juice to work as palate cleanser and go crazy with the set up. Remember, it's not always what you eat that makes it fine-dining, but how you eat it. 3 Dragons at Pearl is located at Rangs Pearl Tower, House 72, 12 Rd No 12, Dhaka 1213, Bangladesh. Lotus Etang is another restaurant making a name for itself. Pan-Asian cuisine at its finest, while the restaurant is relatively new, it comes highly recommended. Kaniska - or KC, as he is affectionately called by his friends - gives this restaurant his much-coveted stamp of approval. He riddles his description of the place with a ton of complimentary adjectives. Those who have been, also return pleased with what is on offer. Lotus Etang is located at 23 South Avenue Bay Building, Gulshan -1, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Thai Emerald can be yet another restaurant that can be considered fine-dining. Their coconut ice cream alone is reason enough to visit, but if you want fine-dining with a family-dining experience, than Thai Emerald is the place to go to. The service is stellar and the food leaves you wanting more. Thai Emerald is located at House 24, Road 2, Gulshan 1, Dhaka 1212. Contrary to popular belief, fine dining isn't restricted to international or exotic food. Fine-dining can be had and done anywhere. Khazana is a prime example of fine-dining using just Indian food. Numerous 5-star hotels also come with numerous restaurants that also fit the ideals of fine-dining, such as the restaurants at Westin, Le Meridien and much more. Izumi offers yet another option and it is perhaps one of the best fine-dining experiences, provided you make it past the security. Of course, apart from these restaurants, you can also have fine-dining at home. Set yourself up a nice table and follow the fine-dining rules. Start off with your table. Place a set of forks on the left side and the set of knives and spoons on the right side. The fork/spoon furthest away from your plate is the one you start off with. In-between mouthfuls, which should be of small portions, set your cutlery down on your plate and enjoy the tastes and sensations each dish invokes. Placing your knives and spoons with the tips crossing means you aren't done. Place them vertically at the center of your plate to signal to the server that your meal is done or you are ready for the next course. If you are having dessert or soup, remember there are distinctive spoons for each. A napkin should be ready. Do not tuck in your napkin in your shirt but rather spread it on your lap. Also, remember to dab using your napkin and never wipe. Fine-dining also means a seating plan. Each seat should have the diner's name on a name card to show the designated place for them to sit. Finally, the kind of conversation that fine-dining allows must also be restricted. Politics and religion are a general no-no. Now that we are thinking of involving your kids, another thing you mustn't do is bring up their grades or try to use it as a way to teach them lessons or criticise them. Keep the conversation as civil as possible. If your mother or father is the one to have cooked, although this applies to almost anyone, do not begin by salting your food. Salting your food is considered an insult in many places, so take a bit first and then decide if you really need the salt. Finally, create the perfect ambience. If you have a server, then get him a tuxedo. This only adds the \"fine\" to fine-dining. Finally, proceed to eat your meals like you usually do. The typical Bangladeshi meal, in a classical sense, actually follows a certain sequence, with rice being the central item throughout. The sequence begins with something bitter, which is followed by vegetables of sorts, from 'shakh bhaji' or 'shobji-bhaji' to 'niramish torkari'. Then we move on to small fish, after which we have bigger fish. Only after that, we eat meat. The last item is 'daal'. Then, we have desserts, which is usually sweetmeats. Bangladeshi meal, one may therefore argue, follows the concept of course-by-course breakdown in the sense that a particular sequence is maintained.  If you actually take the effort to set the appropriate mood and if possible, dress up a little, fine-dining at your home is very much possible. Dressing up isn't mandatory but wouldn't it all be so much better if all of you looked your best for this one special meal? It will make it all the more worth remembering. And there will of course be plenty of pictures to capture the whole thing forever. Once a month, this can actually be a bond-building exercise, more powerful than the stuffy, quiet-while-you-eat meal times we are all used to sharing. Fine-dining is a growing industry in Bangladesh. While we have strides to take, the concept itself should not be lost in the shuffle. Fast food is great but if healthy food is served in the right fashion, then it makes a much more rewarding experience. Thus, if you get the time, try fine-dining sometime. Start off at home if you wish and then take it from there!   Osama Rahman is the Sub-Editor of Star Lifestyle and can be contacted at osamarahman@gmail.com\n Photo: LS Archive"

From going on planes frequently to creating e-waste by disposing of old phones and TVs, the luxuries are endless. But across the country, in cities by the Pacific Ocean, people have different attitudes. There, you can't go to a grocery store having forgotten your reusable shopping bag without your fellow shoppers frantically trying to find you one. Where does this rare awareness and urgency come from?  Every day when these shoppers leave their homes, they're reminded of reality. Waste dots their ocean, bobbing in the waves. They see the effects of reckless actions firsthand and therefore have a greater drive to make a difference.  As a US-residing Bangladeshi, I expected the same aspect of human nature to stay true in Dhaka. When I arrived a few weeks ago, I was surprised that I wasn't immediately overwhelmed by a craze over global warming. According to the Scientific American, melting snow in the Himalayas is causing frequent flooding. Water edges further and further into our land everyday on coastal areas, wiping away farms, houses, etc. The World Health Organization claims that all the water is causing water-borne diseases like cholera to be even more common, and in a country that is burdened by overpopulation, this is even more dangerous. The Daily Star reported that The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change deemed \"that groundwater, crop soils and many rivers are likely to become increasingly saline as a result of climate change effects.\"  However, Bangladeshis have adapted, as usual. This country has repeatedly stunned the rest of the world by improving despite incessant obstacles. The way people have dealt with climate change is no different. According to The World Bank, farmers have thought of ways to make their ground fertile again after saline contamination. Flood shelters that accommodate cattle have been built to incentifise locals to utilise them in Cox's Bazar.  But when I asked my great-grandmother's cook Asiya if she knew anything about what was causing the need to adapt, she met me with a blank stare. Following a study done by The Guardian, neither Asiya nor the farmers brainstorming constructive ways to fend off the effects of climate change emit even one-seventieth of the carbon the average American emits. The injustice is in the fact that they didn't cause the problem, yet they're having to deal with it and they haven't even been made aware of why problems are arising.  National Geographic projects that by 2050, Bangladesh will be partially underwater. So how can we create a people who are taught the reason behind the flooding? A people that will propel a California-effect by showing the perpetrators of climate change the humanity in those who are suffering from it? We can read, write, speak and protest. We can join forces with those around us and push for education, push for the agenda, because we live in a country that will always strive to do more than save itself. "

The court, led by Gowainghat Upazila Nirbahi Officer Bishwajit Pal, has also seized extracted stone from the spot. The raid was made on Wednesday after a report headlined \"Scenic Jaflong under assault\" was published in The Daily Star on the day.  The UNO said the drive was conducted to prevent stone lifting from the river. Some environmental organisations, including Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers' Association, Save the Heritage and Environment, Bangladesh Poribesh Abdolon and Waterkeeper, have long been trying to save the beauty of tourist spots in Sylhet, creating awareness among the people by holding rallies, human chains and seminars. Abdul Hye Al-Hadi, chief executive of Save the Heritage and Environment, said some local influentials had been illegally extracting stone by excavators from the river bed for long, posing a threat to the environment and a tea estate nearby. Abdul Karim Kim, general secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon, Sylhet chapter, told this correspondent that sensing the drive, the sand lifting syndicate removed several excavators from the spot. Locals alleged that although such drives were conducted on many occasions earlier, the influential stone lifters returned with their excavators within a few days by \"managing\" a section of political leaders. Local officials of the Department of Environment and members of Gowainghat Police Station and Border Guard Bangladesh were with the mobile court. According to a gazette notification issued in 2015, around 15sqkm area, from the Jaflong-Dawki river flowing into Bangladesh at the border with India to the edge of Sari-Gowainghat river, is Ecologically Critical Area. Any kind of stone extraction or economic activity that could affect the area's environment was restricted. A 2012 High Court order that asked the government to issue the gazette also asked to stop the use of such excavators and other earthmoving equipment in the area."

      "text": "\"At that point, I didn't care about anything anymore. Even if I died,\" she said. \"I never thought I'd see them again.\" The sisters were finally reunited on Sunday, more than three years after being taken by the militants in an assault on Sinjar, the Yazidi heartland on August 3, 2014. Just last week, Iraq declared \"final victory\" over Islamic State, with parades through the streets of Baghdad in celebration after three years of bloody war. But the damage done by the militants is not easily remedied: they brutalised Iraqis, exposing fault lines in the country's already fragile social fabric and ripping families apart. For Rosa and her family, though overjoyed at reuniting, the last three years will not be easily erased. The militants shot, beheaded, burned alive or kidnapped more than 9,000 members of the minority religion, in what the United Nations has called a genocidal campaign against them. According to community leaders, more than 3,000 Yazidis remain unaccounted for. Among them are Rosa's parents, thought murdered by the militants who rolled their victims into mass graves scattered across the sides of Sinjar mountain, where thousands of Yazidis still live in tents. The girls' nine-year-old brother, Zinal, is also still missing. Captured and held with them in the nearby city of Tal Afar, he was later driven away to Mosul in a car full of young Yazidi boys. They haven't heard from him since. Reuters could not verify all of the details given by Rosa, Bushra and some of the five older brothers they now live with in a group of tents in the tiny village of Sharya in Iraq's Kurdistan region. But Amin Khalat, spokesperson for Kurdish government office which helps return missing Yazidis, said Rosa and Suhayla had been taken to Syria and Turkey respectively after being held in Tal Afar and that his office had helped reunite them with their family. He said Rosa was returned from Syria by fighters from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and Suhayla by the Iraqi government which was alerted to her existence by Turkish officials who found her at a refugee camp in Turkey. Her family then recognised her photograph. Rosa said she and her younger siblings were sold, by the Islamic State militants who attacked Sinjar, to a fighter and his family in Tal Afar, a city of predominantly ethnic Turkmen which produced some of the group's most senior commanders. She said she did all the household chores and cared for her siblings and other young Yazidi captives, who lived together in a tiny room. After a year together, Zinal was taken to Mosul, while Suhayla and Bushra were sold off to separate Islamic State families, close to one another, but not allowed to meet. After Bushra's captors took her to Rosa's house for a visit, she said she memorised the route so she could return. \"I would wait till everyone fell asleep in the afternoon, I'd pretend to fall asleep and then sneak out to see Rosa,\" said Bushra. \"They once caught me and threatened to sell me off if I didn't stop seeing my sister but I didn't care.\" Bushra said she was eventually sold again, but about a year ago, she and six older Yazidi girls ran away and reached Sinjar, where Kurdish fighters helped them find their families. Rosa was taken to Deir Ezzor, Syria and sold twice more. She said she was originally bought for $4 in Tal Afar and last sold in Syria for $60. \"Those dogs made quite a good profit out of me,\" she said with a wry smile. PKK fighters came across her in Idlib and brought her back to Iraq and her family, she said. Suhayla was taken by her Turkmen captors to a refugee camp in Turkey, where authorities discovered her situation and repatriated her. She was reunited with her sisters and other relatives on Sunday, a day after Rosa returned. Beaten, forced to convert and forget their native Kurdish, the girls even had their names changed. Rosa was known as Noor - hers was an infidel's name, her captors told her. Suhayla, captured when she was three, barely recognises her sisters and speaks in broken Turkman dialect and Arabic. \"She has to learn to remember us again,\" said Rosa. \"She got used to calling some strangers mum and grandpa while she was held captive.\" Her sisters say Suhayla has barely spoken since returning to her family, but wearing a pink sweater and plastic jewelry, she relaxed under a flood of kisses from her sisters. Bushra, nine when she was captured, is only at ease with her closest relatives. Because she returned to the family first, her brothers have asked her to help her sisters, but she warned them that it would not be easy. \"It's true we are strong, we've been through so much. But our hearts are weak - they're broken.\""

      "text": "The new farm technologies, introduced during the Green Revolution in the 60's, contributed a lot to boost production and feed the country's rising population. Within several years, farmers and agriculturists noticed that modern technologies -- irrigated water, chemical fertilisers, pesticides and improved crop varieties -- adversely affected soil fertility, biodiversity and human health. Use of excessive pesticide, hormones, preservatives and ripening agents in food in the last decade raised serious concerns over food safety. \"This has created a huge demand for organic food,\" said Dr Nazim Uddin, coordinator of Bangladesh Organic Agriculture Network and also a farm scientist at Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (Bari). Around 12,000 farmers produce organic food -- rice, oilseeds, honey, vegetables, meat, fish etc -- on some 7,000 hectares of land, which is only 0.19 percent of the country's total farmland. The number of organic farmers doubled in the last decade, Nazim Uddin told The Daily Star. Producers and agriculturists said supply of organic food still lag far behind the demand. \"Though the prices of organic food are higher than inorganic items, consumers often complain of not getting organic food,\" said Shaheen Khan, chief executive officer of Gemcon Food and Agricultural Products Ltd that runs supermarket chain Meena Bazar. Farida Akhter, director of Ubinig, said the demand for organic food went up tenfold since 2009, and they failed to meet the soaring demand. Ubinig opened its organic food shop, Shashya Prabartana, in the capital in 2009. Nazim Uddin said farmland soil is composed of 17 nutrients and five percent of organic materials. However, excessive use of chemical fertilisers causes depletion of these natural elements in soil.  Organic materials in Bangladesh's soil came down to around 1 percent from 5 percent, while chemicals used in land leach into nearby water bodies and underground, polluting the environment, he added. Use of pesticides and herbicides kills many soil microbes as well as insects and animals like dragonflies, frogs that eat up harmful pests and earthworms. The chemicals get into the food chain, causing serious damages to human health, the Bari scientist told this correspondent. A woman preparing vermicompost, a nutrient rich fertiliser and soil conditioner used in sustainable, Photo:\nAzibor Rahman,\nPalash Khan \n According to him, vermicompost, cow dung and rotten crop plants or leaves, used in organic farming, enrich soil.  Ubinig Director Farida said modern farming promotes monoculture, which extracts nutrients from soil, but organic farming contributes to multi-cropping. For example, if mustard oil, radish and maize are grown on a piece of land at the same time, their combined residues will make up good natural fertiliser for soil. If crops were grown without using chemical fertilisers and pesticides, birds and beneficial insects would be in the fields to eat up the harmful insects, making it a natural pest control mechanism, Farida added. These factors inspired many people to go for organic farming in Bangladesh, she said. Non-government organisation Proshika first began organic farming in the country in 1976 on its land in Koitta of Manikganj. Over the years, it trained some 2.5 lakh framers on organic farming, said Proshika General Manager Kayes Shamim Polash. After the devastating flood in 1988, Ubinig officials realised that the flood-hit farmers in Tangail were failing to restart farming as they had no seeds and capital to buy fertilisers and pesticides. \"Farmers were totally dependent on the seed, fertilisers and pesticides from multinational companies,\" said Farida. Ubinig then conducted a research and started training farmers on preserving local seeds and growing crops using organic farming methods. Since then, over 50 NGOs and some business outlets came forward to produce and promote organic food. Farida said although the NGOs trained up farmers, who then started using organic farming methods, they could not establish a market linkage. Subsequently, many initiatives could not be completed, she added. \"Many farmers produce organic food, but we can't collect their produce and help them market as we can't operate like other businesses,\" she said. Some educated youths have got involved in organic farming. One of them is Delowar Jahan, a journalism graduate from Chittagong University. He along with some of his friends opened an organic food shop, Prakritik Krishi, in the capital in 2014.

Photo:\nAzibor Rahman,\nPalash Khan \n \"Being a small venture, we too have been facing challenges in managing the supply chain. We are working hard to overcome the challenges,\" he said.  However, the case of Kazi and Kazi Tea is different. It began farming organic tea on a vast land in Panchagarh's Tetulia in 2000. Apart from the tea, certified by three certifying agencies of Europe, Japan and the US, the company also produces herbs, rice, oil seed, honey and vegetables. \"We are exporting organic tea to the United States, Germany and Japan. We are on the way to export tea to France,\" said Syed Shoaib Ahmed, chief executive officer of Kazi and Kazi Tea. According to him, his company's business grew by 114 percent over the last five years. \"It takes three years to turn the soil organic. We have dug canals along the farmland to prevent chemical ingredients leaching into the farm from nearby fields,\" Shoaib said. The company used neem and other herbs as natural pest controllers in the Tetulia farm, he added.  Shaheen of Gemcon Food said they mostly sell organic products grown in their farm. \"Many farmers come to us to market their organic products. If we are convinced, we get their samples tested by the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research before selling those,\" he told The Daily Star. Certification of organic products is very crucial. Many might claim their produces to be organic and cheat consumers if there is no certification body, Shaheen added. Nazim Uddin said the government last year approved Bangladesh Organic Agriculture Policy with a provision of forming a certification body. Kayes Shamim of Proshika said there had been very little government support for organic farming. \"Promoting use of organic fertilisers should be a priority of the government if it really wants to promote the eco-friendly farming,\" he observed.

      "text": "Instagram beauty hacks have taken the world by storm. Hundreds of self-proclaimed beauty aficionados flood our newsfeeds everyday and, expert or not, they seem to have a hack for everything. With so many tricks out there designed to make your life easier, not boarding the hype-train seems almost unlawful.  So, I took it upon myself to try out some of the most popular beauty hacks and see if they work. APPLYING VASELINE TO YOUR LASHES MAKES THEM THICKER AND LONGER.\nSince I've been using Vaseline for years to achieve fuller lashes, I can vouch that this trick works wonders. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that it not only leads to under eye acne but also causes milia, which are little cysts under the eye and along the lashline. Upon close inspection, I did find tiny white bumps along my lashline - and no, that's not normal. Yes, long, fluttering eyelashes are a dream but it's time you steered clear of this particular beauty hack. Instead, try the aloe vera gel, castor oil and Vitamin-E oil concoction that beauty blogger Farah Dhukai swears by. It's a tried-and-tested success. USING RED LIPSTICK TO COLOUR-CORRECT DARK UNDER EYES\nAccording to the internet, dotting red lipstick under your eye eliminates dark shadows. While I'm a fan of the colour-correcting trend, I hadn't tried red lipstick as a substitute. As I'd suspected, this beauty hack left me looking like a demonic clown. The red lipstick doesn't blend well, and leaves your face in a pink mess. Final verdict? Stick to orange/peach hues to counteract dark under eyes. If you have a darker skin tone, this might just work for you.  As for the rest of us, we'll pass on looking like Jigglypuff.   GARLIC SHRINKS PIMPLES OVERNIGHT \nNumerous beauty bloggers swear by garlic's acne-healing properties. So, I decided to put it to the test. First, take a clove of garlic and make some cuts in it to extract the juice. Rub the garlic on pimples you may have and voila! You're left with clear skin the next morning.  Or so they say.  While garlic doesn't heal acne overnight, following this routine diligently, over a couple of days, visibly reduces acne. Final verdict? This works - just not as \"instantly\" as they say.  So, if you're looking for a magical acne-healer that works overnight, get in line like the rest of us.   USING HAIRSPRAY TO SET YOUR MAKEUP\nIf you've been blessed with oily skin like yours truly, this beauty hack will come in handy often. Sure, hairspray keeps your hair intact but it's not designed to do the same for make-up. It'll keep your make-up in place for 1-2 hours tops. So if you're looking at hairspray as a permanent fix, you might need to reconsider. The fumes in hairsprays contain large molecules which could clog your pores and cause blemishes.  If you see yourself reaching for a hairspray often as a substitute for a makeup setting spray, it might be a good time to invest in the real thing.  RUBBING LEMON ON YOUR SKIN FADES SCARS\nRaw lemon, which is highly acidic, can actually darken scars upon immediate exposure to the sun. Hence, use lemon sparingly - mix it with honey or your usual face pack for better results. Most importantly, apply the face mask 7-8 hours before stepping out into the sun to avoid sunburns and hyper pigmentation.  You're welcome.

It's now a problem for all countries...,\" he told a programme of the 1 Para Commando Battalion of Bangladesh Army at Rajshahi Cantonment. In the present context, the president said the role of para-commandos is very important, and that is why, every member of the battalion must achieve efficiency and skill of international standard. He said the army is a symbol of the country's trust and pride while the members of the special force are a part of this. The journey of the special force was launched in 1992, said Hamid, adding that the members of the force had performed many important responsibilities in the last 25 years. He said the commandos of the special force are very smart, disciplined and courageous soldiers, and they have been working sincerely to protect the country's sovereignty. Recalling the successful operations of the battalion in combating militancy, the president said the commandos of the battalion conducted \"Operation Thunderbolt\" at the city's Holey Artisan Bakery on July 1, 2016, and recovered 13 hostages, including foreign nationals, which helped improve the country's image. He said the members of the army work to manage crisis during natural disasters, including flood and landslide in the country and now they are working sincerely to distribute aid and provide other assistance to Rohingya people. Noting that there is no alternative to training in military life, Hamid said he believes that the trend of training and development will continue in the future. He said there is also no alternative to practice of knowledge and research for going forward in a rapidly changing, competitive and ICT-based world. The president said he believes that para commando battalion through its multidimensional and realistic initiatives will play a significant role in strengthening the country's defence, disaster management, and international peacekeeping missions. President Hamid bestowed the National Flag (national standard) to the 1-Para Commando Battalion at the programme. Cabinet members, the chiefs of the three services and senior military officials were present."

      "text": "Ashik Miah, a 45-year-old farmer of Jaladhartupi village, was staring helplessly at his inundated paddy field as he sat beside Dekhar Haor at Dakshin Sunamganj upazila. \"I cultivated Boro on around one hectare of land taking loans from a local lender. But the flash flood washed away all my investment. How will I repay the loan and where will I stand with my family now?\" lamented Ashik. He was talking about his miseries when he threw a desperate glance at this correspondent and asked, \"Who is responsible for the loss?\" Like Ashik Miah, 70-year-old farmer Rashid Miah, Rahim Uddin, Abdul Khalik and many others of Sunamganj experienced the same fate. Most of them had borrowed money either from local lenders or from different non-government organisations. As they have lost their lone crop, their annual earning, the farmers can now see only a bleak future ahead. Some of them have tried in vain to harvest the underwater crops dipping into waist-deep water. Most of them eventually found that the water level was much deeper than what they had anticipated. Boro, the only crop of the haor areas in Sunamganj, has submerged due to untimely heavy rain followed by the flash flood that hit the areas on March 27, around 15 to 20 days before the harvest. Though the government has taken an initiative to implement several projects of re-sectioning submersible embankments and repairing the damaged ones through the Water Development Board (WDB), the contractors who got the work allegedly did not deliver. The farmers along with the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), local lawmakers and rights activists have blamed it on the WDB and the contractors, as the incomplete embankments could not save their Boro cultivation this year like the previous years. Locals said the disaster could be avoided or, at least, minimised by manifolds if the repair and construction of the embankments in the haor areas were completed in time. According to the WDB, two types of projects have been launched by the department to build and repair the embankments. This year, 76 projects have been taken up for re-sectioning of submersible embankments in different haors of Sunamganj, while another 238 projects were approved for as many Project Implementation Committees (PICs). Both types of projects were supposed to be completed by this February 28, but the WDB extended the date to March 31. More than 50 percent work of the PIC projects have been completed, while the projects under contractors were apparently in a mess as most of them did not even start the work and some others completed 30 to 50 percent. However, farmers, rights activists and locals claim neither the projects of contractors nor the PICs started their work in time and could barely complete 10 to 20 percent of the work. They also claim the high officials of the WDB's Sylhet and Sunamganj offices' corruption is another big reason behind this. According to DAE, 166,000 hectares of land was cultivated during this Boro season. Of the cultivated land, approximately 133,000 hectares of land submerged, causing huge loss to 250,000 farmers. However, the farmers in the haor areas claim they have lost the season's cultivation. Jahedul Haque, deputy director of DAE Sunamganj, told The Daily Star that the work of the embankments needed to be completed before March, but neglect by the WDB and the contractors caused the massive damage to the only Boro cultivation of the year. Mouazzam Hossain Ratan, lawmaker of Sunamganj-1 constituency, told The Daily Star that local contractors backed by political leaders were responsible for the farmers' miseries. The MP alleged that Khairul Huda Chapal, president of Sunamganj district unit Juba League, president of Sunamganj Chamber of Commerce and Industries and brother of Sunamganj Zilla Parishad Chairman Nurul Huda Mukut, Sajib Ranjan Das, vice-president of Sunamganj Chamber, and some other local contractors along with a section of WDB officials are mainly responsible for everything. He added they have barely completed 10 percent of their designated work. \"I myself am a son of a farmer. I know the farmers will suffer for next three years as they have lost their only crop because of the neglect by the contractors and the Water Development Board officials,\" the lawmaker said, adding, \"They do not work but always get the money from the projects.\" He also alleged that local contractors have created a syndicate in connivance with the contractors from outside and had the contracts taken by the outsiders by sharing the benefits. Contacted, Sajib Ranjan Das, contractor of nine projects of building embankments 89.09 kilometres in length, said he had completed around 50 percent of his work before the flash flood hit the haor areas. Denying the allegations, he said the WDB had delayed in handing over some project areas. Khairul Huda Chapal, contractor of three projects, said the PICs were mainly responsible for the loss and the project of re-sectioning of submersible embankment projects requires a long time. He added these projects mostly include new areas to build the embankments. Sanjay Roy Chowdhury, chairman of Jayashree Union Parishad under Dharmapasha upazila and president of a PIC, said the committee's work was not responsible for the flash flood as the river overflowed and the water went beyond the safety level of the embankments. Contacted, Abdul Hai, acting chief engineer of WDB, Sylhet, said the huge workload needed enough time for pre-procedure of the projects, but it had to be delayed for official reasons during evaluation and handing over the sites. He put the blame on natural calamities and said the embankments were supposed to be 6.5 metres in height, but this year the floodwater flowed over 8.1 metres. He admitted that some of the contractors and PICs could not start the work in time and most of them could not even complete the projects. Denying the allegation of corruption, he said the WDB is in no way related to any kind of graft and they barely gave 15 to 16 percent of the fund to some contractors and 50 to 55 percent to the PICs. He, however, said three committees have been formed by the ministry, board and the Anti-Corruption Commission to unearth corruption, if there is any."

      "text": "The burial ground of 49 freedom fighters at Dalura of Sunamganj, who embraced martyrdom in 1971, is one of unique distinction in the country. Both Hindus and the Muslims have been laid to rest here in side by side in the same burial ground. Forty-three bodies, including 42 martyred freedom fighters, have been buried and six others have been cremated at Dalura. The memorial and a sculpture in memory of the Liberation War have been built next to the burial ground. The memorial and burial ground is located adjacent to the border pillar at Bangladesh-India joint border haat in the east and Balat Bazar of Meghalaya on the other side of the border. Locals have been looking after the memorial and burial ground. The story of their supreme sacrifice has been recorded in regional history in a scattered manner but not yet included in the national history. The name of an Ansar commander at the time, Abul Kalam alias Madhu Miah is intricately linked with the burial ground as it was he who collected the bodies of the freedom fighters killed in different areas at different times and arranged for their burial on 1.60 acres of government land at his own village Dalura. He also arranged for treatment of the injured freedom fighters.  During the liberation war Madhu Miah used to bury the martyrs  with the help of six others. Munshi Taru Miah led the namaz-e-janaza for the martyrs. Nepu Thakur would  take care of the cremation of the Hindu freedom fighters.  Madhu Miah recorded the names of the martyrs and their details in a notebook. His notebook has now become a source of information about the martyrs of Dalura. Madhu Miah himself fought the Pakistani occupation forces during the Liberation War.  Madhu Miah died on March 15, 2004 and he was buried inside the martyrs' ground to honour his last wishes. Local folk researcher Sumon Kumar Das said the burial ground of the 49 freedom fighters at Dalura is of significant distinction as there is no other similar place in Bangladesh that holds the spirit of patriotism of the Liberation War in Sylhet region like that. In 1979, local Mukti Sangram Smriti Trust took an initiative to preserve the graves of the martyrs.  The area was enclosed with a wall. Sub-sector commander Lt. Col. AS Helal Uddin (retd), a veteran of the Liberation War, took the initiative to inscribe the names of all the martyrs on marble plaques. Local Khoka Miah, appointed by Mukti Sangram Smriti Trust, has been taking care of the graveyard since 2001. A local commander of the freedom fighters, Lutfor Rahman alias Joj Miah said, People escaped Dhaka after the crackdown and streamed to their village for safety. Dalura was their choice as it was at the border and communication was good.  They then crossed over to Meghalaya. Some of them also took shelter in the refugee camps in India. Others joined training camps for the freedom fighters in India and returned to fight the Pakistani forces.  He said, students from Sylhet MC College, Mymensingh Ananda Mohan College and other colleges including Bhairab College would  came through this route to cross over to India.  That is why Dalura was strategically very important to the Pakistani forces. They had set up a camp on the bank of the Surma River and tried to prevent people from going to India.  The freedom fighters used a diversion route to reach the village. Sources said, Dalura area was under Balat sub-sector of sector no 5 during the Liberation War.  Several lakh people took shelter at Moilam area in Indian state of Meghalaya.  Joy Bangla Bazar on this side was a freed area where Pakistani occupation forces could not come. Pakistani forces stayed at Shologhar in Sunamganj town on the south bank of the Surma river, a few kilometers from Joy Bangla Bazar.  The freedom fighters set up their camp on a hill in Balat. They fought head-on with the Pakistani forces in the adjoining areas. The 48 freedom fighters martyred in fighting there at different times have been buried at Dalura. Sunamganj district and upazila administration and Mukti Sangram Smriti Trust jointly lay floral wreaths at the memorial altar on December 15 morning every year. Liberation War researchers want the place to be included in national history."

      "text": "Going against everything we have heard from experts about the importance of preserving and reclaiming Dhaka's wetlands, realtors at a meeting with Rajuk on Wednesday seem to have found a new solution. According to them, Dhaka has no need for its wetlands--one individual went so far as to say that these water bodies only serve to increase the mosquito population. It cannot be lost to anyone that reclamation of these water bodies which would go a long way in solving waterlogging would hurt the unethical business practices that realtors have followed over the years. Urban development experts have pointed out that eastern Dhaka was once defined by its aqua lands. Over the years, these areas which served as the city's natural drainage networks were turned into sand. Illegal encroachment of these bodies coupled with impunity are the reasons we are where we are today. This is despite the fact that the DAP and the Dhaka's master plan prohibit development of housing projects in such water bodies and flood flow zones. We have seen little action from the authorities to reclaim the 2,500 acres of flood flow zones and agricultural land from the grip of illegal property developers as the DAP suggests. Now, the realtors have demanded that Rajuk should not develop a new plan that \"it cannot implement.\" In effect, they are asking the authorities to forget about the water bodies that have been encroached and move on.  It is mainly due to opposition from realtors that Rajuk has failed to reclaim Dhaka's water bodies. Thankfully, the Rajuk chairman has responded by saying that Dhaka's officially recorded rivers, canals and water bodies would be conserved at any cost. We hope that the body acts on its laudable words. We have seen this year how greed-fuelled development disregarding environmental concerns can turn this city unliveable. It would be devastating to give it legitimacy as the realtors have demanded."

Keraniganj exemplified urbanism at its extreme, to say the least. Everywhere there were signs of both poverty and entrepreneurial energy. Nobody was sitting idle. Everybody was doing something. A ship was being built inches away from a three-story building. Life went on. In short, the neighbourhood seemed like a microcosm of Dhaka -- a city of chaos, poverty, development, and can-do aspirations. My most telling experience in Keraniganj, however, was a rudimentary vegetable \"shop\" on the side of a narrow alley, run by two minor siblings, Lubna and Selim. A piece of cloth was laid out on the street to display a small quantity of bitter melons. The sister-brother management sat against the wall, their faces full of innocent expectations that a pedestrian would soon stop and purchase their produce. By their side were a scale and weights, arranged in a pyramidal form. A recycled Nestle Lactogen Infant Formula dibba was used as a cash register. An existence of urban minimalism, the shop was a paradoxical sight of both endearment and heartbreak. A few questions should agitate us, if we can suspend our bourgeois denial that this is what tokais (Bangladeshi artist Ronobi's archetypal street urchin) do. Why were these kids not in school? Why do they have to work at such a tender age? Were they helping their impoverished parents? What are we doing as a society to prohibit children's suffering? What are the social and urban costs of a society failing its children? As much as it was heartbreaking to see kids robbed of their normal childhood, this sister-brother working team raises a broader question about urban poverty. Like other metropolises of developing economies, poverty is a ubiquitous phenomenon across cities in Bangladesh. Urban poverty is different from its rural counterpart. As Hossain Zillur Rahman has discussed, the key challenge of the urban poor is housing, while the rural poor are mainly disadvantaged by a lack of job opportunities. Urban planners need to see the disenfranchised classes not as the poor but as fellow human beings who deserve, like anybody else, basic access to all urban amenities and social institutions.  It is unhelpful that in Bangladesh urban poverty is still largely understood through the lens of slum studies. Yes, the urban poor live mainly in slums (according to a 2008 World Bank study 30 percent of Dhaka's metropolitan population are slum dwellers; however, not all urban poor live in slums). But to frame urban poverty in terms of the inadequacy of urban amenities (such as toilets and piped water supplies) in slums alone is to ignore a deeper social question, perpetuating the disenfranchisement of the urban poor. This is the question. What is society's attitude towards the \"poor\"? It is important to revisit this age-old question to disrupt the cycle of urban poverty in a sustainable way. Last year, I attended an urban poverty conference in Dhaka, jointly organised by the Power and Participation Research Centre and Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. High-ranking World Bank and UNDP officials, NGO leaders, activists, mayors, academics, and think-tank policy analysts attended the conference. Experts presented a series of talks, supported by an impressive body of data. I learned a lot at the meeting, particularly from many self-motivated social activists, who have been spearheading grassroots poverty alleviation programmes through human capacity building, despite their meagre financial means. In my own presentation during the concluding session, I sought to make a case for an attitudinal change in policies toward poverty reduction. I acknowledged that data is important for meaningful supports for the poor. But any empirical study of the poor must be coupled with a fundamental ethical position that the poor is not the Other. The poor shouldn't be abstracted as a social category -- a binary opposite of the bourgeois self -- to be quarantined for research and experimentation. While empirical research is essential, without human compassion it bureaucratises the concept of poverty and dehumanises the poor. The gaze of the researcher or the well-meaning donor often begins with the \"otherification\" of the poor. Postcolonial criticisms of the western academic going to Africa to study a tribal community and finding it \"primitive\" or \"savage\" is too crude an example to invoke here. It is not that empirical knowledge of the poor is unnecessary. But without compassion as public policy, big data keeps on calcifying the poor as a category, one that is isolated from any decision-making power structures. Without any real agency, this category is on perpetual life support. In his work on gender justice, Amartya Sen argued that real societal progress is made when women's empowerment takes a strong hold on the public's ethical imagination. A similar argument could be made in the case of poverty studies. An ethically based view of the poor as fellow citizens, rather than as an objectified research category, is urgently needed for any sustained alleviation of poverty. It is time policymakers, municipal administrators, and urban planners rethought urban poverty as a problem of social justice, not just as a problem of economic development. The issue of urban poverty should be examined with a bit of moral quandary and introspection into how the class-conscious bourgeoisie defines itself as the opposite of the poor. This very definition constitutes the central problem of urban poverty. The urban poor, who grease the wheel of the city's so-called informal economy, should not be kept socially invisible behind research, big data, and class wall. The poor must be seen with a human face, not as an abstraction. Let me provide one example. When a poor construction worker falls to his death at a building site, the middle-class feels sorry but never demands to learn the name of the victim in the news. He is a faceless, anonymous labourer, almost nonhuman. But when a \"middle-class\" member of society dies in a road accident in the city, he or she is a flesh-and-bones human being, with a grieving family. The victim is one of \"us,\" therefore there is much moral outrage. In short, the poor's social invisibility is very much embedded in how we define poverty as an unrelatable experience of the Other. And, big data tends to preserve the invisibility of the poor. Lest we forget, the idea of poverty has not been static in history. Both the idea and strategies for its relief have changed since the Industrial Revolution and industrial cities grew manifold in the modern era. Consider London, for instance. In the wake of the city's intense urbanisation in the 19th century, a highly divisive political and philosophical debate raged about reforming laws related to poor people. Should the poor be the charge of the state? It was hardly a straightforward argument between state responsibility and private charity. In fact, as studies show, in 19th-century London, private charity flourished when public relief for the poor was most generous. At the centre of this vexing debate was this question: would top-down \"help\" (from the state and wealthy private citizens) diminish the poor's ability to take personal responsibility? So intense a philosophical discussion was it that even Tocqueville and Hegel followed the English turmoil with much fascination. In Bangladesh, rural microcredit initiatives, particularly Grameen Bank's and BRAC's, began in the 1970s, in many ways, to address the English question with the panacea of self-help. That is, the poor is not passive. They can figure out a way of transcending poverty if they receive some credit (without collateral). Retaining the basic premises of market economy, microcredit essentially sought to empower the poor with the ethos of entrepreneurship from below. The dichotomy of state- and donor-driven strategies of poverty alleviation and empathetic, bottom-up, and activist NGO efforts in capacity building among the poor continues to animate the urban poverty debate in Bangladesh and elsewhere. My own concerns have been what urban planners could do about it. They can begin by acknowledging that urban poverty is, first and foremost, a crisis of social justice. Planners and city professionals must debunk the urban mythology that the poor is a closed social group in need of an improved ghetto. It is important not to forget that the poor are typically stuck in spatial traps, often legitimised through official planning processes. These spatial traps are slums, unsanitary industrial zones, flood-prone river banks, and footpaths. By keeping the poor on the urban fringe and hazardous areas, cities often deny them social justice and access to networks of economic mobility. By ghettoising the poor in undesirable, environmentally precarious areas, both cities and capitalistic systems seek to fortify a false sense of social hygiene. Urban planners need to see the disenfranchised classes not as the poor but as fellow human beings who deserve, like anybody else, basic access to all urban amenities and social institutions. Slum improvement is a tragic oxymoron, not social justice. An inclusive and liveable city treats all its citizens with fairness and humanity. Only when we agree with the moral premise of this hypothesis can we feel rightly outraged to see children like Lubna and Selim oddly playing adult roles as vegetable sellers on the streets of Keraniganj. Until these children, any children, have the normal life they deserve, we only have a city of moral poverty.

      "text": "Bangladesh is now trying to buy rice from Thailand and India under the government-to-government arrangement, weeks after striking a G2G deal to import the staple from Vietnam. The government is also opening two more international bids this week, seeking to import 50,000 tonnes of rice and equal amount of wheat. This would be the first public sector wheat import in the last eight months. The moves come amid high rice prices in the domestic market and further depletion of the public food reserve. The government had already a low food reserve -- below five lakh tonnes -- in June. Now, the volume has come down to 3.4 lakh tonnes, of which rice stock is only 1.54 lakh tonnes. Apart from the regular food aid programmes, rice and wheat stored in the public granaries are also being given to flood and landslide victims as assistance. Meanwhile, the price of per kg of coarse rice has dropped by Tk 2 from Tk 48 last week. Rice prices had posted a 47 percent increase comparing the prices in June last year. Market sources said the prices would go down further as private traders were bringing in the staple from India after the import duty was lowered to 10 percent from 28 percent. The government is also expecting the first consignment of rice from Vietnam to reach the Chittagong port by the end of this week. Following this year's crop loss owing to Haor flashfloods and fungal attacks (rice blast), the government struck three deals in May and June for importing 3.5 lakh tonnes of rice -- 1 lakh tonnes from two Dubai and Singapore-based suppliers and 2.5 lakh more from Vietnam under the G2G. None of the import consignments, however, has reached the country yet. The government is now seeking to import more rice from Thailand and India to ensure the staple's availability in the market as the flood situation is worsening and the prospect of the upcoming rice season seems uncertain. A two-member official team comprising one official each from the food ministry and food directorate left for Bangkok on Wednesday to look into the possibility of purchasing rice from Thailand under the G2G arrangement. \"We're also expecting a team from India to visit Bangladesh soon. We'll try to buy rice from India as well,\" Food Minister Qamrul Islam told The Daily Star yesterday. He, however, insisted that he would not say at this stage how much rice the government was intending to buy from the two countries. In addition to floating international tenders seeking to buy 1.5 lakh tonnes of parboiled (Shiddo) and white (Atap) rice, the food department would also open bids for importing 50,000 tonnes of more parboiled rice this week. Tender is also being floated to buy 50,000 tonnes of wheat from the international market to replenish the depleting food reserve. This was the first public sector wheat tender since October last year. In 2016-17, Bangladesh imported over 58 lakh tonnes of wheat. Over 80 percent of that wheat was brought in by private importers. Early flashfloods this season completely washed away 10 lakh tonnes of rice in the northeastern areas while fungal attack blast also caused losses of Boro crops in 19 districts, said the agricultural extension department.    A prolonged flood in the northeast and northwestern regions is also being feared to have some bearings on the productions of this year's two remaining rice crops -- Aus and Aman."

Seven acres of his cultivated boro land were damaged by flash flood triggered by heavy rain and water from hills across the border, said Abdul Mannan Khan of Harinakandi village in Tahirpur upazila. He blamed local Water Development Board authorities for the damage as they did not take any initiative to protect the embankments from the floodwater despite repeated pleas."

      "text": "On June 13, 1971, The Sunday Times of London ran a 16 column (2-page) story, titled GENOCIDE, on the atrocities that were being carried out in Bangladesh, then East Pakistan. The world was stunned by this revelatory piece by a Pakistani journalist -- Anthony Mascarenhas -- invited by its military to see the operations conducted by them. Overcome by revulsion of what he saw, he published the following report after moving first his family, and then himself, to UK. The writer was Assistant Editor, Morning News, Karachi. Given the ongoing War Crimes trial and the death penalty meted out to one of the perpetrators,and to mark the Martyred Intellectuals Day, we reprint The Sunday Times report to remind our readers how this report completely shattered the Pakistani propoganda effort and helped to turn world public opinion in favour of our Liberation War.   Like thousands of other people in East Bengal, he had made the mistake, the fatal mistake of running within sight of a Pakistani army patrol. He was 24 years old, a slight man surrounded by soldiers. He was trembling, because he was about to be shot. \"Normally we would have killed him as he ran,\" I was informed chattily by Major Rathore, the G-2 Ops. of the 9th Division, as we stood on the outskirts of a tiny village near Mudafarganj, about 20 miles south of Comilla. \"But we are checking him out for your sake. You are new here and I see you have a squeamish stomach.\" \"Why kill him?\" I asked with mounting concern. \"Because he might be a Hindu or he might be a rebel, perhaps a student or an Awami Leaguer. They know we are sorting them out and they betray themselves by running.\" \"But why are you killing them? And why pick on the Hindus?\" I persisted. \"Must I remind you,\" Rathore said severely, \"how they have tried to destroy Pakistan? Now under the cover of the fighting we have an excellent opportunity of finishing them off.\"   \"Of course,\" he added hastily, \"we are only killing the Hindu men. We are soldiers, not cowards like the rebels. They kill our women and children.\" I was getting my first glimpse of the stain of blood which has spread over the otherwise verdant land of East Bengal. First it was the massacre of the non-Bengalis in a savage outburst of Bengali hatred. Now it was massacre, deliberately carried out by the West Pakistan army. The pogrom's victims are not only the Hindus of East Bengal -- who constitute about 10% of the 75 million population -- but also many thousands of Bengali Muslims. These include university and college students, teachers, Awami League and Left-Wing political cadres and every one the army can catch of the 176,000 Bengali military men and police who mutinied on March 26 in a spectacular, though untimely and ill-starred bid, to create an independent Republic of Bangla Desh. What I saw and heard with unbelieving eyes and ears during my 10 days in East Bengal in late April made it terribly clear that the killings are not the isolated acts of military commanders in the field. The West Pakistani soldiers are not the only ones who have been killing in East Bengal, of course. On the night of March 25 -- and this I was allowed to report by the Pakistani censor -- the Bengali troops and paramilitary units stationed in East Pakistan mutinied and attacked non-Bengalis with atrocious savagery. Thousands of families of unfortunate Muslims, many of them refugees from Bihar who chose Pakistan at the time of the partition riots in 1947, were mercilessly wiped out. Women were raped, or had their breasts torn out with specially fashioned knives. Children did not escape the horror: the lucky ones were killed with their parents; but many thousands of others must go through what life remains for them with eyes gouged out and limbs roughly amputated. More than 20,000 bodies of non-Bengalis have been found in the main towns, such as Chittagong, Khulna and Jessore. The real toll, I was told everywhere in East Bengal, may have been as high as 100,000; for thousands of non-Bengalis have vanished without a trace. The government of Pakistan has let the world know about that first horror. What it has suppressed is the second and worse horror which followed when its own army took over the killing. West Pakistani officials privately calculate that altogether both sides have killed 250,000 people -- not counting those who have died of famine and disease. Reacting to the almost successful breakaway of the province, which has more than half the country's population, General Yahya Khan's military government is pushing through its own \"final solution\" of the East Bengal problem. \"We are determined to cleanse East Pakistan once and for all of the threat of secession, even if it means killing of two million people and ruling the province as a colony for 30 years,\" I was repeatedly told by senior military and civil officers in Dacca and Comilla. The West Pakistan army in East Bengal is doing exactly that with a terrifying thoroughness. We had been racing against the setting sun after a visit to Chandpur (the West Pakistan army prudently stays indoors at night in East Bengal) when one of the jawans (privates) crouched in the back of the Toyota Land Cruiser called out sharply: \"There's a man running, Sahib.\" Major Rathore brought the vehicle to an abrupt halt, simultaneously reaching for the Chinese made light machine-gun propped against the door. Less than 200 yards away a man could be seen loping through the knee-high paddy. \"For God's sake don't shoot,\" I cried. \"He's unarmed. He's only a villager.\" Rathore gave me a dirty look and fired a warning burst. As the man sank to a crouch in the lush carpet of green, two jawans were already on their way to drag him in. The thud of a rifle butt across the shoulders preceded the questioning. \"Who are you?\" \"Mercy, Sahib! My name is Abdul Bari. I'm a tailor from the New Market in Dacca.\" \"Don't lie to me. You're a Hindu. Why were you running?\" \"It's almost curfew time, Sahib, and I was going to my village.\" \"Tell me the truth. Why were you running?\" Before the man could answer he was quickly frisked for weapons by a jawan while another quickly snatched away his lungi. The skinny body that was bared revealed the distinctive traces of circumcision, which is obligatory for Muslims. At least it could be plainly seen that Bari was not a Hindu. The interrogation proceeded. \"Tell me, why were you running?\" By this time Bari, wild eyed and trembling violently, could not answer. He buckled at the knees. \"He looks like a fauji, sir,\" volunteered one jawan as Bari was hauled to his feet, (Fauji is the Urdu word for soldier: the army uses it for the Bengali rebels it is hounding.) \"Could be,\" I heard Rathore mutter grimly. Abdul Bari was clouted several times with the butt end of a rifle, then ominously pushed against a wall. Mercifully his screams brought a young head peeping from the shadows of a nearby hut. Bari shouted something in Bengali. The head vanished. Moments later a bearded old man came haltingly from the hut. Rathore pounced on him. \"Do you know this man?\" \"Yes, Sahib. He is Abdul Bari.\" \"Is he a fauji?\" \"No Sahib, he is a tailor from Dacca.\" \"Tell me the truth.\" \"Khuda Kassam (God's oath), Sahib, he is a tailor.\" There was a sudden silence. Rathore looked abashed as I told him: \"For God's sake let him go. What more proof do you want of his innocence?\" But the jawans were apparently unconvinced and kept milling around Bari. It was only after I had once more interceded on his behalf that Rathore ordered Bari to be released. By that time he was a crumpled, speechless heap of terror. But his life had been saved. For six days as I travelled with the officers of the 9th Division headquarters at Comilla I witnessed at close quarters the extent of the killing. I saw Hindus, hunted from village to village and door to door, shot off-hand after a cursory \"short-arm inspection\" showed they were uncircumcised. I have heard the screams of men bludgeoned to death in the compound of the Circuit House (civil administrative headquarters) in Comilla. I have seen truck loads of other human targets and those who had the humanity to try to help them hauled off under the cover of darkness and curfew. I have witnessed the brutality of \"kill and burn missions\" as the army units, after clearing out the rebels, pursued the pogrom in the towns and the villages. I have seen whole villages devastated by \"punitive action.\" And in the officers' mess at night I have listened incredulously as otherwise brave and honourable men proudly chewed over the day's kill. \"How many did you get?\" The answers are seared in my memory. All this is being done, as any West Pakistani officer will tell you, for the \"preservation of the unity, the integrity and the ideology of Pakistan.\" It is, of course, too late for that. The very military action that is designed to hold together the two wings of the country, separated by a thousand miles of India, has confirmed the ideological and emotional break. East Bengal can only be kept in Pakistan by the heavy hand of the army. And the army is dominated by the Punjabis, who traditionally despise and dislike the Bengalis. The break is so complete today that few Bengalis will willingly be seen in the company of a West Pakistani. I had a distressing experience of this kind during my visit to Dacca when I went to visit an old friend. \"I'm sorry,\" he told me as he turned away, \"things have changed. The Pakistan that you and I knew has ceased to exist. Let us put it behind us.\" Hours later a Punjabi army officer, talking about the massacre of the non! Bengalis before the army moved in, told me: \"They have treated us more brutally than the Sikhs did in the partition riots in 1947. How can we ever forgive or forget this?\" The bone-crushing military operation has two distinctive features. One is what the authorities like to call the \"cleansing process;\" a euphemism for massacre. The other is the \"rehabilitation effort.\" This is a way of describing the moves to turn East Bengal into a docile colony of West Pakistan. These commonly used expressions and the repeated official references to \"miscreants\" and \"infiltrators\" are part of the charade which is being enacted for the benefit of the world. Strip away the propaganda, and the reality is colonisation -- and killing. The justification for the annihilation of the Hindus was paraphrased by Lt. Gen. Tikka Khan, the Military Governor of East Pakistan, in a radio broadcast I heard on April 18. He said: \"The Muslims of East Pakistan, who had played a leading part in the creation of Pakistan, are determined to keep it alive. However, the voice of the vast majority had been suppressed through coercion, threats to life and property by a vocal, violent and aggressive minority, which forced the Awami League to adopt the destructive course.\" Others, speaking privately, were more blunt in seeking justification. \"The Hindus had completely undermined the Muslim masses with their money,\" Col. Naim, of 9th Division headquarters, told me in the officers' mess at Comilla. They bled the province white. Money, food and produce flowed across the borders to India. In some cases they made up more than half the teaching staff in the colleges and schools, and sent their own children to be educated in Calcutta. It had reached the point where Bengali culture was in fact Hindu culture, and East Pakistan was virtually under the control of the Marwari businessmen in Calcutta. We have to sort them out to restore the land to the people, and the people to their Faith.\" Or take Major Bashir. He came up from the ranks. He is SSO of the 9th Division at Comilla and he boasts of a personal body count of 28. He had his own reasons for what has happened. \"This is a war between the pure and the impure,\" he informed me over a cup of green tea. \"The people here may have Muslim names and call themselves Muslims. But they are Hindus at heart. You won't believe that the maulvi (mulla) of the Cantonment mosque here issued a fathwa (edict) during Friday prayers that the people would attain janat (paradise) if they killed West Pakistanis. We sorted the bastard out and we are now sorting out the others. Those who are left will be real Muslims. We will even teach them Urdu.\" Everywhere I found officers and men fashioning imaginative garments of justification from the fabric of their own prejudices. Scapegoats had to be found to legitimise, even for their own consciences, the dreadful \"solution\" to what in essence was a political problem: the Bengalis won the election and wanted to rule. The Punjabis, whose ambitions and interests have dominated government policies since the founding of Pakistan in 1947, would brook no erosion of their power. The army backed them up. Officials privately justify what has been done as retaliation for the massacre of the non-Bengalis before the army moved in. But events suggest that the pogrom was not the result of a spontaneous or undisciplined reaction. It was planned.   It seems clear that the \"sorting-out\" began to be planned about the time that Lt-Gen. Tikka Khan took over the governorship of East Bengal, from the gentle, self-effacing Admiral Ahsan, and the military command there, from the scholarly Lt-Gen. Sahibzada Khan. That was at the beginning of March, when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's civil disobedience movement was gathering momentum after the postponement of the assembly meeting from which the Bengalis hoped for so much. President Yahya Khan, it is said, acquiesced in the tide of resentment caused in the top echelons of the military establishment by the increasing humiliation of the West Pakistani troops stationed in East Bengal. The Punjabi Eastern Command at Dacca continues to dominate the policies of the Central Government. [It is perhaps worth pointing out that the Khans are not related: Khan is a common surname in Pakistan.] When the army units fanned out in Dacca on the evening of March 25, in pre-emptive strikes against the mutiny planned for the small hours of the next morning, many of them carried lists of people to be liquidated. These included the Hindus and large numbers of Muslims; students, Awami Leaguers, professors, journalists and those who had been prominent in Sheikh Mujib's movement. The charge, now publicly made, that the army was subjected to mortar attack from the Jaganath Hall, where the Hindu university students lived, hardly justifies the obliteration of two Hindu colonies, built around the temples on Ramna race course, and a third in Shakrepati, in the heart of the old city. Nor does it explain why the sizeable Hindu populations of Dacca and the neighbouring industrial town of Narayanganj should have vanished so completely during the round-the-clock curfew on March 26 and 27. There is similarly no trace of scores of Muslims who were rounded up during the curfew hours. These people were eliminated in a planned operation: an improvised response to Hindu aggression would have had different results. Touring Dacca on April 15 1 found the heads of four students lying rotting on the roof of the Iqbal Hall hostel. The caretaker said they had been killed on the night of March 25. I also found heavy traces of blood on the two staircases and in four of the rooms. Behind Iqbal Hall a large residential building seemed to have been singled out for special attention by the army. The walls were pitted with bullet holes and a foul smell still lingered on the staircase, although it had been heavily powdered with DDT. Neighbours said the bodies of 23 women and children had been carted away only hours before. They had been decomposing on the roof since March 25. It was only after much question!ing that I was able to ascertain that the victims belonged to the nearby Hindu shanties. They had sought shelter in the building as the army closed in. THIS IS GENOCIDE conducted with amazing casualness. Sitting in the office of Major Agha, Martial Law Administrator of Comilla city, on the morning of' April 19, I saw the off-hand manner in which sentences were meted out. A Bihari sub-inspector of police had walked in with a list of prisoners being held' in the police lock-up. Agha looked it over. Then, with a flick of his pencil, he casually ticked off four names on the list. \"Bring these four to me this evening for disposal,\" he said. He looked at the list again. The pencil flicked once more. \"... and bring this thief along with, them.\" The death sentence had been pronounced over a glass of coconut milk. I was informed that two of the prisoners were Hindus, the third a \"student,\" and the fourth an Awami League organiser. The \"thief,\" it transpired, was a lad named Sebastian who had been caught moving the household effects of a Hindu friend to his own house. Later that evening I saw these men, their hands and legs tied loosely with, a single rope, being led down the road to the Circuit House compound. A little after curfew, which was at 6 o'clock, a flock of squawking mynah birds were disturbed in their play by the thwacking sound of wooden clubs meeting bone and flesh. Captain Azmat of the Baluch Regiment had two claims to fame according to the mess banter. One was his job as ADC to Maj.-Gen. Shaukat Raza. Commanding officer of the 9th Division. The other was thrust on him by his colleagues' ragging. Azmat, it transpired, was the only officer in the group who had not made a\" kill\" Major Bashir needled him mercilessly. \"Come on Azmat \" Bashir told him one night, \"we are going to make a man of you. Tomorrow we will see how you can make them run. It's so easy.\" To underscore the point Bashir went into one of his long spiels. Apart from his duties as SSO, Bashir was also \"education officer\" 'at Headquarters. He was the only Punjabi officer I found who could speak Bengali fluently. By general agreement Bashir was also a self-taught bore who gloried in the sound of his own voice. A dari walla (bearded man) we were told, had come to see Bashir that morning to inquire about his brother, a prominent Awami League organiser of Comilla who had been netted by the army some days earlier. Dhor gaya, Bashir said he told him:\" He has run away. The old man could'nt comprehend how his brother could have escaped on a broken leg. Neither could 1. So Major Bashir, with a broad wink, enlightened me. The record would show dhor gaya: \"shot while escaping.\" I never did find out whether Captain Azmat got his kill. The rebel Bengali forces who had dug in at Feni, seventy miles north of Chittagong on the highway to Comilla, had tied down the 9th Division by destroying all the bridges and culverts in the area. General Raza was getting hell from the Eastern Command at Dacca which was anxious to have the south-eastern border sealed against escaping rebels. It was also desperately urgent to open this only land route to the north to much-needed supplies that had been piling up in the port at Chittagong. So General Raza was understandably waspish. He flew over the area almost daily. He also spent hours haranguing the brigade that, was bogged down at Feni. Captain Azmat, as usual, was the General's shadow. I did not see him again. But if experience is any pointer, Azmat probably had to sweat out his \"kill\" and the ragging-for another three weeks. It was only on May 8 that the 9th Division was able to clear Feni and the surrounding area. By then the Bengali rebels, forced out by relentless bombing and artillery barrages, had escaped with their weapons across the neighbouring border into India. The escape of such large numbers of armed, hard-core regulars among the Bengali rebels was a matter of grave concern to Lt.-Col. Aslam Baig, G-1 at 9th Division headquarters. \"The Indians,\" he explained, will \"obviously not allow them to settle there. It would be too dangerous. So they will be allowed in on sufferance as long as they keep making sorties across the border. Unless we can kill them off, we are going, to have serious trouble for a long time.\" Lt: Col. Baig was a popular artillery officer who had done a stint in China after the India-Pakistan war when units of the Pakistan Army were converting to Chinese equipment. He was said to be a pround family man. He also loved Cowers. He told me with unconcealed pride that during a previous posting at Comilla he had brought from China the giant scarlet waterlillies that adorn the pond opposite the headquarters. Major Bashir adored him. Extolling one officer's decisiveness Bashir told me that once they had caught a rebel officer there was a big fuss about what should be done with him. \"While the others were telephoning all over for instructions,\" he said, \"he solved the problem. Dhor gaya. Only the man's foot was left sticking out of the ditch.\" It is hard to imagine so much brutality in the midst of so much beauty. Comilla was blooming when I went there towards the end of April. The rich green ,carpet of rice paddies spreading to the horizon on both sides of the road was broken here and there by bright splashes of red. That was the Gol Mohor, aptly dubbed the\" Flame, of the Forest,\" coming to full bloom. Mango and coconut trees in the villages dotting the countryside were heavy with fruit. Even the terrier-sized goats skipping across the road gave evidence of the abundance of nature in Bengal. \"The only, way you can tell the male from the female,\" they told me,\" is that all the she-goats are pregnant.\"   In one of the most crowded areas of the entire world, Comilla district has a population density of 1,900 to the square mile-only man was nowhere to be seen. \"Where are the Bengalis ?\" I had asked my escorts in the strangely empty streets of Dacca a few days earlier.\" They have gone to the villages, - was the stock reply. Now, in the countryside, there were still no Bengalis. Comilla town like Dacca was heavily shuttered. And in ten miles on the road to Laksham. past silent villages, the peasants I saw could have been counted on the fingers of both hands. There were, of course, soldiers-hundreds of unsmiling men in khaki, each with an automatic rifle. According to orders, the rifles never left their hands. The roads are constantly patrolled by tough, trigger-happy men. Wherever the army is, you won't find Bengalis. Martial law orders, constantly repeated on the radio and in the Press, proclaim the death penalty for any one caught in the act of sabotage. If a road is obstructed or a bridge damaged or destroyed, all houses within 10 yards of the spot are liable to be demolished and their inhabitants rounded up. The practice is even more terrible than anything the words could suggest. \"Punitive action\" is something that the Bengalis have come to dread. We saw what this meant when we were approaching Hajiganj, which straddles the road to Chandpur, on the morning of April 17. A few miles before Hajiganj, a 15-foot bridge had been damaged the previous night by rebels who were still active in the area. According to Major Rathore (G-2 Ops.), an army unit had immediately been sent out to take punitive action. Long spirals of smoke could be seen on all sides up to a distance of a quarter of a mile from the damaged bridge. And as we carefully drove over a bed of wooden boards, with which it had been hastily repaired, we could see houses in the village on the right beginning to catch fire. At the back of the village some jawans were spreading the flames with dried coconut fronds. They make excellent kindling and are normally used for cooking. We could also see a body sprawled between the coconut trees at the entrance to the village. On other side of the road another village in the rice paddies showed evidence of the fire that had gutted more than a dozen bamboo and mat huts. Hundreds of villagers had escaped before the army came. Others, like the man among the coconut trees, were slow to get away. As we drove on, Major Rathore said, \"They brought it on themselves.\" I said it was surely too terrible a vengeance on innocent people for the acts of a handful of rebels. He did not answer. A few hours later when we were again passing through Hajiganj on the way back from Chandpur, I had my first exposure to the savagery of a \"kill and burn mission\". We were still caught up in the aftermath of a tropical storm which had hit the area that afternoon. A heavy overcast made ghostly shadows on the mosque towering above the town. Light drizzle was beginning to wet the uniforms of Captain Azhar and the four jawans riding in the exposed escort jeep behind us. We turned a corner and found a convoy of trucks parked outside the mosque. I counted seven, all filled with jawans in battle dress. At the head of the column was& a jeep. Across the road two men, supervised by a third, were trying to batter down the door of one of more than a hundred shuttered shops lining the road. The studded teak wood door was beginning to give under the combined assault of two axes as Major Rathore brought the Toyota to a halt. \"What the hell are you doing ?\" The tallest of the trio, who was supervising the break-in, turned and peered at us. \"Mota,\" (Fatty) he shouted, \"what the hell do you think we are doing?\" Recognising the voice, Rathore drew a water-melon smile. It was, he informed me, his old friend \" Ifty\" Major Iftikhar of the 12th Frontier Force Rifles. Rathore : \"I thought someone was looting.\" Iftikhar :\"Looting ? No. We are on kill and burn.\" Waving his Land to take in the shops, he said he was going to destroy the ' Rathore: \"How many did you get?\" Iftikhar smiled bashfully. Rathore: \"Come on. How many did you get ?\" Iftikhar: \"Only twelve. And by God we were lucky to get them. We would have lost those, too, if I hadn't sent my men from the back.\" PRODDED by Major Rathore, Iftikhar then went on to describe vividly how after much searching in Hajiganj he had discovered twelve Hindus hiding in a house on the outskirts of the town. These had been \"disposed of.\" Now Major Iftikhar was on the second part of his mission: burn. By this time the shop's door had been demobilised and we found ourselves looking into one of those tiny catch-all establishments which, in these parts, go under the title \"Medical & Stores.\" Under the Bengali lettering the signboard carried in English the legend \"Ashok Medical & Stores.\" Lower down was painted \"Prop. A. M. Bose.\" Mr. Bose, like the rest of the people of Hajiganj, had locked and run away. In front of the shop a small display cabinet was crammed with patent medicines, cough syrups, some bottles of mango squash, imitation jewellery, reels of coloured cotton, thread and packets of knicker elastic. Iftikhar kicked it over, smashing the light wood-work into kindling. Next he reached out for some jute shopping bags on one shelf. He took some plastic toys from another. A bundle of handkerchiefs and a small bolt of red cloth joined the pile on the floor. Iftikhar heaped them all together and borrowed a matchbox from one of the jawans sitting in our Toyota. The jawan had ideas of his own. Jumping from the vehicle he ran to the shop and tried to pull down one of the umbrellas hanging from the low ceiling of the shop. Iftikhar ordered him out. Looting, he was sharply reminded, was against orders. Iftikhar soon had a fire going. He threw burning jute bags into one corner of the shop, the bolt of cloth into another. The shop began to blaze. Within minutes we could hear the crackle of flames behind shuttered doors as the fire spread to the shop on the left, then on to the next one. At this point Rathore was beginning to get anxious about the gathering darkness. So we drove on. When I chanced to meet Major Iftikhar the next day he ruefully told me: \"I burnt only sixty houses. If it hadn't rained I would have got the whole bloody lot.\" Approaching a village a few miles from Mudarfarganj we were forced to a halt by what appeared to be a man crouching against a mud wall. One of the jawans warned it might be a fauji sniper. But after careful scouting it turned out to be a lovely young Hindu girl. She sat there with the placidity of her people, waiting for God knows who. One of the jawans had been ten years with the East Pakistan Rifles and could speak bazaar Bengali. He was told to order her into the village. She mumbled something in reply, but stayed where she was, but was ordered a second time. She was still sitting there as we drove away. \"She has,\" I was informed, \"nowhere to go -- no family, no home.\" Major Iftikhar was one of several officers assigned to kill and burn missions. They moved in after the rebels had been cleared by the army with the freedom to comb-out and destroy Hindus and \"miscreants\" (the official jargon for rebels) and to burn down everything in the areas from which the army had been fired at. This lanky Punjabi officer liked to talk about his job. Riding with Iftikhar to the Circuit House in Comilla on another occasion he told me about his latest exploit. \"We got an old one,\" he said. \"The bastard had grown a beard and was posing as a devout Muslim even called himself Abdul Manan. But we gave him a medical inspection and the game was up.\" Iftikhar continued: \"I wanted to finish him there and then, but my men told me such a bastard deserved three shots. So I gave him one in the balls, then one in the stomach. Then I finished him off with a shot in the head.\" When I left Major Iftikhar he was headed north to Bramanbaria. His mission: Another kill and burn. Overwhelmed with terror the Bengalis have one of two reactions. Those who can run away just seem to vanish. Whole towns have been abandoned as the army approached. Those who can't run away adopt a cringing servility which only adds humiliation to their plight. Chandpur was an example of the first. In the past this key river port on the Meghna was noted for its thriving business houses and gay life. At night thousands of small country boats anchored on the river's edge made it a fairy land of lights. On April 18 Chandpur was deserted. No people, no boats. Barely one per cent of the population had remained. The rest, particularly the Hindus who constituted nearly half the population, had fled. Weirdly they had left behind thousands of Pakistani flags fluttering from every house, shop and rooftop. The effect was like a national day celebration without the crowds. It only served to emphasise the haunted look. The flags were by way of insurance. Somehow the word had got around that the army considered any structure without a Pakistani flag to be hostile and consequently to be destroyed. It did not matter how the Pakistani flags were made, so long as they were adorned with the crescent and star. So they came in all sizes, shapes and colours. Some flaunted blue fields, instead of the regulation green. Obviously they had been hastily put together with the same material that had been used for the Bangladesh flag. Indeed, blue Pakistani flags were more common than the green. The scene in Chandpur was repeated in Hajiganj, Madarfarganj, Kasba, Brahmanbaria; all ghost towns gay with flags.   Laksham was an example of the other reaction; cringing  When I drove into the town the morning after it had been cleared of the rebels, all I could see was the army and literally thousands of Pakistani flags. The major in charge there had camped in the police station, and it was there that Major Rathore took us. My colleague, a Pakistani TV cameraman, had to make a propaganda film about the \"return to normalcy\" in Laksham -- one of the endless series broadcast daily showing welcome parades and \"peace meetings.\"   I wondered how he could manage it but the Major said it would be no sweat. \"There are enough of these bastards left to put on a good show. Give me 20 minute!s.\" Lieutenant Javed of the 39 Baluch was assigned the task of rounding up a crowd. He called out to an elderly bearded man who had apparently been brought in for questioning. The man, who later gave his name as Moulana Said Mohammad Saidul Huq, insisted he was a \"staunch Muslim Leaguer and not from the Awami League\" (The Muslim League led the movement for an independent Pakistan in 1947). He was all too eager to please. \"I will very definitely get you at least 60 men in 20 minutes,\" he told Javed. \"But if you give me two hours I will bring 200.\" Moulana Saidul Huq was as good as his word. We had hardly drunk our flit of the deliciously refreshing coconut milk that had been thoughtfully supplied by the Major when we heard shouts in the distance. \"Pakistan Zindabad!\" \"Pakistan, army Zindabad!\" \"Muslim League Zindabad!\" they were chanting. (Zindabad is Urdu for \"Long live!\") Moments later they marched into view, a motley crowd of about 50 old and decrepit men and knee-high children, all waving Pakistani flags and shouting at the top of their voices. Lt. Javed gave me a knowing wink. Within minutes the parade had grown into a \"public meeting\" complete with a make-shift public address system and a rapidly multiplying group of would-be speakers. Mr. Mahbub-ur-Rahman was pushed forward to make the address of welcome to the army. He introduced himself as \"N.F. College Professor of English and Arabic who had also tried for History and is a life-time member of the great Muslim, League Party.\" Introduction over, Mahbub-ur-Rahman gave forth with gusto. \"Punjabis and Bengalis,\" he said, \"had united for Pakistan and we had our own traditions and culture. But we were terrorised by the Hindus and the Awami Leaguers and led astray. Now we thank God that the Punjabi soldiers have saved us. They are the best soldiers in the world and heroes of humanity. We love and respect them from the bottom of our hearts.\" And so on, interminably, in the same vein. After the \"meeting\" I asked the Major what he thought about the speech, \"Serves the purposes,\" he said, \"but I don't trust that bastard. I'll put him on my list.\" The agony of East Bengal is not over. Perhaps the worst is yet to come. The army is determined to go on until the \"clean-up\" is completed. So far the job is only half done. Two divisions of the Pakistan army, the 9th and the 16th, were flown out from West Pakistan to \"sort out\" the Bengali rebels and the Hindus. This was a considerable logistical feat for a country of Pakistan's resources. More than 25,000 men were moved from the west to the east. On March 28 the two divisions were given 48 hours' notice to move. They were brought by train to Karachi from Kharian and Multan. Carrying only light bed rolls and battle packs (their equipment was to follow by sea), the troops were flown out to Dacca by PIA, the national airline. Its fleet of seven Boeings was taken off international and domestic routes and flew the long haul (via Ceylon) continuously for 14 days. A few Air Force transport aircraft helped. The troops went into action immediately with equipment borrowed from the 14th Division which till then constituted the Eastern Command. The 9th Division, operating from Comilla, was ordered to seal the border in the east against movement of rebels and their supplies. The 16th Division, with headquarters at Jessore, had a similar task in the western sector of the province. They completed these assignments by the third week of May. With the rebels -- those who have not been able to escape to India -- boxed in a ring of steel and fire, the two army divisions are beginning to converge in a relentless comb-out operation. This will undoubtedly mean that the terror experienced in the border areas will now spread to the middle point. It could also be more painful. The human targets will have nowhere to run to. On April 20 Lt. Col. Baig, the flower-loving G-1 of the 9th Division, thought that the comb-out would take two months, to the middle of June. But this planning seems to have misfired. The rebel forces, using guerilla tactics, have not been subdued as easily as the army expected. Isolated and apparently uncoordinated, the rebels have nonetheless bogged down the Pakistan army in many places by the systematic destruction of roads and railways, without which the army cannot move. The 9th Division for one was hopelessly behind schedule. Now the monsoon threatens to shut down the military operation with three months of cloudbursts. For the rainy season, the Pakistan government obtained from China in the second week of May, nine shallow draught river gunboats. More are to come. These 80-ton gunboats with massive firepower will take over some of the responsibilities hitherto allotted to the air force and artillery, which will not be as effective when it rains. They will be supported by several hundred country craft which have been requisitioned and converted for military use by the addition of outboard motors. The army intends to take to the water in pursuit of the rebels. There is also the clear prospect of famine, because of the breakdown of the distribution system. Seventeen of the 23 districts of East Pakistan are normally short of food and have to be supplied by massive imports of rice and wheat. This will not be possible this year because of the civil war. Six major bridges and thousands of smaller ones have been destroyed, making the roads impassable in many places. The railway system has been similarly disrupted though the government claims it is \"almost normal.\" The road and rail tracks between the port of Chittagong and the north have been completely disrupted by the rebels who held Feni, a key road and rail junction, until May 7. Food stocks cannot move because of this devastation. In normal times only 15% of food movements from Chittagong to upcountry areas were made by boat. The remaining 85% was moved by road and rail. Even a 100% increase in the effectiveness of river movement will leave 70% of the food stocks in the warehouses of Chittagong. Two other factors must be added. One is large-scale hoarding of grain by people who have begun to anticipate the famine. This makes a tight position infinitely more difficult. The other is the government of Pakistan's refusal to acknowledge the danger of famine publicity. Lt. Gen. Tikka Khan, the Military Governor of East Bengal, acknowledged in a radio broadcast on April 18 that he was gravely concerned about food supplies. Since then the entire government machinery has been used to suppress the fact of the food shortage. The reason is that a famine, like the cyclone before it, could result in a massive outpouring of foreign aid -- and with it the prospect of external inspection of distribution methods. That would make it impossible to conceal from the world the scale of the pogrom. So the hungry will be left to die until the clean-up is complete.   Discussing the problem in his plush air-conditioned office in Karachi recently the chairman of the Agricultural Development Bank, Mr. Qarni, said bluntly: \"The famine is the result of their acts of sabotage. So let them die. Perhaps then the Bengalis will come to their senses.\" The military government's East Bengal policy is so apparently contradictory and self-defeating that it would seem to justify the assumption that the people who rule Pakistan cannot make up their minds. Having committed the initial error of resorting to force, the government, on this view, is stubbornly and stupidly muddling through. There is, superficially, logic in this reasoning. On the one hand, it is true that there is no let up in the reign of terror. The policy of subjugation is certainly being pursued with vigour in East Bengal. This is making thousands of new enemies for the government every day and making only more definitive the separation of the two wings of Pakistan. On the other hand, no government could be unaware that this policy must fail (there are just not enough West Pakistanis to hold down the much greater numbers in East Bengal indefinitely.) For hard administrative and economic reasons, and because of the crucial consideration of external development assistance, especially from America, it will be necessary to achieve a political settlement as quickly as possible. President Yahya Khan's press conference on May 25 suggests that he acknowledges the force of these factors: And he said he would announce his plan for representative government in the middle of June. All this would seem to indicate that Pakistan's military government is moving paradoxically, in opposite directions, to compound the gravest crisis in the country's 24-years history. This is widely held view. It sounds logical, But is it true? My own view is that it is not. It has been my unhappy privilege to have had the opportunity to observe at first hand both what Pakistan's leaders say in the West, and what they are doing in the East. I think that in reality there is no contradiction in the government's East Bengal policy. East Bengal is being colonised. This is not an arbitrary opinion of mine. The facts speak for themselves. The first consideration of the army has been and still is the obliteration of every trace of separatism in East Bengal. This proposition is upheld by the continuing slaughter and by everything else that the government has done in both East and West Pakistan since March 25. The decision was coldly taken by the military leaders, and they are going through with it -- all too coldly.   No meaningful or viable political solution is possible in East Bengal while the pogrom continues. The crucial question is: Will the killing stop? I was given the army's answer by Major-General Shaukat Raza, Commanding Officer of the 9th Division, during our first meeting at Comilla on April 16. \"You must be absolutely sure,\" he said, \"that we have not undertaken such a drastic and expensive operation -- expensive both in men and money -- for nothing. We've undertaken a job. We are going to finish it, not hand it over half done to the politicians so that they can mess it up again. The army can't keep coming back like this every three or four years. It has a more important task. I assure you that when we have got through with what we are doing there will never be need again for such an operations.\" Major-General Shaukat Raza is one of the three divisional commanders in the field. He is in a key position. He is not given to talking through his hat. Significantly, General Shaukat Raza's ideas were echoed by every military officer I talked to during my 10 days in East Bengal. And President Yahya Khan knows that the men who lead the troops on the ground are the de facto arbiters of Pakistan's destiny. The single-mindedness of the army is underscored by the military operation itself. By any standard, it is a major venture. It is not something that can be switched on and off without the most grave consequences. The army has already taken a terrible toll in dead and injured. It was privately said in Dacca that more officers have been killed than men and that the casualty list in East Bengal already exceeds the losses in the India-Pakistan war of September, 1965. The army will certainly not write off these \"sacrifices\" for illusory political considerations that have proved to be so worthless in the past. Militarily -- and it is soldiers who will be taking the decision -- to call a halt to the operation at this stage would be indefensible. It would only mean more trouble with the Bengali rebels. Implacable hatred has been displayed on both sides. There can be no truce or negotiated settlement; only total victory or total defeat. Time is on the side of the Pakistan army, not of the isolated, uncoordinated and ill-equipped rebel groups. Other circumstances, such as an expanded conflict which takes in other powers, could of course alter the picture. But as it stands today the Pakistan army has no reason to doubt that it will eventually achieve its objective. That is why the casualties are stolidly accepted. The enormous financial outlay already made on the East Bengal operation and the continuing heavy cost also testify to the government's determination. The reckless manner in which funds have been poured out makes clear that the military hierarchy, having taken a calculated decision to use force, has accepted the financial outlay as a necessary investment. It was not for nothing that 25,000 soldiers were airlifted to East Bengal, a daring and  expensive exercise. These two divisions, the 9th and the 16th, constituted the military reserve in West Pakistan. They have now been replaced there by expensive new recruitment. The Chinese have helped with equipment, which is pouring down the Karakorum highway. There is some evidence that the flood is slowing down: perhaps the Chinese are having second thoughts about their commitments to the military rulers of Pakistan. But the Pakistan government has not hesitated to pay cash from the bottom of the foreign exchange barrel for more than $ 1million worth of ammunition to European arms suppliers. Conversations with senior military officers in Dacca, Rawalpindi and Karachi confirm that they see the solution to this problem in the speedy completion of the East Bengal operation, not in terms of a pull-out. The money required for that purpose now takes precedence over all other governmental expenditure. Development has virtually come to a halt. In one sentence, the government is too far committed militarily to abandon the East Bengal operation, which it would have to do if it sincerely wanted a political solution. President Yahya Khan is riding on the back of a tiger. But he took a calculated decision to climb up there. So the army is not going to pull out. The government's policy for East Bengal was spelled out to me in the Eastern Command headquarters at Dacca. It has three elements:! (I)     The Bengalis have proved themselves \"unreliable\" and must be ruled by West Pakistanis; (2)     The Bengalis will have to be re-educated along proper Islamic lines. The\" Islamisation of the masses\" -- this is the official jargon -- is intended to eliminate secessionist tendencies and provide a strong religious bond with West Pakistan; (3)    When the Hindus have been eliminated by death and flight, their property will be used as a golden carrot to win over the under-privileged Muslim middle!class. This will provide the base for erecting administrative and political structure in the future. This policy is being pursued with the utmost blatancy. Because of the mutiny, it has been officially decreed that there will not, for the present, be any further recruitment of Bengalis in the defence forces. Senior air force and navy officers, who were not in anyway involved, have been moved \"as a precaution\" to non-sensitive positions. Bengali fighter pilots, among them some of the aces of the air force, had the humiliation of being grounded and moved to non-flying duties. Even PIA air crews operating between the two wings of the country have been strained clean of Bengalis. The East Pakistan Rifles, once almost exclusively a Bengali para-military force, has ceased to exist since the mutiny. A new force, the Civil Defence Force, has been raised by recruiting Biharis and volunteers from West Pakistan. Biharis, instead of Bengalis, are also being used as the basic material for the police. They are supervised by officers sent out from West Pakistan and by secondment from the army. The new superintendent of police at Chandpur at the end of April was a military police major. Hundreds of West Pakistani government civil servants, doctors, and technicians for the radio, TV, telegraph and telephone services have already been sent out to East Pakistan; More are being encouraged to go with the promise of one and two-step promotions. But the transfer, when made, is obligatory. President Yahya recently issued an order making it possible to transfer civil servants to any part of Pakistan against their will. I was told that all the commissioners of East Bengal and the district deputy commissioners will in future be either Biharis or civil officers from West Pakistan. The deputy commissioners of the districts were said to be too closely involved with the Awami League secessionist movement. In some cases, such as that of the deputy commissioner of Comilla, they were caught and shot. That particular officer had incurred the wrath of the army on March 20 when he refused to requisition petrol and food supplies \"without a letter from Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\" The government has also come down hard on the universities and colleges of East Bengal. They were considered the hot beds of conspiracy and they are being \"sorted out\". Many professors have fled. Some have been shot. They will be replaced by fresh recruitment from West Pakistan. Bengali officers are also being weeded out of sensitive positions in the Civil and Foreign Services. All are currently being subjected to the most exhaustive screening. This colonisation process quite obviously does not work even half as efficiently as the administration wishes. I was given vivid evidence of this by Major Agha, Martial Law Administrator of Comilla. He had been having a problem getting the local Bengali executive engineers to go out and repair the bridges and roads that had been destroyed or damaged by the rebels. This task kept getting snarled in red tape, and the bridges remained unrepaired. Agha, of course, knew the reason. \"You can't expect them to work,\" he told me, \"when you have been killing them and destroying their country. That at least is their point of view, and we are paying for it.\" Captain Durrani of the Baluch Regiment, who was in charge of the company guarding the Comilla airport, had his own methods of dealing with the problem. \"I have told them,\" he said with reference to the Bengalis maintaining the control tower, \"that I will shoot anyone who even looks like he is doing something suspicious.\" Durranni had made good his word. A Bengali who had approached the airport a few nights earlier was shot. \"Could have been a rebel,\" I was told. Durrani had another claim to fame. He had personally accounted more than 60 men while clearing the villages surrounding the airport. The harsh reality of colonisation in the East is being concealed by shameless window dressing. For several weeks, President Yahya Khan and Lt.Gen. Tikka Khan have been trying to get political support in East Pakistan for what they are doing. The results have not exactly been satisfying. The support forthcoming so far has been from people like Moulvi Farid Ahmad, a Bengali lawyer in Dacca, Fazlul Quader Chaudhury and Professor Ghulam Azam, of the Jamaat-e-Islami, all of whom were soundly beaten in the general elections last December. The only prominent personality to emerge for this purpose has been Mr. Nurul Amin, an old Muslim Leaguer and former chief minister of the province, who was one of only two non-Awami Leaguers to be elected to the National Assembly. He is now in his seventies. But even Nurul Amin has been careful not to be too effusive. His two public statements to date have been concerned only with the \"Indian interference.\" Bengalis look with scorn on the few who \"collaborate.\" Farid Ahmad and Fazlul Quader Chaudhury are painfully aware of this. Farid Ahmad makes a point of keeping his windows shuttered and only those who have been scrutinised and recognised through a peephole in the front door are allowed into the house. By singularly blunt methods the government has been able to get a grudging acquiescence from 31 Awami Leaguers who had been elected to the national and provincial assemblies. They are being kept on ice in Dacca, secluded from all but their immediate families, for the big occasion when \"representative government\" is to be installed. But clearly they now represent no one but themselves. Abdul Bari, the tailor who was lucky to survive, is 24 years old. That is the same age as Pakistan. The army can of course hold the country together by force. But the meaning of what it has done in East Bengal is that the dream of the men who hoped in 1947 that they were founding a Muslim nation in two equal parts has now faded. There is now little chance for a long time to come that Punjabis in the West and Bengalis in the East will fell themselves equal fellow-citizens of one nation. For the Bengalis, the future is now bleak: the unhappy submission of a colony to its conquerors.  "

      "text": "Production of deep-rooted crops in the district is decreasing day by day due to the bad impact of plough pan on the soil. Plough pan is a compact layer of soil which is formed generally under the normal ploughing zone of soil in cultivable lands, reducing productivity of the land. Farmers at different villages said they do not know about the plough pan problem as agriculture officials did not inform them about it. Farmer Nabirul Islam of Fulgachh village in Sadar upazila said he got less production of carrots this year due to  reasons unknown. \"We know this crop grows underground, but it comes out on the top of soil,\" he said. \"I ploughed the land with a tractor, but it ploughed only 3 3.5 inches deep,\" he added. Deputy Director (DD) of the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) in the district Bidubhushon Roy said ploughing at the same depth year after year and cultivation of flood-irrigated rice in muddy conditions is creating plough pan under the ploughing zone. Plough pan may be formed for other reasons, depending on soil-related factors, he added. \"On an average, plough pan forms between 3.5 to 7.5 inches depth. The compact layer depth is about four inches under the normal cultivation layer and compactness is reduced after about 7.5 inch es depth,\" he added. Root fails to penetrate the compact region, so cultivation of deep-rooted crops like radish, carrot, sweet potato, potato, ground nut is hampered and yield is reduced, the DD said, adding that it disrupts the soil's physical and chemical properties, which may reduce the productivity of the soil drastically. Plough pan creates hindrance to the infiltration of water under the soil. Due to this, water-logging takes place and drainage capacity of the soil is drastically reduced, thus crop cultivation is hampered by high soil moisture, said Aditmari upazila Agriculture Officer Biplob Kumar Mohanto. DD Bidubhushon Roy said crop rotation is a very effective way to break and prevent plough pan. Deep rooted crop cultivation like jute after shallow-rooted crop is one of the ways of crop rotation, he said, adding that use of alternate wet and dry method instead of flood-irrigated rice cultivation is very helpful in preventing plough pan formation. \"Deep ploughing is highly recommended to break the plough pan mechanically by disk plough, harrow and modified country plough,\" he said."

      "text": "They termed the current detailed area plan (DAP) of the capital \"faulty\" and \"questionable\" and urged Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) to revise it in adequate consultation with them in consideration of current \"reality\". \"There is no necessity for wetlands and water retention areas all around the city for storm drainage. These rather breed mosquitoes,\" said Gazi Mozammel Haque, assistant inspector general of police, who spoke for Ananda Police Housing scheme located by 300-foot Purbachal Highway. He was speaking at the consultation meeting on the updating process of Dhaka's DAP organised by Rajuk at its Dilkusha head office. Conservation of wetlands and water bodies should be done in light of \"reality\" and not on the basis of CS or RS land records, he said. By reality he meant whatever wetlands are filled up and developed should be accepted as it is in the upcoming DAP. Md Sohel Rana, vice-president of Real Estate and Housing Association of Bangladesh, echoed the same. He added only artificial drainage system would be sufficient for freeing the city of waterlogging. Ahmed Akbar Sobhan, chairman of Bashundhara Group, one of the largest business conglomerates, and president of Bangladesh Land Developers Association, said keeping retention areas for storm water management is an archaic idea. \"Do not make a plan that you cannot implement,\" he said, addressing Rajuk Chairman Md Abdur Rahman, who was chairing the meeting. \"Any attempt to prepare a DAP excluding us would be a blunder.\" Maj Gen Abu Sayed Md Masud, chairman of Jolshiri Abashon, a private housing scheme in Rupganj for defence officials, said DAP should not be prepared hurriedly and should be implementable. Lack of coordination among different government agencies is not favourable for planned development, observed General Sayed, also the chief coordinator of the Padma Multipurpose Bridge.       In response, DAP Project Director Md Ashraful Islam said the provisions for water retention areas in the city's eastern fringe are already incorporated in the DAP based on a study by British consulting firm Halcrow Group. According to the master plan, there is no scope for endorsing whatever wetlands and water bodies are filled up, said Rajuk board member for planning Ziaul Hasan. Echoing him, Rajuk Chairman Md Abdur Rahman said officially recorded rivers, canals and water bodies would be conserved at any cost. The 2,100-acre Jolshiri Abashon proposed in between the Balu and Shitalakkhya rivers in 24 moujas of Rupganj and Kayetpara unions of Rupganj upazila included flood flow zone, water bodies, agricultural lands and rural homesteads that the DAP earmarked as conservable. However, a seven-minister committee later reviewed the DAP on recommendation by Rajuk and altered the designated land use on the basis of a water modelling design to make way for the housing scheme.  Similar land use alteration followed in favour of Bashundhara residential area towards the Balu river and several other private housing schemes around the capital to the much public outcry that allowing random earth-filling of wetlands, water bodies and agricultural lands would cause environmental disasters and waterlogging. Leading environmentalists at a similar consultation meeting on October 30 demanded conservation of the rivers, canals and wetlands in and around the capital as per official records (RS and CS) for environment conservation, ecology and storm water management. Both the DAP and the Structure Plan of Dhaka's master plan for an 1,528 square kilometres area strictly prohibit development of housing projects in water bodies, rural homesteads and flood flow zones that facilitate movement of water during monsoon. The current DAP suggests reclaiming over 2,500 acres of flood flow zones and agricultural land from the grip of illegal property developers, relocation of 3,000 industries and scrapping of 16 development projects. Of the master plan area, conservable flood flow zone, water retention area and water bodies (canals, lakes, rivers) together constitute 405 square km and agricultural land covers 330 square km. With the capital's present DAP remaining unimplemented in the face of opposition from the influential realtors, the government is drawing up yet another 20-year plan. With an objective to ensure \"planned urban development\" covering an area of over 1,500 square km, the plan would cost more than Tk 33 crore for implementation. Noted urban planners have warned time and again that destruction of flood plains and wetlands would only bring about environmental disasters, waterlogging and health crisis for the capital, regardless of its economic status. According to them, an estimated 83 percent of the conservable flood flow zones and wetlands have already been destroyed and grabbed by influential realtors and businesspersons."

      "text": "Torrential rain for more than six hours yesterday caused immense sufferings to the port city residents, as many low-lying areas went under knee- to waist-deep water. Commuters had difficulty finding transport to their destinations, as vehicles remained stranded on roads for hours. Many waded through waterlogged roads or took rickshaw-vans to travel. Poor drainage and waste management systems added to the sufferings of the city dwellers, with many blaming the city corporation for its failure to address waterlogging. \"What's their [city corporation officials'] job? Is it impossible to address waterlogging in the city?\" questioned Julekha Begum, who had to wait for more than an hour for a vehicle to go home in the city's Kapasgola area. She came all the way from her village at Fatehabad in Hathazari upazila on a CNG-run auto-rickshaw. But the driver of the auto-rickshaw asked her to get down at Muradpur around 9:30am, as it was impossible for him to move ahead in the thigh-deep water on the road. Julekha expressed disappointment at the officials of Chittagong City Corporation (CCC). The heavy rainfall started around 6:00am and continued until around noon. The Patenga Met office recorded 69 millimetres (mm) of rainfall in the city during that time, said Met Officer Sheikh Farid Ahmed. The areas that went under water include Chawkbazar, Bakalia, Muradpur, Bahaddarhat, Sholashahar Gate No 2, Kapasgola, Badurtola, Shulakbahor, Bibirhat, Agrabad CDA Residential Area, Probartak intersection, Katalganj, Bepari Para, Muhuri Para and Halishahar Shantibagh. Filthy water overflowing from roadside drains entered houses, shops, shopping malls and other business establishments, damaging furniture and goods. Motor vehicles were hardly seen in those areas while a few rickshaws that braved the water charged higher fares. Tapati Das left her home near the Teachers' Training College in Bakalia in the morning to attend her ailing father at Chittagong Medical College Hospital. Though she managed to find a rickshaw, she could not travel more than 600 yards from her home. The rickshaw puller asked her to get down near Chawkbazar Kitchen Market, as the road ahead went under waist-deep water. Helpless Tapati took shelter on the first floor of a roadside building and waited for another vehicle. \"We voted for the present mayor as he promised to address waterlogging in his election manifesto, but now we are frustrated as the situation has not improved,\" she told The Daily Star. Ayub Ali, a shopkeeper, was seen scooping out water with a bucket from his shop on KB Aman Ali Raod in West Bakalia. He said most of the goods, including sugar, flour and rice, of his shop were damaged. Town Planner Subhash Barua told The Daily Star that waterlogging could be resolved if the authorities were cordial and worked honestly. \"I don't think any effective step has been taken to address waterlogging in the city in the last 22 years,\" he said, adding, \"There is no proper action plan.\" \"As most of the canals in the city have silted up, there is no alternative to excavating new canals to address the problem.\" \"Dredging of silted canals as well as the Karnaphuli river should be done properly,\" he said, adding, \"The canals should immediately be freed from illegal occupation.\" Contacted, Shaibal Das Suman, chairman of CCC standing committee on addressing waterlogging, said the city corporation staff clean the drains regularly, but as the city is surrounded by hills, drains get clogged again with soil when it rains, which is one of the main reasons for waterlogging. He said the CCC was taking up massive projects, including excavating a new canal to address waterlogging. CCC Mayor AJM Nasir Uddin said it was not possible to address waterlogging overnight, as it had been a problem for the last 15 to 20 years. \"It's just the second season after I took office,\" he said, adding, \"I'm trying to address the problem.\" The Water Development Board had initiated a project to build sluice-gates with pump houses at the mouth of the canals in the city, the mayor said. \"The DPP [Development Project Proposal] of the project has already been sent to the Ministry of Water Resources, and the project work will start once the Ecnec [Executive Committee of the National Economic Council] approves it.\" The CCC and the Chittagong Water Supply and Sewerage Authority have taken up a master plan to develop a comprehensive drainage and sewerage system in the city, Nasir said. The World Bank would finance the project and it would be finalised this month, he added."

      "text": "Every time I go to a family dinner I am struck by a bout of Rip Van Winklism--the realisation that life has moved on much faster than I had realised. Those little cherubic, diaper-clad babies I used to cuddle now sport beards, or worse, are going to university. Some of them are even engaged or about to have a baby. People have changed their jobs and no they no longer work for that lovely bank (it closed down in 1992) and Beauty Bhabi is no longer in the picture--having divorced Rocky Bhai, married a Middle Eastern tycoon and moved to Ontario, Canada! This bizarre feeling of cluelessness is ample proof of: a) the delightful fact that I have acquired a few decades in years and been totally oblivious of it; and b) I really need to get out more and meet folks. Being mired in the drudgery of work and finding one's cosy blanket and mindless TV to be far more attractive options than making actual contact with other human beings and pretending to be interesting, it is easy to miss out on the finer details of life that tend to pick up speed while passing by. Hence the Rip Van Winkle syndrome. For those uninitiated in this morbid fairy tale Rip Van Winkle was a kind hearted but lazy Dutch Villager who has a drink from a stranger on top of a hill and falls asleep for twenty years. He wakes up to find, not surprisingly, everything has changed, the government, the people, his youthful face, the kids . . .  \"This is a city where even the most important people fall victim of the Rip Van Winkle syndrome. They lie in the blissful sleep of negligence and apathy while their city's vitality, strength and resilience are washed away in the dirty waters. Coming back to the present time, it's not just me who has been infected by this affliction. Governments tend to be just as vulnerable, manifested in their surprisingly lethargic responses to various natural and manmade crises. From time immemorial we have known--you can even ask a two-year-old resident of this country--that during the monsoon season the incessant rains cause water to accumulate very fast in enclosed areas. Of course it will stagnate if there is no drainage. Do we need feasibility studies to know that unless you have proper, functioning drains, the water will just stay put and keep rising turning the busiest roads into dirty, muddy, swimming pools? No we don't. But the latest statements by none other than the Mayor of Chittagong certainly makes one think whether he and his colleagues have been struck by a strain of Rip Van Winklism. While ordinary Chittagonians are wading through the mini rivers that were once the city streets, trying to go to school, work or home in waist deep water, the city father says that water logging cannot be solved by doing just 'one thing' and that \"the major problem of the city is that there is no sewerage and drainage system\". Say what? You may wonder, did he really say there is no sewerage or drainage system in a mega city like Chittagong? So how long has this water logging been going on? Oh says the stoical ordinary Chittagonian, this is old news--around twenty odd years or so.  And every mayoral election year the weary residents of this beautiful city must hear the refrain: \"this time I will solve the water logging problem of Chittagong city\". The current mayor, it seems has suddenly awoken to the fact that every monsoon season the story of water logging repeats itself like a recurring nightmare in which you are drowning in grimy water (oh wait that's a real situation). He has stated that Wasa (Water and Sewerage Authority) has recently done a feasibility study with support of the World Bank and sent a master plan to the concerned ministry. The Wasa folks are saying that the plan is expected to be approved by the ministry in a matter of two months. Oh, and meanwhile says the mayor, there are ongoing projects that promise to clear the canals and drains. But one cannot help but ask: What have the authorities been waiting for the last twenty years? Were they asleep like RVW?  Actually it seems that they were. In fact, while they were in a perpetual somnambulist state, the seventeen canals that would have handled all the drainage, were being continuously encroached upon, making them thinner and thinner and thinner. On top of that the Chaktai canal, the main canal that connects to the Karnaphuli river and generally catches all the extra water brought by the rainy season and sends it to the river, has gone through the strangest process ever. Instead of deeper dredging which would have made the canal a better reservoir, someone of influence had the bright idea of carpeting the canal bed with a concrete floor. This has served to make the ever narrowing canal shallow, thus retarding the process of holding the flood water and interfering with the natural flow of the canal. The result: a watery Venice-like situation without the romance of gondolas and curly-haired, rugged Italian boatmen.  While Chittagong's city fathers may be waking up to a reality that has been true for the last twenty years the 'authorities' of Dhaka city--apparently there are seven of them--managing its storm-water drainage system are yet to come out of their slumber as year after year the monsoon season brings total misery to the residents. As they were basking in a semi-conscious state, so much has happened. Most of the canals have disappeared and the remaining ones have become clogged with solid waste. Greed has taken over all the wetlands, ponds, canals in the form of concrete, leaving no space for the rainwater to go, throwing the city into paralysis every time there is a heavy shower. Hence the quirky sight of a man in a purple hooded raincoat sitting in the middle of a watery street in front of an open manhole that will miraculously drain out all the water--presumably so no one falls in while wading through the muddy pool. Residents of this city, in fact, have become resigned to their watery urban existence--used to the flood level pants, the frequent abstention from work, school, social activities, the worsening of traffic, the stench of sewerage and rainwater mingling and flowing through the streets. During these times I find myself vindicated for all the times I cannot recall the name of a nephew or how in fact he is related to me. This is a city where even the most important people fall victim of the Rip Van Winkle syndrome. They lie in the blissful sleep of negligence and apathy while their city's vitality, strength and resilience are washed away in the dirty waters.

      "text": "Thirteen Bailey bridges over different rivers on important roads in the district have become severely damaged, causing accidents and disrupting road communication.  The bridges are Ananda Babur bridge, Kachukatar bridge, Duhuli bridge, Kurar Par bridge and Hafezia bridge on Nilphamari-Jaldhaka road, Auliakhana bridge on Jaldhaka-Domar road, Modhupur bridge on Saidpur-Taraganj road, Bahagli bridge on Kishoreganj-Taraganj road, Gomnati bridge and Motukpur bridge on Domar-Chilahati road, Thutardanga bridge on Sutibari-Sardarerhat road, Ramganj bridge on Ramganj-Mirganj road and Tinbot bridge on Domar-Bhadur Darga road. Roads and Highways Department (RHD) set up the bridges on temporary basis 20 to 30 years ago as replacement for the old concrete bridges built in the British and Pakistan eras, which were damaged due to natural calamities like flood, and also during political unrest. District RHD Sub-Assistant Engineer Noor-e-Alam Sidiquee said Bailey bridges are usually set up as interim measures until a permanent concrete bridge is made, and are capable of bearing a load of 10 tonnes at most. Ignoring the rules, trucks carrying 50 to 60 tonnes of goods cross the bridges, making them risky, he added. On Tuesday, the front wheel of a 10-wheeler truck loaded with 50 tonnes of rocks got stuck between two displaced steel plates while crossing the Duhuli Bailey bridge, snapping communication for four hours, said Kachukata Union Parishad Chairman Abdur Rouf. Tenganmari College Principal Mahabubuzzaman Riton said a motorcyclist was severely injured when he fell from the Hafezia bridge 15 days ago as its plates were displaced. Duhuly bridge, Hafezia bridge and Auliakhana bridge were damaged during the political unrest in 2013 and 2014, said Md Moniruzzaman, sub-divisional engineer of RHD in the district. District Executive Engineer of RHD Hamidul Islam said the condition of the Bailey bridges was very bad, adding that his department has put up warning signboards on both ends of the bridges, asking heavy vehicle drivers not to carry loads of more than five  tonnes. \"We've called a tender to build four new concrete bridges at Hafezia, Duhuli, Kochukata and Ananda Babu areas, and we will do so for other bridges soon,\" he added."

According to the administrations of the two districts, people of at least 800 villages in eight upazilas of Sylhet and five upazilas of Moulvibazar are passing their days amid serious problems due to breakdown of communication caused by heavy rains and surge of water from the hills. According to Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) and Roads and Highways Department (RHD) in the two districts, around 542 km of roads have been damaged by flood in the last two weeks. During a visit to Fenchuganj, this correspondent saw villagers and school students walking across the broken roads amid risk of accident. The suffering of the people increases when rainwater fills the potholes. Movement of vehicles is also greatly hampered. Md Humayun Ahmed, a student at MC College in Sylhet, said, \"I come to college from Kulaura, and I have to suffer a lot as the road is unfit for use.\" Munem Mia, an auto-rickshaw driver, said they have to suffer as many roads have become unfit for use, adding that accidents often happen in the damaged places. \"I could not cook food for the last five days as my house has been flooded by the waves coming from the broken roads,\" said Monoara Begum, 45, of Bhularkandi village near the Hakaluki Haor in Barlekha upazila of Moulvibazar. Juri Upazila Parishad Vice-Chairman Kishore Roy Chowdhury Moni said bricks of the roads have been washed away and deep holes have been created in some places, adding that earthen roads have have been completely wiped out in many places. Immediate relief, including food support from the government, is needed to mitigate sufferings of the affected people, said Azizur Rahman, chairman of Bhuksimul Union Parishad in Kulaura upazila. Moulvibazar Water Development Board (WDB) Executive Engineer (EE) Bijoy Indra Sankar Chakrabarty said they have informed the higher authorities of the matter, and sought emergency allocation for repairing the roads and flood control embankments. EE of RHD in Moulvibazar Mintu Ranjan Debnath said, 60.63 km of the roads were damaged due to flood and 80.50 km were damaged by heavy rain. The loss could be around Tk 66.71 crore, he added. EE of LGED in Moulvibazar Kamrul Islam said around 186 km of roads are still submerged in water, adding that the loss is estimated to be around Tk 34.51 crore. EE of RHD in Sylhet Utpal Samanta said, \"The water has not yet receded from the roads and the carpeting has sunk in many places. They will be repaired after the flood.\" EEof LGED Sylhet ASM Mohsin said 216.19 km of roads in the district have been damaged, with Beanibazar upazila being the worst affected. Deputy Commissioner (DC) of Moulvibazar Tofail Islam told this correspondent that water level has risen in Rajnagar, Moulvibazar Sadar, Juri, Kulaura and Barlekha upazilas. Around 2,65,369 people in 314 villages have been affected, he added. DC of Sylhet Md Rahat Anwar said the flood-affected areas are Fenchuganj, Golapganj, Dakkhin Surma, Beanibazar, Osmaninagar, Balaganj, Companyganj and Jakiganj upazilas. Around 1,38,755 people in 466 villages have been affected, he added."

Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a seven-country grouping set up in 1997 and comprises Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand. BIMSTEC region is home to around 1.5 billion people, constituting around 22% of the global population with a combined GDP of US $2.7 trillion economy. Majority of the BIMSTEC countries are situated in the South Asian Region. The disaster management exercise will be a platform for sharing the best practices on all aspects of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), strengthening regional response and coordination for disaster management among the BIMSTEC member-countries, an official statement said today. Delegates from all seven countries of the BIMSTEC, representatives from embassies or high commissions of BIMSTEC countries in Delhi, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) of India and senior officials from nodal ministries will take part in the event. Disaster management was one of the important agenda items the BIMSTEC leaders deliberated on during the Goa BRICS Summit in October last year where BIMSTEC leaders, including Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, were the special invitees. The main focus of the exercise will be on testing the region's preparedness and resilience towards effective activation of inter-governmental interaction, dialogue or agreements for immediate deployment of regional resources for disaster response, said the statement. \"It will help create synergy and synchronize efforts to institutionalize regional cooperation among the member -countries and strengthen the effective utilization of the search and rescue teams for disaster relief and emergency response, including emergency rapid assessment teams and management of mass casualties especially in situations involving breakdown of infrastructure and communication,\" it said. At the end of the four-day Exercise, a publication will be brought out on the outcomes and recommendations of the joint exercise and include agreement among BIMSTEC countries on regional cooperation for disaster management and emergency response."

      "text": "Rising prices of some essentials, including rice, sugar and vegetables, are hitting consumers hard, especially those in low and fixed income groups. Most of the vegetables have seen their prices go up by Tk 5-15 a kilogram in city markets over the last 10 days, reducing the capacity of the poor to have dietary diversity in meals. \"Now I have to spend more to buy the same quantity of vegetables I bought at the end of last month. It's becoming difficult day by day to meet the basic needs of my family with my fixed income,\" said Arjun Majumder, who works at a ticket counter of bus operator Ena Paribahan. The 30-year-old transport worker earns only Tk 8,000 a month, which is far from enough to cover the expenses of his three-member family. He has to spend an additional Tk 5-10 for a kg of vegetables and an extra Tk 4 for a kg of rice now than in the last month. Fish have also become dearer, said Arjun who lives with his family in a rented house in the capital's Nakhalpara area. Consumers living in other parts of the city also had similar experience. Most of them complained that very few vegetables were available below Tk 40 a kg. The prices of essentials are going up at a time when inflation has been on the rise since December last year. According to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, inflation rose to 5.31 percent in February from 5.15 percent in January this year. It was 5.03 percent in December last year. The prices of coarse rice hit a nine-year high last month. In the capital, it was sold for Tk 39.75 a kg last month, up from Tk 37.5 a kg a month ago. In January 2008, the price of coarse rice was Tk 29 a kg, shows data of the Food and Agriculture Organization. The prices of garlic, sugar and chickpea have also shot up, according to Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. Gul Mahfuza, a university student, was surprised at the prices of most of the vegetables at Hatirpool market in the capital. \"I bought a kg of bitter gourd for Tk 60 a week ago, but I had to buy it for Tk 80 today [Sunday]. \"If the prices continue to rise before the Ramadan, I don't know what will happen during the holy month,\" she said. Wishing anonymity, a private college teacher said she bought okra and eggplant for Tk 60 a kg each at a bazar in Mirpur on Saturday whereas she had bought the same for less than Tk 50 a kg two weeks ago. \"The prices are too high for many.\" Asked whether she inquired the sellers about the reason behind the price hike, she said, \"What's the point of asking them the reasons behind the price spiral?\" Traders in the city blamed supply shortage for the price hike. They said excessive rain and hailstorm damaged crops and vegetables in many parts of the country, leading to a drop in supply and the price spike. Growers and traders in Savar and Bogra echoed their words. Jahangir Alam, a vegetable grower in Savar, said heavy rain damaged bitter gourd and wax gourd on four-fifths of his one-acre cropland. \"The condition of crops doesn't look good,\" he said. Seeking anonymity, a senior official of the Department of Agricultural Marketing said many parts of the country saw excessive rain last month when summer vegetables just started coming to markets. The blow to vegetable growers comes after flood hit haor areas and some northwestern parts of the country. Moreover, blast attack caused loss of paddy in several northwestern districts last month, leading to a further rise in prices of the staple. Around a week ago, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina warned of tough action against hoarding of food grains and increasing food prices artificially on the plea of sudden flood in the haor region. \"There is no shortage of food in the country,\" she said at a rally during her visit to Sunamganj. Talking to this newspaper, some consumers demanded increased monitoring by the authorities for ensuring fair prices of the essentials in the markets. Aklima Yeasmin, a housewife who went to the New Market to buy groceries, said heavy rain may have an impact on prices of rice and vegetables. \"But I don't find any relations between it and rising prices of garlic, potato and onion.\" Mohammad Amir Ali, a garment worker at Ashulia, said he had to pay Tk 2,550 for a 50-kg sack of rice on May 4, up from Tk 2,120 a month ago. He also paid more than the usual price for pointed gourd and eggplant. \"My wages have not gone up. It's hard to keep up with the soaring prices of rice and other essentials,\" said the 26-year-old worker, who can earn a maximum of Tk 10,000 a month, including overtime. \"We have to work hard. But we cannot get the required amount of nutrition... The price spike has worsened the situation further... It hurts,\" said Ali. Mizanur Rahman, who runs a 22-member mess at Tejturi Bazar, said he had to spend Tk 3,500 daily for buying foods for the members, up from Tk 3,000 seven to 10 days ago.

Once upon a time, we tend to feel at a later stage of life, everything was peaceful and stress-free. And then, as theology forewarned us all, came the fall, for we inexplicably exiled ourselves from paradise through our own self-destructive imaginings and craving for forbidden knowledge.   And so when I think of the Dhaka of my childhood, I keep thinking of how beautiful and unspoiled it all was, and how we all have ruined it totally in the last forty or so years. True, the monsoons would make the drains flood and stink, but the rain pouring down would wash away the detritus and unpleasant stuff from them soon enough. True, we lacked many of the creature comforts without which life seems unlivable nowadays, but did we ever miss them then? No, in that prelapsarian world nothing bad stayed stuck in the cityscape and we loved its good things forever and forever, no matter how rudimentary the municipal services were, or how basic or bare the furnishings of our homes were at that time. The other day a friend forwarded a link to me about Dhaka in the 1960s that made me think that in this case at least memory did not play a trick on me. The link led me to a posting on Dhaka by Pantha Rahman Reza made on 29 July, 2016 (Global Voices-https://globalvoices.org). But before I go to Reza's posting let me quote the information posted in Global Voices by its staff about itself: \"We are a border-less, largely volunteer community of more than 1400 writers, analysts, online media experts, and translators\" dedicated to promoting \"understanding and friendship across borders.\" Pantha's posting is really a photo-essay about Dhaka in the 1960s and is titled \"Old Photos Bring Back Sweet Memories of Bangladesh's Capital Dhaka\". What Pantha has done in his piece is feature the work of the British aid worker Roger Gwynn who came to Dhaka in the 1960s as a volunteer for Service Civil International and who seemed to have photographed extensively the life of ordinary people in East Pakistan then. The photos are amateurish work I would say, but that not much art is needed for anyone interested in representing everyday life faithfully is clearly obvious in this case; Gwyn has captured well for us a Dhaka that is fascinating, if only to those of us who were growing up in the city at that time, and are in a state of perpetual grief now about its contemporary dreadfulness. Look at the photograph of Topkhana Road, for example, framed by trees that have now   disappeared.   Viewing the slow-paced traffic and the sauntering pedestrians sharing the street with some bicycles and a few three- and four wheelers, one can only be bemused by the contrast between the unhurried pace of life in Dhaka then and the frantic, crowded city street scene that we are bound to view every time we cross this street in our time. And look at the open spaces in front of Victoria Park, Saderghat that Gwynn has framed. Even on a hartal day now, would we able to glimpse old Dhaka so sparsely populated, and as unspoiled and uncluttered as is the scene the British photographer has managed to freeze in time?   And behold thela gari pullers next to their handcarts in front of the photos of New Market. Why is the street all but barren of life?  Where is the hustle and bustle one associates with the New Market ambiance these days?  Where is the throng that make movement of anyone, pedestrian or not, impossible at times now? Surely, the solitary microbus in the street would barely disturb the silence of such a street even at its noisiest then, whereas now one's hearing would be bothered by a cacophony of sounds, whether emitting from cantankerous car drivers in all types of vehicles, struggling all day across the chaotic, crowded street that you have to cross in considerable confusion most times of the day.  Gwynn's Dhaka is truly, magically safe, if we juxtapose it now with the images cluttering our mind of the contemporary cityscape.  Behold for example the photo of children in old Dhaka peering intently at a bioscope from different positions, as if they didn't even need to see through its eye to view the world of magic, and as if they would all see through it at the same time. Can you imagine children now on the streets of old Dhaka doing anything similar? We did so whenever we could, but parents now would certainly shoo away their offsprings from such activity in the city's unsafe streets at any time of the day. Look at the two rare images of Sadarghat's riverfront and Nawabpur Road from an even earlier--1950s--Dhaka supplied for this piece by the indefatigable hispotrian and archivist of Dhaka photographs and artworks Waqar A. Khan. Can you imagine a Sadarghat and Nawabpur Road so full of empty spaces and so sparsely polulated in our time?  As L. P. Hartley once said-- the past is a foreign country. For sure, no passport will ever transmit me to the safe, quite pleasant, and mostly quiet Dhaka of the sixties that we can glimpse in Roger Gwynn's photos. I know, too, that the \"sweet memories\" of this Dhaka can only be revived only through such images retrieved from archives or from memory's caverns. But a city-dweller all my life, and one who has had the good fortune of being  on  streets of some of the world's largest cities, I truly hope to see before my time is out a Dhaka where pedestrians and citizens, young or old, can walk with relative safety and in relative silence most of the day. Our children will never again peer at bioscopes they can access in the city's street that will take them to some enchanted land in some holiday afternoon, but surely Dhaka's streets will offer them in a not too distant future, magical attractions through video consoles and play stations, accessible in amusement parks scattered all over the city; surely there they will be able to peer into distant galaxies where their parents can take them whenever possible. The past will always be the past, but perhaps we can come out of the horrific, chaotic Dhaka we are seemingly doomed to inhabit forever at present. Certainly, we can hope that this megacity of ours will be redeemed by our city fathers/mothers and leaders so that it can be, if not paradise regained, a place where citizens can feel secure and experience pleasant scenes and quiet moments every day, and not be harried and handicapped by persistent urban nightmares in their waking moments.

Bahar Ali along with his family has taken shelter to a nearby embankment as floodwaters have yet to recede in the upazila. \"Finding the house abandoned, the cat might have taken refuge there,\" said Tabibur Rahman said. \"Following this year's flood in the district, many endangered species have lost their habitats and now they are coming to the locality,\" he said adding that they are also coming under attacks of local people. \"We rescued and released another wild cat this morning as well,\" the conservator said. Mihir Kumar Doe, divisional forest officer of wildlife and conservation department of the Forest Department, said that they rescued the fishing cat Thursday afternoon and released it to the lake area of Lawachhara National Park yesterday. The fishing cat, which was once common in the country, is now a vulnerable species, he told our Moulvibazar correspondent."

Sharier Khan, an Uttara resident, made it in two and a half hours. And last night was probably the worst in recent weeks. We have come to know of one commuter spending seven hours on the road to reach home in a corner of Uttara. Also READ: Khamarbari Roundabout - Traffic chaos for poor management\n This morning the Mohakhali flyover was inaccessible for some time, a senior official of the Dhaka traffic division told The Daily Star Online around 12:30pm. \"This along with incessant rain, bad road condition and movements of VIPs contributed to a long and painful traffic congestion which expanded its snares from Airport Road to Mohakhali, Nabisco intersection to Hatirjheel and Bijoy Sarani, and from Hatirjheel to Gulshan,\" the traffic official who wanted not to be named said. Thousands of vehicles on the airport to Mohakhali stretch remained stuck in long queues. A resident of Uttara who uses the route regularly complained that he is experiencing the unbearable traffic congestion for the past three to four days. Posts and comments flood Facebook groups like Traffic Alert showing photos, videos and heartbroken humours in reflections about the overall worsening traffic situation in Dhaka.   Traffic congestion eats up 3.2 million working hours every day and cost the economy several billions of dollars every year, Qimiao Fan, the World Bank country director said on Wednesday. Dhaka's population was expected to double to 35 million by 2035 and without proper planning and investment the city would never deliver its full potential, Fan added."

As for the lucky ones leaving the city for celebrations, they thank their stars for their absence -- this is not their problem! A SOLUTION CALLED SLAUGHTERHOUSE\nTo address this particular festivity centred mess, slaughterhouses have always played a crucial role in municipalities across the world. In Dhaka, the two City Corporations have a total of five slaughterhouses between them. Considering the current state of disrepair and neglect, as well as being placed out-of-the-way, the general population have little to no intention of going there. Furthermore, these are simply not enough to handle the pressure during the event. While the daily capacity is officially 100-150 animals for each slaughterhouse, the lack of equipment and manpower has hampered the potential. Till now, the modern, functional slaughterhouse in Dhaka only exists in the scale models and blueprints. ON A FACTUAL NOTE \nAccording to last year's estimates, 30-40 lakh animals were sacrificed throughout the country with the capital seeing roughly over three lakh slaughters. The waste from this was clocked at over 30,000 tonnes, which adds to the city's already overflowing waste. Considering the spoilable nature of the waste, it needs immediate clean-up and disposal. Even with over 6000 designated sacrificial spots across the country in the main cities, most residents had taken care of things the usual way. This year however, all mayors are trying for a stricter policy in waste management during Eid-ul-Azha. A MISSION IN CLEANLINESS\nAlthough initiatives are yet to be announced, DSCC and DNCC both are gearing up for another Eid-ul-Azha. For 2016, roughly four lakh biodegradable sacks were distributed to collect and clean up the animal waste. Both city corporations, for the last few years have been adamant in maintaining a 48-hour clean-up deadline. While high footfall regions and posh areas got the best of the deal, most localities took care of business as the previous years. The other City Corporations throughout the country are also facing ever-rising figures in waste management compressed within three days. Would you like a repeat?\nWith the incessant heavy rains this year, nobody will want to revisit last year's 'river of red.' For those who happen to have a forgotten it amidst the festivities, last Eid-ul-Azha, after a spot of rain, the streets of Dhaka, particularly the ones with clogged up drainage systems (thanks to animal waste blocking the channels) ended up looking like rivers of blood for a few hours.  Time and again residents are reminded to keep the drains and manholes clean from blood and animal parts. They are constantly requested to put up garbage bags filled with discarded parts for easy garbage collection. Only a handful follow the instructions while most choose to do things at their own pace. A continuation of that would be the basis for another road disaster for sure. Above all else this Eid should be about true sacrifice. Have it in your heart that while you indulge in your meaty delicacies, many will be praying day and night for the slightest respite from the high waters in the flood affected regions. The least a responsible citizen can do is to take care of their own clean up without creating a burden for others. It is the season for sacrifice; do use a bit of your time and resources for a well-rounded Qurbani for the sake of the city you live in. By Iris Farina"

While these projects portray the government's good intention to build robust infrastructure for the country, they also show how we are forgetting the priorities that can sustain or stimulate our current GDP growth rate (seven-plus percent). We cannot think of high growth by keeping Dhaka increasingly dysfunctional. It is a megacity with multiple pains and tribulations which torment ordinary people every day, without troubling the minds of people in power for various reasons. Dhaka alone provides more than one third of the whole nation's output and the ratio will keep on rising since the share of the service sector in GDP is now 55 percent. It is inevitable for the service sector's share in GDP to keep on expanding with the pace of development, and thus Dhaka's importance will increase even further day by day no matter the kind of decentralisation plan our government has in mind. Patal Rail or an underground metro train system for Dhaka deserves to be the number one mega project for the next phase after the first Padma Bridge. Nothing else can be more crucial than to bring mobility to this difficult city--one of the worst on various counts. There is a mysterious silence about Patal Rail at the government policy level mainly because we have a similar construction project of the surface metro train (in progress). The following questions arise: 1) Do we really need Patal Rail when a surface metro is under construction? 2) Is flood-prone Dhaka good for Patal Rail? Can our government afford such an expensive project? All these questions originate from false myths. In response to question number one, we can guarantee that only the surface metro (if ever built) will never be able to handle the growing population of Dhaka. Many megacities have both systems--surface and underground--but the underground is the dominant mode of transportation. Dhaka's traffic jam will remain stubbornly unresolved without Patal Rail even if we crisscross the surface with hundreds of flyovers or metros. New York planners began to build its underground when the city did not have any traffic issues. First, they built the surface monorail. Soon the planners realised that New York will be hard to live in if its underground is not expanded. Hence at the end of the nineteenth century, the planners started constructing the subway and began its first operation in the early 1900s. Since then New York Metro has been a lifeline for the city (for more than a century). It is the most migrant-friendly city in the world where 60 percent residents were born outside the US. Its underground train gives constant mobility to the struggling migrants round the clock and hence the saying goes: New York never sleeps. Dhaka almost never sleeps, not for activity, but for inactivity and noise, for being stuck in never-ending traffic gridlock; one would consider himself lucky if he gets back home by ten o'clock after which the whole city is taken over by a brigade of trucks, choking all the roads. The \"melodious\" horns of outdated buses and trucks keep us awake the whole night, worsening noise pollution. But once Patal Rail is built, there would be no need to control trucks. It would be possible to send half of Dhaka's commuters underground. Kolkata's metro which is just around 300km away should make us feel ashamed. The example of Kolkata should nullify all excuses which some talk show commentators have raised in the case of Dhaka. The issues of wet soil, flood zones, and earthquakes are all equally applicable for Kolkata. But Dr Bidhan Chandra, the then Chief Minister of West Bengal, made the dream a reality in the early 1980s--30 years after his initial idea. It is the decision of the leadership that can make Patal Rail happen for Dhaka too. Only USD 4 billion will be needed to build the basic route from Uttara via the airport and Farmgate to Motijheel--a group of experts estimated the cost while visiting Bangladesh Bank during the governorship of Atiur Rahman. And that money can be collected by gradually drawing from the foreign reserves and forming a separate sovereign wealth fund. Long-term international bonds can leverage the goal too. Alternatively, international private agencies can be deployed to build, own, operate, and finally transfer the project. India has started building subways under private management and international tenders. The reason why Kolkata got the first metro in India is that the city has the least amount of space for roads. While space for roads in Kolkata is only five percent, that in Delhi is 25 percent of the total land. Dhaka's space for roads is claimed to be seven percent, although it is practically less than five percent once we take hawkers, vendors, garbage, drains, illegal parking, and unruly construction works into account. More flyovers are engulfing free spaces quite rapidly. If Delhi's metro can ensure profit from day one, there is sufficient reason to believe that Dhaka's will also scoop profit given the increasing number of dwellers. A study on megacities shows that Dhaka will experience a population growth of 53 percent between 2015 and 2025--the fastest in the world. And the limited elevated train service (if ever built) will be a drop in the ocean. The pace of its progress, as we have seen so far, makes us happy that at least our grandchildren will experience it. In contrast, Patal Rail can be built in less than eight years through technology that will not mess up regular movement on the surface. Kolkata's Patal Rail took 14 years from 1971 to 1984 only because India encountered political instability, fuel shocks, low growth, and a fund crisis over that period. When other megacities in India are installing subways one after another, Dhaka's lack of progress is bewildering. Simply put, there is no alternative to Patal Rail for Dhaka.

The customs authority is not collecting revenue through corridor slip (token given to the people who bring the cattle from across the border) as Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) has stopped giving token for collecting revenue from smuggled Indian cattle for the last three months, said Shamsul Ferdous, customs inspector of Islampur Corridor at Patgarm upazila. Earlier, customs collected Tk 1.5 crore on average from 30 thousand cattle every month, but has been deprived of this revenue for the last three months, he added. Cattle smuggling from India has decreased at least by 50 percent as BGB does not give corridor slip, said cattle trader Mozharul Islam, 45, of Dahagram village, adding that some members of the syndicate are still smuggling cattle. Komiz Uddin, 48, an alleged lineman to BGB at Sreerampur village, said Patgram market is the district's biggest cattle market. Uzir Islam, 36, of Durgapur village in Aditmari upazila, said a lineman to BGB gets Tk 400 per cattle for bringing them across the border. As smugglers pay bribe to BGB's lineman, they never face any obstacle on the the way, he added. Smuggled Indian cattle are being sold openly at cattle markets in Nayarahat, Durakuti Haat in Lalmonirhat Sadar, Chaparhat in Kaliganj upazila, Doikhowa Haat, Barakhata Haat in Hatibandha upazila and Patgram Hat in Patgram upazila. Commanding Officer of Lalmonirhat BGB 15 Battalion Lieutenant Colonel Ahmed Bazlur Rahman Hayati said the paramilitary force stopped smuggling of Indian cattle in order to reduce border killing. BGB men are always vigilant along the border, so there is no scope for smuggling, he added BGB 15 Battalion Durgapur Camp Commander Havildar Saiful Islam said they have been seizing smuggled Indian cattle and selling them in open auction through customs authorities."

      "text": "The Brac Boat School project, which helps children in isolated communities gain access to quality education, is named as one of the 100 innovative projects across the world by global education non-profit organisation HundrED. The Finland-based organisation that aims to share inspiring innovations across the globe to help improve the future of education investigated 700 projects based on their originality, impact and scalability. The Boat School project was chosen because of its innovative approach to provide primary education to children excluded from traditional schools due to seasonal flooding or other water-based barriers, according to a Brac press release. \"Boat Schools stood out to us as a project that needed to be shared with the world,\" said Saku Tuominen, creative director of HundrED. \"Being able to showcase innovations like it marks the beginning of a drive to get all teachers involved in revolutionising education. We will continue to encourage as many schools and organisations as possible to get involved so that we can work towards a positive future.\" BRAC Boat Schools are the product of a simple yet powerful idea: if underserved children living in isolated areas cannot go to school, then the school should go to them, said Profulla Chandra Barman, programme head for Brac Education Programme. In northeast Bangladesh, monsoon rains regularly flood the region, submerging it for more than half the year. Poor communities and families become isolated, without access to public services including education. Each Brac Boat School accommodates 30 children and at least half of them are girls. Brac recruits a local female teacher to guide the same cohort of students through the full primary education cycle. All Boat Schools are equipped with toilets, hand-washing facilities and safe drinking water. The boats also act as school buses so that children can access education year-round. This removes the cost, time and safety barriers faced by poor parents in transporting their children to schools. During dry season, Brac anchors the boat schools at locations that are convenient for all the students. More than 14,500 students are enrolled in 507 Brac Boat Schools across Bangladesh and the Philippines. \"We're beyond proud and honoured to have been selected as one of HundrED's 100 global innovations,\" said Profulla Chandra Barman. \"Boat Schools directly address education equity in Bangladesh and the Philippines, and are a perfect example of innovation, impact and scalability. We're excited to be able to share this project with communities worldwide through the HundrED platform,\" he said. The selected 100 projects cover various fields of education from learning environments and holistic wellbeing to collaborative learning and game-based education."

At a consultation meeting organised by Rajuk for the revision of DAP, the officials of Rajuk, Water Development Board (WDB) and urban planners have raised their concerns over the destruction of water retention areas in and around the city.  Dhaka's waterlogging problem has worsened over the years due to the destruction of conservable flood plains, retention areas, rivers, canals, farmlands and rural homesteads in and around the city. According to an estimate by experts, over 100 realtors have illegally developed projects in these areas. What is shocking is that Rajuk itself has filled up a part of the low-lying area in the city's Goranchatbari to develop the third phase of Uttara Model Town. In addition, the higher authorities have taken away a major part of the water retention areas of Goranchatbari for the construction of Dhaka Elevated Expressway in order to rehabilitate the people who were displaced.  If the government is really serious about implementing the revised DAP, all concerned agencies ought to work in coordination. When reclaiming Dhaka's lost wetlands, opposition from the powerful realtors should be resisted strongly. Also, it must not forget to reclaim the water bodies that have been grabbed by various government departments. In order to make Dhaka liveable again, the capital's wetlands must be recovered and conserved at all cost."

      "text": "Dhaka is a paradox. The more we build assuming we are \"developing,\" the more we dig ourselves into an urban mess: Transportation is a chaos. Travelling is a nightmare. Khals vanish, and roads turn to khals. Public space is non-existent. Housing is in disarray. The current crisis of Dhaka results from three inadequacies: lack of an integrated vision from the various policy- and decision-makers who nonetheless bring changes to the city; inadequate solutions by planners and technocrats unable to take up the challenges of the toughest city in the world; and lopsided priorities in deciding what should be tackled first (example: MRT should have received the highest priority in infrastructure development and not elevated roadways). Moreover, with advisements and funding from a global network of development entities, it appears that Dhaka's destiny no longer belongs to itself. A good city is envisioned, designed and meticulously planned which then is diligently implemented; this may sound obvious but there simply is no other way out of this. While there should be latitudes in design, a city begins and proceeds with a plan, one that has both poetry and pragmatism. Development and investment should follow a plan (in Dhaka, it is the other way round). And plans should be based on \"urbanism,\" on the quality of civic culture and lived experiences, and not on a set of abstract statistics, and economic and technocratic arguments. Such vision-making requires a deeper understanding of the history and nature of cities in the broadest sense, and an abiding knowledge of the particularities of Dhaka - there are particularities of Dhaka that belong only to her. Knee-deep in one city, and neck-high in another, with citizens drowning and swimming, this is perhaps the right time to utter what is special to Dhaka: water! What conventional planning models and development trends lack is an understanding of the hydrological and ecological landscape of Dhaka, and the need for creative responses to that. Regular planning considers the city from a high and dry vantage point; I call this \"dry planning,\" in which the city is civilised if it is dry, and primitive and backward when wetness prevails. The outcome: Water as the basis of a rich community life has evaporated. The river has become a drain. The wetland has become a swamp. And the monsoon has become just a miserable season. \"Most urban planners and policymakers focus on the core city. Even when they are dealing with the edge, they see it in the image of the dry core. Official planning is unable to conceptualise this edge as a distinctive ecology of a hydraulic nature. Planning around land and water--and not land versus water--is the only natural recourse in this particular landscape. An understanding of that requires a simple science, and not a rocket science. However, it needs to begin with an acceptance that in this incredibly fluctuating landscape called the Bengal Delta where water rises and falls, comes and goes, flows and overflows, and constantly shifts boundaries between settlement and land/waterscape, a new intellectual position is required: What should be the perimeter of the city when Dhaka grows indefinitely in every other direction, swallowing up wetlands and agricultural lands, and throwing off balance a precious ecological and hydrological system?  What will happen at that edge? How will population growth and the appetite for dry land be solved? The challenge for urban designers, planners and policymakers will be to show how growth can be addressed by sustaining and enhancing Dhaka's crucial hydro-geographic system.  Dhaka's eastern fringe is symptomatic of a problematic planning. Bengalis have lived with flood on floodplains for thousands of years, but now that they are getting urbanised, and dream of \"plots\" and \"flats,\"they have little clue how to build cities on such landscapes. Areas characterised by canals, ponds, waterways, wetlands and agricultural fields, ultimately linked to the rhythm of rivers--all of which are the original stuff of Dhaka--are being aggressively changed by ruthless land-filling. All in the name of \"model towns\" and \"housing societies\" (The irony is that these projects are neither models nor provide housing in the basic sense). This is an example of Dhaka's ecologically disastrous urbanisation, demonstrated in the plans for Purbachal, and continuing all the way to Balu and Sitalakhya rivers! People who dwell in the core of Dhaka city, walk its streets and live its dry conditions, may not be aware that current development work is based, literally, on liquid matter. Present Dhaka is being built from the fluid fabric of its surrounds by piping and pumping soil and sand. In Dhaka's furious expansion from its relatively higher grounds into the precious region of floodplains, wetlands and \"lowlands,\" vast aquatic areas are being filled up in an unprecedented scale of urbanistic intervention. In fact, all around the city, sand and debris cover once fields of mustard and rice, and concrete and steel rods replace the vernacular of bamboo and thatch. Multi-storied buildings hum with the music of a far-off Gap or Walmart. Freshly laid sand-beds announce the arrival of a Japan City, American City, Green City... When an aquatic landscape at the fringe rapidly transforms into a hodge-podge urbanisation, strange things will happen. Khals, nalas, dobas and pukurs--the lowlands--will get filled to shore up tottering towers, without any basic recourse to safety and buildability, and petit goons with the blessings of big leaders become millionaires, and enter the mystical chain of globalisation. Recall Rana Plaza! Liberal economy, private investments, and burgeoning consumer markets have ushered both new opportunities and unprecedented challenges making Dhaka the most expensive real estate lot in the country. But this comes without a clear urban vision and commitment of wellbeing for everyone and everything. The question of water is not simply dealing with water-clogged streets in monsoon, but working out how the city should work with water in its deepest structural and organisational sense. The first relates to the second. It is at that juncture, where the expansion of the city meets an aquatic matrix, a new kind of city-thinking is needed: a new imagination for a hydraulic urbanism. A hydraulic vision has to begin from the edge of the precious landscape of wetlands and agricultural terrain, ushering a conception of a city that integrates urbanism, agriculture, and flood behaviour. In such a plan, water structures the city and urban infrastructure in which hydrological issues serve as the starting point and framework for urban planning and design interventions. In that ecologically-driven schema, it is possible to think of \"bringing the city into the floodplain and the floodplain into the city.\" Solutions may involve a new network of careful development--streets, walkways, housing and public places--elevated either on stilts or non-continuous earth mound over agricultural fields, gardens and parks. The porosity at the lower level will allow an unimpeded flow of water at different seasons. Seasonal flooding and overflow may actually be allowed in an organised manner for special areas that in dry seasons will become public spaces. In his cartography of the contemporary city, the renowned Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas defined the \"edge\" of the Euro-American city as a frazzled fabric of post-industrial conditions or the tattered terrain of suburbia. In Dhaka, the edge or fringe is the critical site of the next urban dynamic (or battlefield). That geography is characterised by the built-city marching up to meet the \"non-urban,\" a magnificent but precious terrain of land-water mass. The edge is where the dry meets the wet, the \"developed\" meets the \"primitive,\" and infrastructure meets the structure-less. This is the zone where the urbanite meets the farmer, the land grabber discovers his opportunity, and the uprooted often makes her habitation. Most urban planners and policymakers focus on the core city. Even when they are dealing with the edge, they see it in the image of the dry core. Official planning is unable to conceptualise this edge as a distinctive ecology of a hydraulic nature. Without that realisation it is easy to participate in the destruction of the city's hydro-geographical landscape. Nothing short of imagining a new landscape of city-form will offer salvation for Dhaka. The edge conditions of Dhaka present the possibility of re-negotiating the social and economic, as well as conceptual, separation between city and its conventional anti-thesis, whether the village or agricultural landscape. The edge is where new forms of space organisation in response to an oscillating landscape will have to be reorganised, along with newer types of economic, social and architectural opportunities. In the meeting of an older form of the city with agricultural land-form and hydrological landscape, a new conception of a city will have to be developed that integrates the city with agriculture, infrastructure and flood-form. For that, Dhaka has to be built with the dynamics of water. It is for those reasons Dhaka needs a new model of the city. A pornographic image of Dubai or Shanghai, where a brutal consumerist economy dictates everything, or the dubious liberality of Gurgaon or Noida, where maids riot against their mistresses, will not help us build a city on and with water. Are we ready to imagine such a city-form? Kazi Khaleed Ashraf is an architect, urbanist and author, and heads the Bengal Institute for Architecture, Landscapes and Settlements."

      "text": "Sylhet is always a great welcoming venue, whether it is cricket or football. This year, the purpose-built Sylhet International Cricket Stadium (SICS) will play host to the glamorous Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) for the first time. And the fans in this part of the country will also get their own team to cheer, for the first time, with the introduction of Sylhet Sixers in the slam-bang domestic competition. The north-eastern city is already abuzz with festivity as the fans desperately try to get hold of an elusive ticket to one of the eight games to be played at the green venue over four days. The fifth edition of the T20 competition will take place at three venues across the country and Sylhet will kick-start the first leg with the opening match between holders Dhaka Dynamites and hosts Sylhet Sixers at 2pm tomorrow. To marks its debut, the SICS has completed all its preparations and all seven participating teams have already landed in the 'City of Saints'. The participating franchisees made brief visits to the venue yesterday as a part of their last minute preparations. The ground staff was seen busy maintaining the hectic schedule for practice as well as protecting the centre wickets of the venue. Although the venue is popular for its green stand, the gallery is not green enough this time. Perhaps the advent of winter might be a good excuse. Ahead of the BPL, the city has been nicely decorated and around a hundred gates welcoming the teams have been set up. To ensure security, Sylhet Metropolitan Police have taken the necessary steps and have already circulated security cautions to the citizens to avoid important roads that will be used to carry players from hotel to venue. Meanwhile, cricket fans passed another miserable day in their pursuit to get a match ticket yesterday. The Sylhet District Stadium, where tickets were sold, was in chaotic as it has been for the last few days. Three people were injured as a group of aggrieved fans started vandalizing the stadium with stones and bricks. The chaos started after the booths were opened behind schedule. Joydip Das Sujok, venue manager of SICS, said the preparation to host the league's opening day matches has been completed accordingly. \"We are now doing the last moment cleanup, ground nourishing and drills of responsibility ahead of the league opener on November 4. We have also ensured the security perimeter of the venue with the help of law enforcers, officials and volunteers,\" he said."

Without mentioning any name, the PM in parliament alleged that Yunus, pioneer of microcredit and social business initiative, evaded tax on his fixed deposit income and also tax of some 40 to 50 companies that have links with Grameen Bank. In response to a supplementary query of Jatiya Party lawmaker AKM Mayeedul Islam, she asked Finance Minister AMA Muhith to look into the matter and take action. Earlier, the JP lawmaker demanded a probe to find out whether Yunus, former managing director of Grameen Bank, is involved in \"a deep conspiracy against the country.\" Mayeedul, also former chief of naval staff, said, \"This man set up Grameenphone using Bangladesh Railway's optical fibre. Instead of taking action against petty criminals, catch him with an iron hand as he laundered thousands of crores of taka.\" About giving licence to Grameenphone, the PM said, \"When we came to power in 1996, he used to visit me and request for licence to set up Grameenphone. He committed that profits of Grameenphone would go to Grameen Bank, which would use it for giving loans to general people, and Grameen Bank would grow stronger. \"I believed him and gave licence to set up Grameenphone, as there was only one telecom operator at that time. We also wanted to make telecom service available to the general people. \"Grameenphone was third in the bidding process and was not supposed to get the licence. But we gave it licence, thinking that the profits would go to the poor people through Grameen bank. \"It is unfortunate that he sold a good portion of the shares which ought to go to the state. He had turned Grameenphone into his personal property. About 30 percent of Grameenphone shares was in his hand and the rest was sold to others.           \"He had cheated, as profits of Grameenphone were not given to Grameen Bank. \"He is lucky that he didn't take flak for any of his deeds.\" The PM also blamed Yunus and \"the editor of a famous newspaper\" for the World Bank's withdrawal of funding for the Padma Bridge project. \"Following his defeat in the legal battle [challenging his removal from the post of Grameen Bank MD], he got angry with us. He and the editor of a famous newspaper together met the World Bank president and also lobbied with Hillary Clinton [the then US secretary of state] to stop funding for the Padma Bridge project. \"The World Bank later brought the allegation of a corruption conspiracy centring the project and suspended its funding.\" Terming Yunus a \"usurer\", Hasina alleged that he made money and a fortune by fleecing poor people. During the 1998 flood, 70 percent of the country was under water but Grameen Bank staffs tortured people for weekly instalment. \"At that time, we asked the bank not to collect weekly instalment. Our government provided Tk 400 crore to the bank to run its activities.\" Hasina further said Yunus and the editor together moved to launch a party. \"But people didn't respond to the call of the usurer,\" She claimed that Yunus was behind \"the harassment, repression and torture\" of her son, daughter, sister and her cabinet members by US intelligence agencies in the name of probing corruption allegations against them. \"But they [US intelligence agencies] didn't find anything.\" The PM said she had nothing to do with Yunus' removal from the post of Grameen Bank MD; it was the law that didn't permit him to keep the post after the age of 60. \"When he [Yunus] crossed 70, our Finance Minister Mr Muhith and my foreign affairs adviser met him and offered him the post of the adviser emeritus to the bank provided that he left the managing director's post. \"But he went to court and filed two cases -- one against Bangladesh Bank and the other against the government. But he lost both the cases.\" Following his request, the then US secretary of state Hilary Clinton phoned Hasina and questioned her why Yunus had been removed from the post of MD. \"I told her [Hillary] that he lost the cases and we had nothing to do with it,\" the PM added. SHAMIM, FEROZ SLAM 3 EDITORS Awami League MP Shamim Osman and Jatiya Party MP Feroz Rashid slated Prothom Alo, The Daily Star and The Daily Observer and their editors for what they said was publication of false news against ministers and MPs. Shamim demanded that the House enact a law with a provision for punitive action against media outlets for assassinating characters of ministers, MPs and political leaders by publishing false news. The two were speaking on the thanksgiving motion on the president's speech. Amid thumping of desks by MPs of both the treasury and the opposition benches, they demanded that the House summon Prothom Alo Editor Matiur Rahman, The Daily Star Editor and Publisher Mahfuz Anam and The Daily Observer Editor Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury, and quiz them for \"their involvement in yellow journalism and maligning image of MPs\", including Shamim and slain Gaibandha AL MP Manzurul Islam Liton. Following Shamim's demand for issuing a ruling, Deputy Speaker Fazle Rabbi Miah, who was presiding over the sitting, said, \"If you could raise this issue as per the rules of procedure of parliament, I could issue a ruling. \"If you do so, I will surely issue a ruling given that I chair the sitting at that time,\" Rabbi told the AL MP. The deputy speaker also said he was mesmerised by Shamim's speech. In his speech, Shamim castigated The Daily Star and Prothom Alo for publishing \"false\" news on AL MP Liton and \"assassinating\" his character. \"The Daily Star and Prothom Alo are assassinating characters of MPs. Who are they? They published news items based on anonymous sources.\" The influential MP from Narayanganj said Prothom Alo published a news report against him over the Narayanganj seven-murder, labelling him as a killer. Shamim lambasted the AL leaders, who attended a cake cutting programme held on The Daily Star's founding anniversary. He, however, didn't mention the date. Feroz Rashid said Shamim's speech was a reflection of the views of the 350 MPs."

Aliar Rahman, 65, a farmer of Panchapukur village in Sadar upazila, rears cattle in his homestead for additional income. This year's devastating flood damaged his pile of straw and he cannot buy fodder at higher price from market as flood ruined his crops. He said, \"A maund of straw costs Tk 600 to Tk 700 in the market now, while it was only Tk 120 to Tk 150 before the flood.\" He took his milk bearing cow to Nilphamari cattle market to sell, but buyers wanted to pay only Tk 35,000, while the price was around Tk 50,000 before the flood. District Livestock Officer (DLO) Dr Shahinur Alam said flood badly affected around 20,000 cattle and one lakh chickens, adding that farmers were compelled to take shelter with their domestic animals and birds, keeping them unfed. They returned home when floodwater started receding from the last week of August, and found that their piles of straw had become rotten, and even the grass in the grazing fields had died and become inedible. \"Flood damaged my Aman field, and I can't re-transplant paddy saplings in the affected field for want of money. I cannot buy cattle fodder in this situation,\" cattle farmer Manik Hossain, 50, of Kisamot Satnai village in Dimla upazila said. \"So I sold my two cows a week ago for only Tk 1.23 lakh, which could have fetched at least Tk 1.60 lakh after harvesting of Aman paddy starting in the Bangle month of Agrahayan,\" he added. This correspondent visited Dhelapir hat in Saidpur upazila and saw straw wholesalers with heaps of straw waiting for buyers, but farmers did not buy the straw as the prices were beyond their reach. Cattle farmer Abed Ali, 45, of Kashiram village in Saidpur upazila, said his cows and goats are losing weight for want of fodder. He came to Dhelapir hat for buying straw, but wholesalers asked for Tk 700 per maund, which is beyond his capacity, Abed said. A cow can consume four maunds of straw in a month, costing Tk 2,800, which is impossible for him to afford, he added. Samad Ali, a straw wholesaler in Nilphamari bazar, said the reason for the high prices is that they had to purchase straw from other districts at high price, and had to pay transportation cost also. DLO Shahinur said, \"This year's flood ruined 488 tonnes of straw, 371 tonnes of grass and 16 tonnes of concentrated food, creating an acute scarcity of fodder. We have distributed cutting of hi-breed napier grass collected from seven acres of land.\""

      "text": "Farmers are set to get better quality jute this harvesting season as water availability from increased rainfall will facilitate proper retting, said agriculturists and jute industry executives. Retting is the process of extracting fibres from tied bundles of jute stalks. There are four available retting processes and one of them is the water or microbial retting, a century-old but the most popular process in extracting fine fibres. \"We will get quality jute this year because of good retting,\" said Mahmudul Huq, deputy managing director of Janata Jute Mills Ltd, a leading exporter of jute yarn and jute goods. Thanks to proper retting, jute fibres will have good colour and better strength, said a senior official of state-owned Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC) that operates 23 jute mills. However, production may not be higher this season despite increased acreage. Farmers have sown jute on 8.18 lakh hectares this year, up 11 percent year-on-year, according to the Department of Agricultural Extension's estimate. The agency has targeted 88 lakh bales (1 bale = 181 kg) of raw jute production this year. The total raw jute yield was 82.46 lakh bales in last fiscal year, up 9 percent from fiscal 2015-16, according to data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. \"I am not that excited about the quantity,\" Huq said, adding that the growth of plants appears to have stunted owing to prolonged rains in April, May and June in comparison with previous years. Flood may affect the quality of fibre in the northeast district of Jamalpur, one of the main growing regions, said the BJMC official. But crops look good in Faridpur and some of the northwest districts. \"Yield loss might be minimal for increased monsoon,\" said a senior DAE official. Higher acreage will offset the loss of per unit yield, so production is unlikely to decline. Md Mahbubul Islam, chief scientific officer of Bangladesh Jute Research Institute, reiterated the same.  The average yield of jute is 2 tonnes per hectare. \"From that point of view, production may increase,\" he added. Bangladesh is the second largest producer of the bio-degradable fibre after India, and two-thirds of its domestic production is shipped abroad. Of the total domestic production, jute mills consume over 60 percent to make yarn and jute sacks, bags and other items. More than 10 percent are exported as raw jute and the rest is used by growers to meet their requirement for ropes and other items. Jute is the third largest export earning sector of Bangladesh after garment and leather. Export receipts from jute and jute goods edged up 5 percent year-on-year to $962 million in fiscal 2016-17, according to Export Promotion Bureau. About 40 lakh farmers grow jute for cash by supplying to the domestic mills, which was once the biggest industrial sector."

      "text": "The healthiest form of democracy in the world is now being threatened by treasonous mutterings of an uprising.  The ramblings of the disenfranchised may collectively lead to an avalanche of disgruntlement that buries us before the earthquake, affectionately titled, The Big One.  Animals in and around the country have been raising allegations of discrimination, squarely levelling the blame on the government and its actor for propagating a harmful and hateful narrative.  \"Twenty-five trees go missing and suddenly it's our fault?\" a representative of the Association of Blue Whales asked at a press conference organised by the Rat and Blue Whale Association of Bangladesh. In the northern side of the country, under the jurisdiction of the ruler of the North, 25 trees recently \"died by suicide\". That was the conclusion authorities reached when they were unable to explain the fate of the possibly \"illegally logged trees.\" \"Yes, there was a contractor working at the time of the incident, but I am sure he did not do it. In fact, we found etches on the barks that seem to be shaped like a whale,\" one of the investigators said. A recent spate of suicide of teenagers has also been linked to the Blue Whales. The latter deny the association outright.  \"We had nothing to do with this. Teenage suicide isn't an uncommon phenomenon. Plus, what is the evidence we had anything to do with this?\" the Blue Whale rep asked. \"Where is the evidence that this game of ours even exists?\"  \"Also, what about the CORPORATE media that is so hungry to show off their knowledge that they keep writing about what each level of this so-called game encompasses? How are they not culpable?\" he queried. Investigators point to the \"blue whale\" markings that occur frequently in such cases. \"Some of it isn't really a blue whale, but it's a fish, right?\" the investigator said in equal parts stupidity and befuddlement. When informed that the whale was actually a mammal, he had no response.  \"Yes, kids are under a lot of pressure today. Yes, there is growing inequality that can aggravate feelings of inadequacy. Yes, there is too much homework. And alienation. But if it wasn't for the Blue Whales and smart phones, all this could have been prevented,\" he further said.  The Rat members also highlighted the government's unfair treatment. \"We were invited in and now they treat us so badly. Last year, they claimed we ate BDT 700 crore taka worth of rice. Now, they claim, we ate their dam and caused the flood in the haor areas,\" a member said. \"What were they doing when we were eating all these things?\" she asked.  Experts though agreed that rats can eat dams. In regards to the trees, this unnamed expert, who lies to fit a narrative, added that storms may have damaged them.  In good news, ragpickers, or street urchins as we dismissively call them like it's the 1500s and we are back to having the English Poor Laws, joined the animals in their protests. \"Because our university has a problem with free-mixing, they make this rule and blame us? Because we use their toilets,\" a ragpicker rep said.  Indeed, the threads of disharmony seem to be tying themselves in an unbreakable knot. But citizens of this city, so irritated by the traffic and rain, know that the coming election means things are about to change. And by change, we mean basically the same thing and maybe, just maybe, done by different people (but probably not).  Osama Rahman is a Sub-editor, The Daily Star. "

      "text": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has appreciated Bangladesh's steps for providing assistance to Rohingya people and resolving the ongoing Rohingya crisis as he phoned his Bangladesh counterpart, President Abdul Hamid. \"While talking with President Abdul Hamid over phone on Thursday night, Erdogan also reiterated his country's support to Bangladesh in this regard,\" a foreign ministry statement said here today. A Bangabhaban spokesman said the Turkish president made the phone call to President Hamid at about 8.40 pm and discussed matters related to bilateral interests. During the telephonic conversation, the Turkish president expressed the sympathy of the people of his country for the damage caused by the recent flood across Bangladesh, said the statement. Erdogan expressed concern over the prevailing situation in the Rakhine State of Myanmar and \"ongoing repression and enforcement of excessive power\" on Rohingya community. He apprised President Hamid of the steps taken by Turkey in the international arena in this regard. The Turkish president also assured of continuing its role to present the Rohingya issue before different international forums. On behalf of the Bangladesh people, President Hamid greeted the Turkish president and people on the occasion of Eid-ul-Azha and thanked Erdogan for making the telephone call and extending his support for Bangladesh. The president apprised Erdogan of the measures taken by Bangladesh for over 30 years for the Rohingya community who are the victims of torture and persecution. President Hamid said despite having limited resources and other constraints Bangladesh has extended all out cooperation to the Rohingya refugees as per the international laws and rules. \"Though the massive environmental damage caused due to the influx of Rohingyas into concerned areas, Bangladesh has been continuing providing food, shelter, medicines, education and other facilities to them,\" he added. The Bangladesh president underscored the need for ensuring the protection of general people of Myanmar from the violence and immediate implementation of the recommendations of the Kofi Anan Commission. He sought the continued Turkish support in different international forums including OIC and UN and welcomed the desire of the future Turkish cooperation. President Hamid invited Erdogan to visit Bangladesh at his convenient time."

      "text": "Described as \"the toughest city in the world,\" and consistently ranked as unlivable, Dhaka demands new architectural and urban imagination if it were to escape from those tags. Bengal Institute for Architecture, Landscapes and Settlements presents here visions for an alternative destiny for Dhaka that can be actualised. Bengal Institute is dedicated to reimagining Bangladesh's urban future in which dire Dhaka and its regions can be transformed into a condition of civic, social and ecological wellbeing. The research and design team was led by Kazi Khaleed Ashraf, Director General, with Saif Ul Haque, Director, Research Program, and Md. Masudul Islam, Research Program Coordinator of Bengal Institute.  Dhaka is now poised for a new era. Positioned to be one of the most economically dynamic cities in Asia, Dhaka is predicted to be ranked at 48 by the year 2025 with an estimated GDP of USD 215 billion, way above Rome, Karachi, Hanoi and Montreal (UK Economic Outlook, 2009). Now ranked 31st among the world's largest economies, Bangladesh is predicted to take 28th place by 2030, and will be ahead of Malaysia by 2050 (in GDP figure by purchasing power parity according to PricewaterhouseCoopers). But are our cities and towns ready for this forthcoming future? Is Dhaka prepared? The future landscape of the country depends on what we make of Dhaka city. Any national plan will have to consider the urban scenario of the whole country, from the primary cities to the small towns, but particularly Dhaka city as it will continue to play a vital role in impacting places throughout the country. In the absence of a solid tradition of civic urban culture or infrastructural system, Dhaka city remains the sole model of urbanism in the country. It is ironic that every nook and corner in the mofussil (parts of a country outside an urban centre/rural areas) wishes to mimic the characteristics of a dysfunctional Dhaka. New visions will have to consider the emerging urban landscape not as a knotty problem but as vast opportunities. Cities are not merely dire sites of institutional and social calamities that need constant remedies; if properly oriented and organised, they can be economic, social, and cultural engines. Bangladesh's potential for utilising its human resources in the new era of global economy remains largely untapped, and yet there are new ways by which Dhaka (and other towns) can be positioned towards a unique and desirable future. Urbanisation has one meaning, and urbanism another. We urge the consideration of cities and settlements from the perspective of urbanism. Increasing population and physical growth, and their fallouts, mainly serve as the measure of urbanisation, but they do not necessarily make for a civic organism; they do not show how a city can be lived in its fullest human, social, aesthetical and ecological potential. From what was truly a garden city, Dhaka continues its predictable civic and environmental degradation. Even until the 1950s, with its spacious green spaces, majestic trees, crisscrossing canals, and civilised riverbanks, Dhaka presented itself as a garden city and a place by the water. With a new urban vision and political will and action, Dhaka can still be a unique, green and highly livable city that is also responsive economically and ecologically. We have written about the prospects of Dhaka since 1996, in which we have constantly listed the following as parameters for a desirable future for Dhaka: (1) A \"good\" city does not happen on its own; it is envisioned, planned in a professional manner, and then implemented with meticulous dedication. (2) Dhaka is an aquatic city and we tend to forget that. A recognition of rivers along with its banks and canals, and the various wetlands surrounding the city, instead of filling them up mercilessly, is crucial for an economic, ecological and cultural revitalisation of Dhaka. (3) Dhaka requires a radical restructuring of its transportation network in alignment with its dynamic physical and social transformation. (4) Buildings alone do not make a city, but buildings and spaces in a well-knit fabric. Urban spaces, such as parks, gardens, riverfronts, are precious ingredients of a city. (5) Housing is the material and social fabric of the city, and yet Dhaka has not been able to create suitable residential models for the many different communities that inhabit it. Alternative imaginative models of mass housing with greater density and higher quality of urbanity should be explored instead of promoting houses on individual lots and plots. We present here few ideas at different scales and scopes that demonstrate how Dhaka can be transformed into a desirable city. Dhaka's destiny lies in a regional plan\n Dhaka is \"growing\" in its own happy rhythm, spurred on every now and then by fragmentary planning initiatives. This \"growth\" is neither relieving pressures at the centres nor creating a decent urban development anywhere for the city and its regions. Massive areas of precious wetlands and agricultural lands are being filled up to manufacture \"urban land.\" It appears that the problems of Dhaka cannot be solved by looking only at Dhaka city. We propose a \"Dhaka Nexus\" in which the city and its greater neighbourhoods - the region - may be brought under a coordinated planning net. In the nexus area, selected existing nodes (settlements) may be revitalised by relocating and distributing commerce, institutions, and government offices in a uniform way. All nodes and hubs, old and new, may be connected by a coordinated transportation network. The nexus system can support the creation of multiple and diverse kinds of settlements, catering to different needs and experiences. Better quality of urban life in the nodes, with less travel time, will encourage decongestion in existing Dhaka. Once the footprint of the expanded Dhaka is identified, nodes in the nexus and in-between areas could be carefully delineated so as not to affect more agricultural areas and wetlands.  A rigorous balance should be established between Dhaka's urbanisation needs and ecological obligations.  Dhaka needs to spread out and yet remain connected for which transportation is critical. An organised, dispersed \"city region\" will have to rely on an efficient public transportation system that could be a combination of fast commuter train, light rail transit, extensive bus network, and riverway ferries and vehicles. Lessening travel time will be key for the performance of the nexus. In a fast north-south train corridor linking Dhaka and Mymensingh travel time can be reduced to two hours. It is possible that one could finish a day's work in Dhaka city, return to Mymensingh to an air and light filled residence, and enjoy a promenade along the Brahmaputra River in the evening. We suggest three transportation rings around Dhaka that will be the organisational basis of the nexus. The first ring is located along the existing embankment roads of the city and may connect Tongi, Savar, and Keraniganj. The ring could be made up of an expressway, circular fast train line, and circular waterway. The circular road, river and rail system will connect stations along the lines. Radial roads and train lines from key nodal towns will connect towns and hubs in other rings. The second ring may connect Narayanganj, Bhulta, Pubail, Gazipur, and Hemayetpur. Linking with the second ring, we propose creating two new major train hubs: one at Gazipur-Joydebpur as the North Station, and another at Keraniganj as the South Station. From the North Station, passengers can take faster trains to travel to northern and eastern districts. From the South Station, proposed as a new development hub, passengers can travel south, south-west and south-east. The third ring may connect Munshiganj, Mawa, Narsingdi, Kapasia, Kaliakoir, Manikganj, and other towns and settlements. Radial roads and train lines from key nodal towns will connect areas in various regions beyond Dhaka. The creation of this organised network of nodes is also based on a clear demarcation of the boundary of each node as well as that of areas that lie between nodes. In-between areas mean smaller settlements, villages, agricultural lands, forest areas, wetlands, flood-plains, etc. While each node may be planned and defined by distinctive types of residences, commerce, industry, administration, education or other functions, the in-between areas should also be carefully planned for their particular use and potential through land use. Mass transit is the only traffic solution\n Transportation is integral to everything critical to the life of a city: development incentives, land-use distribution, quality of civic life, environmental consequences, infrastructural arrangements, and economic betterment. While there are no instantaneous solutions to the complex issues of traffic and transport, we believe that by organising in an integrated way, and by genuinely understanding priorities, transportation investment can be the impetus for a new destiny for Dhaka. Planners and policymakers need to consider whether Dhaka's transportation crisis can be solved by privileging cars or by mobilising for mass transit. In this city of 15 million and more, only a small percentage drive around in cars, and yet that small number disproportionately rules the roads, and dictates the terms of transportation, and consequently the life of the city. No amount of road widening and elevated roadways will make a dent to the problem. The only reasonable and effective response to Dhaka's traffic crisis is mass transit. We identify three crucial sectors--rail, road and river--where new transportation modes may be implemented rapidly without too much infrastructural and construction challenges. Buses continue to be the accepted mode of popular travelling, and may be expanded and organised for mass transit movement. A revision would require the inauguration of eco-friendly articulated vehicles carrying large number of passengers on dedicated routes. Special bus stands will have to be constructed that facilitate faster loading and transfer. Water-based transportation system for Dhaka, with water-buses and water-taxis, is a natural choice in a waterborne geography. Water transportation can become an instrument to manage and control the riverbanks, and create hubs of riverside development and growth with new economic and social potential. The way Dhaka has turned its back to its rivers may be reversed by implementing a strong riverine transit system. The water link need not only be a circular one along the rivers, but like a vascular system within the city that can connect different canals and water bodies. We eagerly await the metro rail system for that is the only answer to the traffic nightmare. In addition to the proposed lines in the metro, we also suggest a circular rail, road and river line going around metropolitan Dhaka along the embankment system, which is also the basis of the first circle in our idea for Dhaka Nexus. Supporting the metro rail system, we suggest feeder corridors that can be based on a light rail system, one that can be built quickly. One such important possibility with a huge impact is an elevated light rail system from Khilkhet to Dhanmondi via Gulshan, Kawran Bazar and Panthapath. In order to encourage people to take mass transit, the proposed light rail can be linked up with the MRT Line 5 now underway. It is possible that the light rail can be built on the median of the existing roads for the most part. A city with a successful transportation system relies on a culture of walking. For any kind of mass transit system, people need a proper and generous network of pedestrian arteries. That requires the construction and maintenance of proper footpaths that hardly exist in Dhaka. New public spaces can make Dhaka a better city\n It is simple: If Dhaka is to elevate itself as a decent city, it must reorganise the existing conditions of its civic and public spaces. The most crucial thing to do in this regard is to make Dhaka a walkable city. The development of proper public places and civic spaces is central to Dhaka's transition to becoming a decent city, and the only way to erase the stigma of being unlivable. With a climate naturally suited to making a garden city, a bold design based on new imagination, and determined directives from two dynamic mayors of the city, Dhaka can again be a humane and positive place. While open and public places define the civic realm of a city, sidewalks or footpaths are a key component of that system. The sidewalk, the most evident mark of the civility and humanity of a city, represents the culture of walking, strolling and promenading, and getting around without hindrance. This is particularly critical for Dhaka where more than 60 percent of the people walk. Such urban pedestrian systems as boulevards, promenades, riverwalks, or simple sidewalks that are the hallmark of all livable cities are for the most part non-existent in Dhaka. And if they do exist, they are in bits and pieces, and do not create a legible and defined network. A proper walkable city is a civic right. The first crucial task is to revise our perception of sidewalks: A sidewalk is not the extension of a drain, nor is it a three feet wide cover over it; it is a space on its own, it is a public space. A sidewalk in Dhaka will continue to be used for multiple reasons especially for portable commerce and other improvisations. A guideline for sidewalk practices should be developed and maintained by proper regulations that embrace both the necessity of walking and the social interaction of commerce. The pedestrian and the sidewalk is ultimately an indictment on the car, on its ultimate effect on the natural environment (through pollution, etc.), urban exchange (disintegration of the public realm), and social interaction (segregation of classes). Wealth and automobiles do not have to go hand in hand. Hong Kong is a good example where an integrated planning approach has succeeded in maintaining low automobile dependency despite Hong Kong's high per capita income and population density. The success of Hong Kong's pedestrianisation was possible due to the integrated network of pathways that separate car and pedestrian, and allow those pathways and sidewalks to be spaces of their own. A successful pedestrian infrastructure means relying mostly on a set of public transportation such as railways, buses, vans, trams, ferries, and such public spaces as elevated and moving walkways, tunnels, footbridges and generous sidewalks. It is often overlooked that the overall transportation system of any city is intimately linked to the network of walkability created by sidewalks and public hubs. This is particularly evident in the case of Dhaka. With mass transit being the only way to counter the traffic woes of a city like Dhaka, the coming of the metro rail is highly welcome. But the success of the metro will depend on a walkable system: One will leave home for work, walk to the station, and get off at another station to go to the workplace or school or college. On a holiday, a family will walk off to a station to get to a public space to attend an event. After a family meal at an eatery and a walk by the promenade, they will catch another train to head back home. In imagining exemplary civic spaces, we present ideas for two areas, one from the older part of the city, Buriganga Riverbank, and another from the newer part of Gulshan: Buriganga riverbank promenade Dhaka is a child of the Buriganga, and yet it turns its back to being part of the world's most dynamic hydrological system. A radical reclamation of Buriganga River and its banks on both sides is crucial for an economic, transport and cultural reinvigoration of the oldest part of Dhaka. The river can become a sustainable life-blood, and the riverfront a much more organised condition providing renewed recreational, civic, touristic, economic, and transport opportunities for the whole city. To create an active public promenade along the Buriganga connecting both banks, we propose: Framing the river's edge with a new language of development appropriate to riverside activities: Riverbanks are encroached upon or abused because there are no exemplary models on how to use them. An appropriate riverside development will create a defined overlap between city and river, something that is now lacking. Connecting north and south riverbanks with a continuous public promenade: For example, a promenade may link Sadarghat launch terminal to Badamtoli ghat, and via the bridge make a loop to the riverbank on Keraniganj. Walkways, ghats, terraces, gardens, floating islands, and pavilions - all part of a riverbank language - will form components of that riverside promenade. Connecting civic and historic buildings and their sites, and newly proposed public and commercial centres, and large parks and gardens with new public pathways: A new generous plaza - Sadarghat Chottor - is proposed in front of Sadarghat terminal as a public gathering space and forecourt to the terminal where passengers and visitors may assemble. The terminal building can be renovated as a porous and transparent building with better efficiency as a passenger hub and visual connection to the river, as well as a landmark structure on the riverbank. Generating an active water-based transportation by creating ghats and stations for river-buses and river-taxis: By bringing travellers and tourists from other parts of the city, stations can become hubs for new economic and cultural activities in the neighbourhood. Civic corridor along Gulshan Avenue Gulshan Avenue has seen much change, from being a quiet avenue for a planned residential district to a corporate and commercial axis. Despite a lineup of striking buildings, Gulshan Avenue still lacks a proper civic and walkable environment. There are no significant spaces for public gathering, places to go to, and no remarkable sites or structures to celebrate the avenue as a civic corridor. It is merely a road dedicated to the unruly car. The existing scenario can be better arranged with a new installation of exemplary public spaces, parks and pathways stretching from Gulshan-2 to Kawran Bazar via Hatirjheel. We propose the following: Providing a new schema and standards for the sidewalk in order to create an organised walkable network that links key points, hubs and destinations: Gulshan Avenue itself can become a continuous walkable corridor providing for Dhaka an example of a proper tree lined, comfortable walkable street with the pedestrian as priority. A decent walkable city can reduce urban stress as well as transport crisis. If one can walk, there will be less need for driving. Creating generous public places and plazas wherever it is possible (especially on city owned sites): A clearly doable project is to convert Gulshan 2 road intersection into a pedestrian plaza. This can be done by rerouting car traffic around the outer circle of Gulshan 2 in a continuous loop that will also ease traffic movement considerably. The plaza itself can be a lively gathering place for the whole area, as well as outdoor seating for adjoining businesses. On occasions, the plaza can be used for musical events, melas (fairs), flower shows and other events. Converting selected city properties into a better and efficient public realm: The DNCC owned markets in Gulshan 2 area can be renovated into a proper civic centre with new shopping facilities, offices, auditoriums, but most importantly, walkable public spaces and passages. Such an arrangement is also expected to yield higher economic results. In developing each city property, multi-level underground parking is suggested to reduce anarchic parking on the streets. Promoting parks and gardens wherever opportunities exist: Gulshan and Banani lakes are assets to the city. As an exemplary project, we propose strengthening the development of Gulshan Lake East as a recreational park and ecological zone. We also propose transforming existing Gulshan Park as a designated sculpture park with other art related programmes. A five-storey underground parking can be constructed below the grounds of the green park, along with community and food court facilities. Gulshan and Hatirjheel may be linked through green belts of parks, lakeside walkways and pedestrian corridors. All images produced by Bengal Institute for Architecture, Landscapes and Settlements."

Khaliajury and Mohanganj upazilas in Netrakona are the worst affected areas due to the recent flash flood, locals said. They said erosion has hit Goalbari Natunpara, Tatia, Panchgachia, Hayatpur villages of Nagar union; Daudpur, Mukimpur, Gobindapur, Patra, Sultanpur, Baganbari of Chakua union; Jagannathpur, Islampur, Rasulpur, Banuari, of Mendipur union; Gachikhai, Kadirpur, Jugimara, Mominpur and Gazipur of Khaliajury Sadar union; Charpara, Panchhat, Boyra, Batuai of Gazipur union; and Shyampur, Kutubpur and Krishnapur of Krishnapur union. Thousands of homesteads are under threat of erosion due to high waves in the haor waters, said Khaliajury Sadar Union Parishad Chairman Md Sanwaruzzaman Jausef. Flood water normally enters haor areas at the end of Bangla month of Jaistha or in the beginning of Ashar, and this year's early flood has created havoc for thousands of families in the haors, said Krishnapur Union Parishad Chairman Nazim Uddin Sarker, adding that haor people erect protection walls with bamboo and polythene around their homesteads during the rainy season. \"Half of my homestead has already been eroded,\" lamented Suranjit Das of Nazipur village in Krishnapur union in Khaliajury. Suranjit's neighbours, Ranadir Sarker and Alok Sarker, said erosion has added extra trouble for them while they are facing serious problems due to the untimely flood. Khaliajury Upazila Parishad Chairman Shamsuzzaman Talukder Soyeb said erosion may take a serious turn when the rainy season starts in full swing. He demanded immediate steps by the administration to save the homesteads of the flood victims. Khaliajury Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Mohammed Tofael Ahmed said he visited some affected villages. \"We urged the higher authorities to take immediate steps to protect the homesteads of the flood victims,\" the UNO said. Some 30,000 families were affected in the recent flood in Khaliajury, he added. Agriculture also faced a serious loss in the flashflood that submerged 69,710 hectares of land out of 1,84,320 hectares targeted for Boro cultivation in eight upazilas of Netrakona, said the deputy director of the Department of Agriculture Extension in the district.

BAEC yesterday confirmed that the radiation levels in the samples of water, dead fish and ducks collected from the flashflood-hit haor region were within the permissible limits. In a notice issued yesterday, the fisheries department said it would withdraw the ban on fishing at Hakaluki haor from today, our Moulvibazar correspondent reports quoting Sultan Mahmud, senior fisheries officer in Kulaura upazila of Moulvibazar. The ban on fishing in the haor was imposed on April 17 following the death of fishes in the haor areas after the early flash-flood. The production of fish from Hakaluki haor is about 14,000 metric tonnes each year, but in the flash floods that hit relatively early, there was a 25 metric tonnes loss, says AKM Shafiquzzaman, fisheries officer of Moulvibazar Fisheries Department. To recoup with the losses, 18 lakh fish fry will be released into the haor this June, Shafiquzzaman said."

      "text": "Bangladesh is a deltaic land created and flushed by numerous rivers. It had 1400 to 1500 rivers in the 11th century, which was reduced to 7 to 8 hundred due to various natural anthropogenic factors over time. Presently, no more than 400 rivers with numerous tributaries and distributaries are existent in the country, out of which 25 rivers are already dead or moribund. Dozens of others are drying up gradually. Only around 100 rivers have adequate navigable depths round the year at the moment. The total river route in the country in 1971 was 24,140 km, covering 8 percent of the country's area, which has now been reduced to 3800 km only during the lean flow period. There are three principal river systems in the country: (a) Barak-Meghna; (b) Brahmaputra-Jamuna; and (c) Ganga-Padma. Teesta is an important water flow for the country because it is the terminal tributary for the Brahmaputra. These systems and all other rivers carry an annual water load of about 1074 billion cubic meters (bcm) from the upstream sources. Rainfall adds another 251 bcm of water volume. Around 150 bcm of water is required to be available in the riverbeds to maintain navigability. Bangladesh is historically a country of riverine agro-economy. This small land is burdened with an increasing populations. Over time agriculture is going to lose the position as highest contributor to the GDP. There has been a gradual shifting of its economy towards industrialisation and other drivers of economic prosperity. The country's population and eco-insensitive industrial development are now the major factors behind river degradations through grabbing/cordon structures as well as pollution of the rivers. River degradation through physical contaminants   Physical Degradations: These are manifested by reduced flow, siltation, erosion, cordon structures and encroachment. Any exotic entity in the river water is itself a polluter.  Reduction of flows: Flow reduction becomes critical in 97 percent of the rivers in the dry season (November to March). Causes of flow reduction include: flow diversion and water withdrawal in the upstream region mainly by India in all 54 rivers, and partly by China and Myanmar, through damming or other obstructive or diversionary infrastructures. Indian River Linking Project (IRLP) and Tipaimukh Dam will be last nails in the coffin. Dried up water flows is provocative to more polluting interference in water contents. Silt deposition: Prolonged silt deposition meanwhile killed 187 rivers (28 percent of the rivers). The rivers of Bangladesh carry about 3.8 billion tonnes of silt every year and 40-45 million tonnes get deposited on the river beds. Many rivers have lost their depths and about 77 percent of the river-mouths are silted. Silt deposit rate has increased in 574 rivers (i.e. 86 percent). Reduced water flows from upstream are a prominent causative factor in more siltation and consequent impacts like river bed elevation, reduced water holding capacity and more river bank erosion. River Bank Erosion:  41 percent of rivers in Bangladesh suffer from erosion. During the rainy season, erosion increases in some rivers due to raised river beds and reduced water holding capacity and that causes further erosion during the next monsoon. Cordon Structures: Around 500 flood control, drainage and irrigation projects, undertaken around the last 60 years, have disconnected 35 million hectors of land from the rivers. Harmful structures like regulators or sluice gates and cross dams were built on many rivers causing immense negative impacts. Cross dams and short length bridges made in the name of development are now the main river-killers in the country. There is cause to worry that the recent governmental initiative \"Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100\" is going to be the replica of the same.  Encroachment: 158 rivers lost their width from unauthorised encroachments and this process is quite unhindered due to strong socio-political links of a section of grabbers. Instrumental and organic dumping: Different abandoned parts of marine vehicles like wooden boats, steamers, fishing nets, boundaries used in dry seasons for fishing traps, plastics and other non-degradable items, household materials, rejected foods-fruits-vegetables etc. are also causing further pollutions. Untreated hospital wastes: Hospital waste and highly poisonous and infective materials are getting mixed with water all over the country throughout the year, contributing to a severe biological pollution of rivers and wetlands.   Reduced quality of water, more sediments, narrowing, cordoning, diversions, dry ups, commercialisation, so called development projects, unplanned re-excavations, sluggish flows due to the reasons mentioned above accelerate pollution and induce deaths of rivers. Chemical contamination: Threat to public health\n About 11 percent of the rivers in Bangladesh are polluted by industrial wastes. Further escalations are noted from agro-chemicals, marine vehicular discharges and wastes and municipal and domestic wastes. As per a governmental study, rivers around Dhaka, namely the Buriganga, Shitalakshya, Turag, Balu, Bangshi and Dhaleswary, have earned notorious reputations due to very high level of pollutions from industrial wastes (60 percent), and municipal/household drainage of toilet wastes (30 percent). We have heard a former state minister of water resources in the late 90's say that a ten feet thick poly bags layer had caused \"carpeting\" on the Buriganga river bed! The newly built Hatirjheel project is still pouring its dirty wastes into river Balu through the Narai khal without proper treatment. Especially during the winter season, all these rivers become absolutely filthy and poisonous; devoid of oxygen and aquatic biodiversity. The government seems quite incapable or shy in executing the decisions for mandatory ETP fixation in the industrial plants.    River pollution is violating the people's right to safe water and liveable environment. Rivers are not pipelines, these are our lifelines. We must protect the rivers!  Excreta play a significant role in polluting the rivers in Bangladesh. In spite of prolonged national drives, we are yet to achieve a satisfactory sanitation management system. Rivers and canals are major disposal receptacles for human and animal excreta as well as dead animal bodies, especially by riverside inhabitants. Media sources revealed a few years back that the number of small hanging latrines on both sides of the Karnaphuli was about 1.5 lakhs. It is not a stretch of imagination to say that the rivers and water bodies are considered as the drains in Bangladesh.  About 1.6 million tonnes of chemical fertilisers and 4-5 thousand tonnes of pesticides are used for agriculture every year. Though illegal worldwide, 9 out of 12 Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), also known as the dirty dozen, are also being used all over the country for agricultural and household purposes. These are smuggled-in items proven harmful to human health, namely: Eldrin, Dieldrin, Chlordane, DDT, Endrin, Heptachlor, Mirax and Toxafen etc. A huge portion of these dangerous items are carried by rain water and flood, contaminating the rivers, wetlands, ponds, soil and finally entering the food chain, causing numerous deadly diseases including cancers. Marine vehicular discharges: This chemical contamination results in obnoxious chemical pollution in river-water and gets deposited on river beds. Amount of such category is said to be 1.7 to 2.4 billion tonnes, causing 35  million tonnes of silt deposits in the rivers, every year. Trans-boundary mixed pollution Trans-boundary river pollution is also a significant factor for Bangladesh. All the plain land and hilly rivers are carrying huge amount of wastes from a big stretch of India surrounding Bangladesh and a part of Myanmar. The components include eroded river bank soil, peeled off hilly stones, boulders, construction materials from urban developmental projects and hydro-power plants and dam constructions, contaminated mountains and glaciers, run off urban wastes, coal dust, gravels sandy flood, suspected radioactive materials, and municipal wastes from Meghalaya, Assam, Tripura, West Bengal and bordering Myanmar. Bangladeshi rivers work as the gate way to enormous amounts of waste from the upstream region. This problem can only be solved through trans-boundary planning and cooperation. Health impacts of chemical pollutants of rivers Chemical pollutants of water induce toxic impacts on all the living entities including human beings through water, soil and even air. Common diseases from the polluted rivers are: skin allergy and inflammations, gastroenteritis, typhoid and paratyphoid, liver diseases like hepatitis, jaundice, upper respiratory inflammations, and any of these areas may develop even deadlier cancers. The population around the river banks is, in a true sense, a permanently vulnerable society, with higher morbidity and mortality rates, prolonged sickness, having less work capacity and costly lives leading to more poverty.    World Bank and government study performed by IWM                 In general, we know that Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) has a limited capacity (around 30 percent) of managing toilet discharges and the rest goes to the rivers around Dhaka city through the WASA storm water drainage but without formal permission from the organisation. Side by side, the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) has the capacity of disposing 45 percent of the municipal wastes. The rest remain lying in or around roadside bins; often find their way back into households through footwear and add to the the cyclic human family disease process. A notable amount flows into the rivers through the roadside drains. There was a governmental study by the IWM in 2007 on the pollutions in the water courses around Dhaka namely: Buriganga, Shitalakshya, Turag, Balu, Bangshi, Dhaleswari and Tongi Khal. The study correctly revealed that 60 percent pollution is caused by the industries, 30 percent by WASA and DCC and the rest by others. This study, in addition to other matters, dealt with the biological pollutions of the rivers around Dhaka city. Key points on findings from the biological part of the study \"Comparative Disease prevalence between watershed (6 rivers around the city of Dhaka) and Control Populations (riverside Tangail town)\" reveals: 1. There is strong co-relation between disease and river pollutions. 2. Industrial pollution is widespread and easily affects drinking water. 3. Health care cost of pollution represents 21.5 percent of annual income in Hazaribag area. 4. Jaundice, skin diseases and diarrhoea are very high in watershed areas. 5. Men and children are more affected in watershed areas. 6. Men are more affected by jaundice than women. 7.Infants in control area are less affected by jaundice and diarrhoea. 8. There is co-relation between jaundice and diarrhoea in watershed areas. 9. Major source of water contamination is from piped supply. 10. Productivity loss of polluted land is estimated to be 40 percent. 11. Vegetable cultivation in river beds is severely damaged by polluted water. 12. There is no fishing activity in dry season in rivers and canals in greater Dhaka. 13. In rainy season, some fish appear here with insignificant reduction in amount but there is a notable number of declining species. 14. The rice-vegetable-fish reduction in the river basin areas is affecting nutrition. 15. Widespread contamination has caused scarcity of safe surface water sources in Bangladesh, except few natural springs in hilly areas. 16. According to IWM, water is so polluted at the intake point that it can't be treated to become safe for drinking. 17. Rivers around Dhaka are at the height of contamination, not only in dry season, but also posing high threat of health calamities. Core essence of river pollution and degradation: wrong approach towards lifeline Historically and traditionally, men have wanted to conquer rivers by cordoning them with long embankments, dams, barrages, crossroads, short-span bridges and culverts. People consider rivers as drains and throw all their wastes and garbage into it. This is done not only by individuals but also by corporations and governments. Bangladesh is no exception. But currently the choice for this commercial approach towards the rivers is taking the reverse course worldwide, and sensible people are adopting an ecological approach towards rivers. Science, conscience, awareness and a sense of justice is the way of success to stop the atrocities and pollution of our rivers.   River pollution is violating the people's right to safe water and liveable environment. Rivers are not pipelines, these are our lifelines. We must protect the rivers!

      "text": "Onion prices have come down a little but are still way too high. Yesterday, locally-grown onions were selling for Tk 90 a kg at the kitchen market in the capital's Karwan Bazar. However, the prices ranged between Tk 95 and Tk 100 in the grocery stores in the city. Onions imported from India were being sold between Tk 75 and Tk 80 per kg. A few days ago, the price of locally-produced onions shot up to Tk 100 and over after the neighbouring country imposed $850 as Minimum Export Price for each tonne of onions. India reset the MEP after nearly two years to increase supply in its domestic market and curb price hike there. The country, which itself has a huge demand for the essential cooking ingredient, is a major source of onion for Bangladesh. The retail prices in New Delhi have touched Rs 80 for a kg owing to tight supply, according to reports by some Indian media outlets. That hike eventually had an impact on the Bangladeshi markets and the prices here spiralled, putting people in trouble. \"Onions have become too expensive,\" Saiful Islam, who works at a private firm, had said after buying half a kg for Tk 50, a few days ago. Onion prices which also rocketed outside the capital have started to drop. For example, each kg of locally-grown and imported onions were selling for Tk 80 and Tk 65 in the kitchen markets in Dinajpur. They were higher the day before yesterday. A week ago, the price of per kg of the imported ones was Tk 58. Sirajul Islam, who runs a small restaurant in Dinajpur, said, \"My family runs on the profit [of my business]. How can I do business if the price stays so high?\" Sheikh Ali Ahmed, a retired banker living in Khulna city, said he was struggling to meet his family expenses as the prices of other essentials, including rice, were too high. Onion prices started soaring since flood hit the northern region of the country in August. That month, per kg of onions was sold at just Tk 25 per, said Asadul Islam, who lives in Dinajpur.  Prices shot up further by the end of September and each kg of the imported onions was sold at Tk 65 in mid-October. There was further price hike following crop loss in heavy rains in the neighbouring country. Downpour also affected early varieties of locally grown onions at a time when old stocks were running out. \"Onion prices may remain at this level for another week,\" Narayan Chandra Saha, a wholesaler at Shyambazar market in the capital, said a few days ago. Harun Ur Rashid, president of Importers and Exporters Group of Hili Land Port, said onion prices were soaring in the Indian domestic market. Besides, bad weather and flood in August also damaged onion fields, he said. Harun said traders were losing interest in importing onions from India because of the $850 MEP. Importers could import onions at $500 per tonne prior to India's move, according to traders. The latest MEP for onion exports will remain effective until December 31, the Director General of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of India said in a notification on November 23. Narayan said prices of onions may drop in the coming months because of arrival of early varieties of locally grown bulbs. \"We are also getting onions imported from China and Egypt.\" Harun urged the Bangladesh government to facilitate faster import of bulb onions from other countries."

      "text": "At least 20 syndicates are making a fortune by providing gas, power and water illegally to people living in the capital's biggest slum, Korail Bosti. They get an estimated Tk 1.5 crore per month from slum dwellers and a major portion of the money is spent to \"manage\" the local police station and a section of employees of the three utility service providers. Home to around one lakh people, who include 28,000 voters, Korail Bosti is spread over 90 acres of government land in Mohakhali. People have been living there since 1990, according to government officials. These correspondents talked to over 50 locals and several syndicate members to get an insight into the slum's complex web of money and power. The residents reckon that there are at least 10,000 illegal gas connections, and 15,000 water and as many electricity connections at the slum. Under the arrangements made by the syndicates, each gas connection costs at least Tk 500 for households and Tk 1,500 for hotels and other commercial users. A family has to pay Tk 170 per month for using a light bulb and Tk 170 for an electric fan, residents say.  A shop owner pays Tk 900 a month for a light bulb and Tk 600 for a refrigerator. To get tap water for five minutes a day, one has to pay Tk 150 per month, for 10 minutes Tk 300 and for 20 minutes Tk 600. Every syndicate has its own staff, including lineman, rent collector and manager. The number of staff depends on the number of homes their illegal services cover. To set up the connections and run the unauthorised services, the syndicates get technical support from some employees of local water, power and gas supply offices in exchange for bribe. Between 10th and 15th day of every month, the payment must be paid to the rent collectors appointed by the syndicates.  \"In case of default, the lineman of the syndicate snaps the connection,\" said Tohur Ali, 65, who lives in Ershadnagar area of Korail Bosti. \"Lineman restores the connection after we settle the bill.\" Nur Banu, who ran one of such syndicates for around two years till November 2015, told this newspaper that her collection was Tk 4 lakh per month. \"I had to pay Tk 1 lakh to Banani policemen, Tk 50,000 to the local power office, Tk 10,000 to local Wasa office and Tk 1 lakh to my staff,\" she said. Syndicates divide areas among themselves to run the illegal business and each one of them provides services to a certain number of houses.   For example, the syndicate run by Junaid, Nayeb Ali, Sohag and Natib Ali supply water and electricity to around 5,000 houses in Ershadnagar and Beltoli. A member of the syndicate said they get Tk 10 lakh per month from their areas. One syndicate alone never provides all the three utility services. Their illegal business had earlier led to bloodshed on several occasions.  At least three syndicate members were killed in the last seven years in the slum over internal feuds or establishing supremacy, according to locals.  Nur Banu said her husband Dulal Sardar was killed by his rivals Junaid, Nayeb Ali and others in 2014. Those involved in the murder later grabbed her business after evicting her from her house in the slum in November 2015. Mohammad Bashir, who was engaged in providing water service in the slum, was killed by rivals five years ago. \"Criminals first fired shots at his [Bashir's] house at TNT colony house injuring his child. A few days later, he was shot dead inside the slum,\" a member of a syndicate said. In another incident, one Mosharraf was killed six years back over establishing supremacy in the slum. Earlier this year, a garment worker was raped at a house inside the slum allegedly by four goons involved with a syndicate, according to the FIR the victim filed with Banani Police Station.   Because of low house rents, hawkers, small shopkeepers, roadside vendors, rickshaw and van pullers, CNG drivers and domestic helps and workers involved in garment, construction and transport sectors live in Korail Bosti. There are people who come from outside the capital to stay here for a certain period of time following natural disasters like river erosion and flood. The number of slum dwellers increases before the Eid-ul-Azha, Eid-ul-Fitr and Shab-e-Barat.  \"You will get an 80 to 100 sq-feet room at Tk 1,500 to 2,500 per month excluding the utility service costs,\" said Moyez Ali, who lives in Jamai Bazar area of Korail Bosti. Around 30,000 families living in the slum get electricity and water services while almost all the families have gas facility to cook meal, Abdus Sobhan, president of Korail Bosti Unnayan Committee-1, told The Daily Star. Mofizur Rahman, elected councillor of ward-20, said all gas connections at the slum are illegal and the lines pose a very high risk of danger. And fifty percent of water and electricity supplies are unauthorised, said the councillor and several other well-informed sources. Mofizur added they are trying to legalise all the services. Banani Police Station Officer-in-Charge (investigation), Md Abdul Matin, binned as baseless the allegation against police of taking bribe from the syndicates.  \"We don't allow illegal utility services in the slum,\" Matin said. He also added that the Banani Police Station assist the mobile court when it launches drive against illegal connections. Israfil Hossain Akanda, executive engineer of Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Wasa), Mohakhali, said he has no idea about any syndicate illegally supplying water to slum people with the assistance of dishonest Wasa staffs. He added Wasa has installed 1,000 meters with connections to provide water to the slum's low-income people. Local officials claim their services cover the entire Korail slum. But several syndicate members wishing anonymity said Wasa's meters are connected to around 10,000 houses. And the syndicates are providing water supply to 20,000 to 25,000 houses. Md Kamrul Islam, sub-divisional engineer of Dhaka Electric Supply Company (Desco), Gulshan office, said they have set up 35 large-size \"pole meters\" to supply power to the slum people. However, no official could say exactly how many Korail residents get power supply through those meters. Some syndicate members and locals said Desco can supply electricity to 4,000 to 5,000 houses. Officials of Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited say they don't provide any gas connection to Korail slum. HM Ali Ashraf, director (operations) of Titas Gas, said he has lost count of how many times they have snapped illegal gas connections at Korail slum. \"We launch drives against illegal gas connections there regularly. But things get back to square one after a few days,\" he added. Responding to a query, Ashraf said he is unaware of any Titas staff's links to illegal gas supply at Korail. But another official of Titas, wishing anonymity, said a section of their employees and law enforcers assist the syndicates in the illegal business involving crores of taka."

      "text": "The Latest on the explosion in Somalia's capital (all times local): 7:30 a.m. Qatar's foreign minister says his country's diplomatic mission in Somalia was hit by the massive truck bombing in Mogadishu. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said on Twitter early Monday morning: \"The attack on (hashtag)Qatar diplomatic mission in Mogadishu will not deter our support for (hashtag)Somalia's democracy, security and stability.\" He did not elaborate. It was unclear if any Qataris were hurt in the blast. Officials in Doha did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Somalia has found itself torn by the boycott by four Arab nations of Qatar. Saudi Arabia is the Somali government's biggest benefactor, while the United Arab Emirates has trained the country's military and launched a high-profile aid appeal this year. Somalia has meanwhile allowed Qatari aircraft to increasingly fly through its airspace as Arab nations have closed theirs off. A Somali state in September broke with Somalia's central government in Mogadishu, saying it backed the boycotting nations. 12:45am Somalia's information minister Abdirahman Osman says the death toll from Saturday's truck bombing in Mogadishu has risen to 276, with about 300 people injured. It is the deadliest single attack in Somalia's history. The toll is expected to rise. Somalia's government has blamed the al-Shabab extremist group, which has not yet commented. 12:40 am UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says he is \"sickened\" by the deadliest single attack in Somalia's history. Guterres in a tweet Sunday night urged \"unity in the face of terrorism.\" Saturday's truck bombing in Mogadishu killed at least 231 people. Another 275 are hurt. Somalia's government has blamed the al-Shabab extremist group, which has not yet commented. Officials fear the death toll will rise. A general view shows the scene of an explosion in KM4 street in the Hodan district of Mogadishu, Somalia October 14, 2017. Photo: Reuters\n 10:05pm\n The United States is condemning \"in the strongest terms\" the deadliest single attack in Somalia's history. The State Department statement expresses condolences to victims and wishes a quick recovery for the injured. Saturday's truck bombing in Mogadishu killed at least 231 people. Another 275 are hurt. The US calls the attack \"senseless and cowardly\" and says it will stand with Somalia in its fight against extremism. 6:35 pm Qatar says its embassy was \"severely damaged\" in the deadly truck bombing in Somalia's capital. A foreign ministry statement Sunday says the embassy's charge d'affaires was \"slightly injured in the explosion but he is now in a good health, and the rest of staff are fine.\" Saturday's blast killed at least 231 people. It is the deadliest ever attack in the Horn of Africa nation. 5:50 pm The United Nations special envoy to Somalia calls the deadly truck bombing in the capital \"revolting\" and says an unprecedented number of civilians have been killed. A statement from Michael Keating says: \"I am shocked and appalled by the number of lives that were lost in the bombings and the scale of destruction they caused.\" Saturday's blast struck a densely populated neighborhood of Mogadishu. The death toll has risen to 231. It is the deadliest ever attack in the Horn of Africa nation. Keating says the UN and African Union are supporting the Somali government's response with \"logistical support, medical supplies and expertise.\" 5:45pm The US Africa Command says US forces have not been asked to provide aid following Saturday's deadly attack in Somalia's capital. A US Africa Command spokesman tells The Associated Press that first responders and local enforcement would handle the response and \"the US would offer assistance if and when a request was made.\" A Somali senator says the death toll from the massive truck bomb blast in Mogadishu has risen to 231, with 275 people injured. It is the deadliest ever attack in the Horn of Africa nation. 5:35pm Angry protesters have taken to the streets in Somalia's capital a day after a massive truck bomb killed at least 231 people. The protesters who gathered at the scene of the blast are chanting against the attack, the deadliest ever in the Horn of Africa nation. The government has blamed the Somalia-based al-Shabab extremist group for what it calls a \"national disaster.\" Al-Shabab has not commented but often targets Mogadishu with bombings. 5:20pm A senator says the death toll from a massive truck bomb blast in Somalia's capital has risen to 231. Abshir Abdi Ahmed says 275 others were injured. He cites doctors at hospitals he has visited in Mogadishu. Saturday's blast is the single deadliest attack ever in the Horn of Africa nation. Many of the bodies in hospital mortuaries are yet to be identified. 3:05pm Local journalists say one freelance journalist was killed in Saturday's massive bombing in Somalia's capital and several were injured. Voice of America says one of its reporters, Abdulkaidr Mohamed Abdulle, is among the injured. Police and hospital sources say the death toll from the truck bomb in Mogadishu has risen to 189 in what is the single deadliest attack ever in the Horn of Africa nation. 2:35pm The death toll from a massive explosion in Somalia's capital has risen to 189 with over 200 others injured, police and hospital sources say, making it the single deadliest attack ever in the Horn of Africa nation. Doctors are struggling to assist hundreds of horrifically wounded victims, with many burnt beyond recognition. Somalia's government has blamed Saturday's truck bombing in Mogadishu on the al-Shabab extremist group, which has not commented. 1:25 pm The United States is joining the condemnation of Saturday's massive truck bombing in Somalia's capital that left scores dead. A statement by the US mission to Somalia says that \"such cowardly attacks reinvigorate the commitment of the United States to assist our Somali and African Union partners to combat the scourge of terrorism.\" The US military this year has stepped up drone strikes and other efforts this year against the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, which is based in Somalia and often targets Mogadishu. 1:20 pm The International Committee of the Red Cross says four volunteers with the Somali Red Crescent Society are among the dead after a huge truck bombing in Somalia's capital. A statement Sunday says \"this figure may rise as there are a number of volunteers still missing.\" Security and medical sources say at least 53 people are dead after what Mogadishu residents call the largest explosion they've ever witnessed. Officials have pleaded for blood donations. More than 60 people are injured. Somalia's government has blamed the al-Shabab extremist group, which has not commented. 10:45am Security and medical sources say the death toll from Saturday's truck bomb blast in Somalia's capital has risen to 53 as hospitals struggle to cope with the high number of casualties. More than 60 others are injured. Police Capt Mohamed Hussein says many victims died at hospitals from their wounds. Somalia's government has yet to release the exact death toll from an explosion many called the most powerful they had ever witnessed in Mogadishu. Ambulance sirens still echo across the city as bewildered families wander in the rubble of buildings. President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed has joined thousands of people who responded to a desperate plea by hospitals to donate blood for the wounded victims."

      "text": "In 2003, while getting ready for my PhD oral examination on English women writers of the British Raj, I read Sonia Amin's The World of Muslim Women in Colonial Bengal : 1876-1939. Amin wrote in her introduction that she had chosen 1876--the publication year of Rupjalal--to mark the beginning of women's history in colonial Bengal. My interest in Nawab Faizunnesa was instantly ignited. I tried to obtain a copy of Rupjalal during my visit to Bangladesh the next year, but found out in the process that finding a needle in the haystack would have been an easier task. I went to see Mansur Musa, the then DG of Bangla Academy, and asked him for the copy reprinted by the Academy in 1976. Something in my approach convinced the honorable DG (maybe my inexperience, or my eagerness, but I am not sure which of the two!) to ask his people to look for the book. Two weeks later, I was told that no copy had been located. I approached the DG again, this time, requesting permission to search for it myself. He then gave me access to the restricted rare books section.  Two staff members helped me as I dived into the piles of books, some of which had been manually catalogued, and some of which had been stored chaotically. After hours of searching, one of the gentlemen handed me a book with termite-bitten pages--Faizunnesa's Rupjalal! I asked the DG for one last favor: a photocopy of the book. He granted me that wish too. Till this day, I am grateful to Professor Musa for believing in me. I translated a few poems from the book and talked about them in my oral exam. My PhD committee members then asked me to translate the whole book. They wanted to read the book, they said, and expressed willingness to include it in their academic courses--on South Asian History, or Creative Writing, or Gender Studies, or Translation Studies--once published, of course. Rupjalal was published ultimately by Brill Publishers in 2008; most research libraries of the world obtained a copy of the book, and it  was made a part of their reading list for courses on South Asian Women's History or Literature. I have taught it myself in one of my Graduate courses in Gender Studies. The task of publishing, nay translating such a book, may seem like an easy one. But, in truth, the task of a translator is never that simple. For me the most powerful writing is the one that can convey a complicated thought or concept in the most plain and simple language. Writing, or translation for that matter, has the maximum impact when it touches the reader without much effort. After all, Language is a medium of expression, not a hindrance. I somewhat agree with Gayatri Spivak, who says that the translator's surrender to the rhetoricity of the original text and her ability to speak of intimate matters in the language of the original retains the \"literarity, textuality and sensuality of the writing,\" and  helps her embrace the Other through the intimacy of cultural translation (The Politics of Translation, 43). I believe that translation is a two-fold process.  A translator translates for the Other (the original writer), and for the others (the readers). And as a translator, she must let the Other be. Instead of imposing too much of herself on the otherness of the original writers, she should always invite them in--as if to possess her.     Rupjalal is narrated partly in poetry and partly in prose. Both the plot structure and the narrative technique are influenced by the Mangalkabya tradition. It frequently alludes to the Ramayana and the Mahabharata and exhibits a strong resemblance to The Arabian Nights. The poetry section follows the tradition of Bengali lyric poetry, which is then blended with the Muslim literary traditions of writing in mixed language.  Some verses are written in rhyming couplets (payar), some in four-lined rhyming verse (choupadi), and some, in three-lined verse (tripadi). The payar verses are end-rhymed while the tripadi verses are long couplets with two caesuras.   Working with a text with such a complicated narrative pattern is an exhilarating challenge for any translator.   I took the challenge to recreate the poetic form in English as closely as possible, without tarnishing the lexical sense of the original text. At times I translated every word, or every line; at times, when the imagery or the expression was too complicated, I had to use more words or lines than Faizunnesa originally used in her text.  My intent to analyse, historicize and translate was motivated by Faizunnesa's contribution to the field of women's writing in Bangladesh. Given the contemporary context, I also think that my translation may have saved Rupjalal from extinction.  After all, an English translation is more accessible and comprehensible than the original-- written in an archaic Bengali language-- dead, and almost forgotten.  But how can we forget our pioneers? How can we build a rich literary history of women's writing in Bangladesh if we forget to revive the foundation that was laid for us by our forerunners? I feel that I have been able to rectify history's neglect of Nawab Faizunnesa and hope that others will also take up projects to retrieve valuable texts written by women writers from disappearing from our shelves after termites had feasted on them .   The Ordeal of Rupbanu    1 4 The month of Sravan             pours monsoon rain Darkness envelops whole nature. The sky falls apart         and breaks my heart Like rain drops, I tremble in fear. At a time like this          where is he? Which Paths does he tread? And what hurdles Block his ways?!          I wish I could erase All the dangers that lie in his path. 2 Bhadra is a dangerous           month. Ferocious Tidal waves threaten rivers My heart falters   as it sees no hope. Tears Betray my eyes; what if he is Trying to return?  What if this rain Has caused a flood? How would he return? And what if             his boat or his ship Sinks in the deep ocean? My heart sinks              in sorrow. Fate brings Me nothing but loads of despair. My lover suffers                  in a remote place And for him, I suffer here.   Excerpt from Fayeza Hasanat's Nawab Faizunessa's Rupjalal Leiden: Brill, 2009. Fayeza teaches at the University of Central Florida, USA."

      "text": "Farmers, particularly cattle rearers, suffer from losses for death of animals from natural calamities like flood and cyclone in the absence of insurance coverage, analysts said yesterday. \"The prices of animals have increased significantly. Under the circumstances, the death of a cow causes huge losses to farmers,\" said Md Ainul Haque, director general of the Department of Livestock Services (DLS). Haque's comments came at a seminar styled 'cattle economy: problem and prospects', organised by the Bangladesh Agricultural Journalists and Activists Federation at the Press Institute of Bangladesh. The comment has become all the pertinent as the ongoing flood has wiped off livestock and damaged crops.  The DLS estimated that flood affected 1,234 farms and caused deaths of nearly 50,000 livestock, including poultry and cattle, in 113 upazilas, particularly up north. Haque said the government has decided in principle to introduce an insurance scheme for livestock under a World Bank-financed project. \"We are yet to fix the modalities but we want to introduce insurance benefits from July next year,\" he said. At the seminar, analysts said the potential for dairy development remains untapped in the absence of proper policy support and a lack of initiative from the policymakers. They suggested expediting the formation of a 'dairy development board', coming up with marketing facilities for milk, ensuring fair prices and extending credit and support.  \"One of the major constraints is marketing,\" Haque said. In the absence of adequate marketing facilities, farmers in rural areas do not get fair prices for the milk. \"Out of frustration about the low prices, farmers throw away milk on the street.\" Producers have to sell a litre of fresh milk at Tk 30 whereas the same is sold at Tk 80 in Dhaka, according to Haque. Discussants said dairy farming has increased in recent years leading to a spike in the production of milk and meat.  Yet, the country has to import milk and depend on smuggled cattle to meet a part of the demand for beef. Farmers' representatives at the event urged the government to discourage the entry of cattle from India and the import of powdered milk with a view to promoting domestic farming. \"The demand for milk and meat is rising because of an increase in income and population,\" said Jahangir Alam, an agricultural economist. Subsequently, he suggested low-cost credit schemes to promote cattle farming, expansion of artificial insemination and higher public and private investment in the livestock sector. The government should also provide reinsurance coverage to facilitate insurance in the sector, said Alam, also a former director general of the Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute. FH Ansarey, managing director and chief executive of ACI Agribusiness, said the government should frame clear and consistent policies to encourage private sector investment in dairy and beef production. The annual market size for beef is about Tk 15,000 crore and the sector needs Tk 10,000-12,000 crore of investment, he said. Md Anwarul Haque Beg, treasurer of Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University, said he heard about the formation of the 'dairy development board' in the 1980s. \"But it is yet to be established,\" he said, adding that neighbouring India has formed such a board 40 years ago. Beg also recommended bringing the 50 lakh small farmers under registration for providing extension and other support such as credit. Big investors will come forward if the influx of cattle from India is stopped, said Mohammad Imran Hossain, president of the Bangladesh Dairy Farmers Association. \"Beef will be produced on an industrial scale and the prices will come down.\" He also demanded the government charge the dairy farmers the same rates as the agriculture sector for electricity. At present, dairy farmers have to pay commercial rate on their electricity usage although dairy and livestock farming falls under agriculture. As a result, the cost of production goes up."

The theme is not surprising, given that people around the world have almost cut off connections with nature.  A balanced, inter-dependent coexistence of plants and animals creates grounds for the survival of human beings. But we have been degrading different components of the environment on various levels. In Bangladesh, the major areas of environmental degradation include land degradation (soil degradation, forest clearance, etc.), water pollution, loss of wetlands and biodiversity (species, genetic, habitat and ecosystem diversity), and sound and air pollution including change in the climatic variables (temperature, rainfall pattern, wind direction, etc.).  The annual report published by Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) indicated that during 2015-2016, about 2.9 million metric tonnes of chemical fertilisers (1.2 million metric tonnes from domestic production and 1.7 million metric tonnes imported) were distributed among the farmers of Bangladesh. The Environmental Compendium of Bangladesh 2009 suggests that in 2003-2004, the yearly use of chemical fertilisers was 3.3 million metric tonnes. These figures from two periods of time (2003-2004 and 2015-2016) suggest that on average about 3.1 million metric tonnes of chemical fertilisers are applied in the agricultural fields of the country (i.e. 31 million metric tonnes in 10 years). These huge amounts of chemical substances cause soil and water pollution when chemical fertiliser residues and remnants are discharged into nearby wetlands.  In addition, the country is losing about one percent of arable lands every year due to various reasons. Salinity intrusion in the coastal areas is seriously causing degradation of soil quality. Soil Resources Development Institute (SRDI 2010) estimates suggest that about 2.6 million acres (about 1.056 million ha, 27 percent of total coastal lands) of coastal lands are affected by various degrees of salinity. Forest degradation is also taking place in different parts of forest patches of the country. Current estimates (2012) provided by the Bangladesh Forest Department show that the areas of forests managed by the Department constitute of only 10.54 percent, of which 51.5 percent have no tree cover at all (see National Forest and Tree Resource Assessment [2005-2007] carried out by Bangladesh Forest Department with support of FAO) and another 20 percent have less than 10 percent of tree canopy cover. Therefore, it could be said that natural forests that have tree cover amount to less than five percent.  Water pollution and loss of wetlands and rivers are also taking place at an accelerating rate due to human-induced reasons. The impacts of these types of environmental degradation can be seen in the breakdown of ecosystem integrity, loss of habitats of different flora and fauna species and erosion in the genetic diversity of plants and animals. The Fifth National Report (2015) of the government submitted to Convention of Biological Diversity of the United Nations indicates that the total number of threatened species in Bangladesh is 486 (out of 3,813 which is 12.75 percent) as a result of degradation of ecosystems and habitats.  This brief account on Bangladesh's state of environment given above depicts a depressing picture, although some measures have been taken by state agencies like the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Department of Environment to curb further degradation of the environment. Thus it may lead one to ask why improvements in environment protection and management remain poor in Bangladesh when regulatory, institutional and budgetary frameworks and provisions are much stronger than before, media campaigns are more robust, and environmental education and awareness are more compelling. Understanding these challenges and overcoming them are crucial in making progress. The challenges can be divided into three categories. Firstly, the operational systems of environmental conservation and management aspects in Bangladesh are old-fashioned and ineffective. Secondly, inappropriate planning processes are causing serious environmental degradation. Lastly, knowledge gaps on environmental issues within the socio-economic and cultural context of Bangladesh are barriers for effective conservation measures.  Here are some of the issues that might be put under the first category: (i) the colonial and exploitative mindset of institutions and professionals still exists and this creates barriers for proper execution of existing rules and frameworks; (ii) ad-hoc, short-term planning and implementation of fragmented activities in relation to environmental management/conservation bring little success; sometimes they are counter-productive; (iii) political commitment for environmental conservation is poor.  The second category includes: (i) development planning; implementation of physical interventions especially if not properly harmonised with the characteristics of the land, i.e. the floodplain and deltaic plains; (ii) implementation of field level activities by different agencies is non-coordinated.  And finally, the third category includes the following: (i) inadequate research undertakings, weak assessment and monitoring systems which leave a vacuum in knowledge products; (ii) a comprehensive, national level environmental data depository (warehouse), which professionals, planners, community members can access to develop a plan of action, is still absent; (iii) conceptual clarity about the environment-poverty-disaster-climate change continuum is not studied and understood, leaving environmental concerns as a disconnected, stand-alone phenomenon. Environmental degradation in this region can be traced back as far as the colonial period which saw the expansion of rail networks, establishment of water navigation routes and use of land and forests for extraction of resources by British rulers. World famous Bengali scientist and applied statistician Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis had warned British rulers about the long-term consequences of rail lines by erecting embankments across the flood and delta plains. Historian SC Mitra in 1916 spoke about the waterlogging crisis in upper deltaic regions (in Jessore areas) and showed how irrigation canals and stagnated water caused malaria to spread in the region.  In later times, the water sector Master Plan developed by US-based engineering company IECO (1964) and subsequent establishment of embankments and polders in Bangladesh seriously affected the fluvial and hydrological systems of the floodplains and triggered different types of environmental degradation. Experts and institutions, including World Bank (International Bank of Reconstruction at that time), argued that the IECO report was not based on adequate data to properly understand the deltaic characteristics of the region, and therefore, the plan should not be implemented. The IECO Master Plan was for 20 years (1965 to 1985) but the Master Plan is still considered as the major guiding document for water resource management in Bangladesh. The warnings of the experts appear to be true as implementation of this Master Plan has caused waterlogging crisis, biodiversity loss, and the breakdown of livelihood pattern of millions of people.  Bangladesh inherited many environmental crises from historical periods and in recent times, the situation has only worsened. Given this context, strong commitment and will, an appropriate and informative plan, and proper monitoring of progress will help people and state agencies to improve the state of environment of Bangladesh. Strong environmental conditions are key to attaining the SDG targets, make communities more resilient to shocks and uncertainties and create a solid foundation of development.

      "text": "All trains to northern and south-western parts of the country for today were cancelled as a railway bridge was partly damaged in Kalihati upazila of Tangail due to floodwater. Director General of Bangladesh Railway Amjad Hossain told The Daily Star today. The DG has expressed his hope that the train service will resume by tomorrow morning. Full work force has been deployed but the repair is being been hampered due to strong current, said the DG, who has already left Dhaka for Tangail to visit the spot. Around 20 feet area of the basement of Pungli river rail bridge partly collapsed due to an onrush of floodwater some time after Sundarban Express, a Dhaka-bound inter-city train from Khulna, crossed the bridge around 5:00am, reports our Tangail correspondent visiting the spot. Meanwhile, a relief train from Joydebpur has already started the repair work while another train started from Pakshey of Pabna for Tangail to restore rail communication, said Bangladesh Railway West Zone Chief Engineer Ramjan Ali. The repair work was going on under the supervision of Deputy Commissioner of Tangail Khan Mohammad Nurul Amin and Superintendent of Police Mahbubul Alam. Talking to the correspondent, Railway Divisional General Manager (Pakshey zone) Washim Kumar Talukdar said he hoped that they would be able to restore the rail link by tomorrow morning temporally but it will take three days to resume full-fledged train service. Executive engineer of Water Development Board (WDB) of Tangail office Shahjahan Siraj blamed flood and sand lifting from the Pungli River for the incident. Meanwhile, the Dhaka bound-train 'Nilsagar express' coming from Nilphamari got stuck near the bridge following the damage of the railway bridge. The driver stopped the train near the bridge after local people gave danger signal flying red flag early morning, said local people. Following the railway bridge collapse, Dhaka-bound Rangpur Express got stuck at Bangabandhu Bridge East Railway Station while Dhaka-bound Ekota Express from Dinajpur at Bangabandhu Bridge West Railway Station and Rajshahi-bound Dhumketu Express from Dhaka at Joydebpur railway station, said Railway Divisional general manager (Pakshi zone) Washim Kumar Talukdar."

Mosammat Tarabanu, 45, was weeping for hours aftershe found that the flood inundated her crop, Sahid Mia, union parishad member of Perlarkandi, said. She suffered a cardiac arrest while weeping last night, he said. Tarabanu, with a family of five including a disabled husband, a son and two daughters, had cultivated two-and-half acres of land with loan from a local non-government organisation. The flash flood, caused by last month's intense rainfall, had damaged crops of most of the farmers in the north-eastern Bangladesh. When she visited the piece of land in the haor yesterday, she found out that all her crop was washed away, Abdul Hamid, Tarabanu's neighbour, said. \"She could not take the shock,\" he said. Tofazzal Sohel, general secretary of Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon, Habiganj unit, siad: \"I visited most of the Haor under Habiganj. I seen farmers face unexpected loss.\" Boro crop has been inundated due to rise in water level in Habiganj especially in Baniarchang Upazila's Haor, he said. He said he never saw this much rain in Chaitra (the month of Bangla year-end). \"The death of Tarabanu is extremely tragic. People all over the Haor region are wailing over the loss,\" he said. \"Pahela Baishakh will not bring any smile to their faces.\""

      "text": "Low-cost housing would be the next big thing for the real estate sector. Bangladesh House Building Finance Corporation (BHBFC) would give priority to home loan applicants who opt for low-cost technology. One such technology makes use of hollow bricks of uniform shape and size instead of the conventional ones. The bricks require a very low amount of plaster, which helps cut construction costs to a great extent. Debasish Chakrabarty, managing director of the state-owned housing finance provider, shared the concept and the organisation's future plans with The Daily Star recently. It takes 21 to 28 days to complete a roof in the conventional method while only 5 days if the hollow bricks are used, he said. \"We are promoting the low-cost housing technology, which has the ability to save houses from fire, flood and earthquake.\" India uses the technology there. Kenya and Tanzania are also using the method that is called \"Koto\" in Malaysia, he said. \"We have also discussed the benefits of using the technology with the leaders of the Real Estate and Housing Association of Bangladesh. \"In future, we want to form a subsidiary and develop the product on our own.\" The housing finance organisation was launched in 1952. The corporation has so far given loans for constructing 2 lakh housing units. The BHBFC made a profit of Tk 166 crore in the last fiscal year. \"We paid 42.5 percent of the amount or Tk 86 crore as tax in advance to the government. It has never counted any loss since its inception\". The organisation received Tk 110 crore as capital from the government by 1992 and afterwards it met its needs by selling government guaranteed debentures worth Tk 1,864 crore to different banks. The current balance of debentures stands at Tk 365 crore. In addition to this, the organisation received Tk 350 crore from the government as loan at a rate of 3 percent and hopes to get another Tk 150 crore by this year. BHBFC is the only state organisation that gets funds from the government as loans. The BHBFC will get another loan of Tk 865 crore from the Islamic Development Bank. The amount will come on condition that it has to be distributed in areas outside of Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet metropolitan areas in the next two years, he said. \"The IDB loan will be a huge boost to the organisation. So I have taken several steps and re-arranged the loan products.\" The BHBFC has launched Nagar Bandhu, a loan product for the people living in Dhaka and Chittagong. Palli Maa is another product that will cover the rest of the country, he said. The home-loan provider has 29 branches now and plans to open 71 more soon, he said. The organisation had been enjoying monopoly in giving loans since its inception before the launch of Delta Brac Housing in 1996 and National Housing Corporation in 1999, he said. \"The market share we have is not satisfactory at all.\" Specialised housing finance firms like BHBFC have 12 percent market share, according to Bangladesh Bank. Private banks have 55 percent market share while state banks have 21 percent, foreign banks 4 percent and non-banks 8 percent. In rural areas, private banks have a very low market share and BHBFC is the leader there.  \"Almost 63 percent of our loans were distributed in rural areas in the last fiscal year. The amount will increase when we will start distributing IDB loans.\" \"We have already lowered our rates. The interest rate for building construction is now 9.5 percent, for flats it is 10 percent and 8.5 percent for rural areas outside of the Dhaka metropolitan area.\" \"Our ceiling was as low as Tk 50 lakh. We have increased the ceiling to Tk 1 crore for building construction and for flat to Tk 80 lakh. My competitors such as private banks have a ceiling of Tk 1.2 crore.\" One loan product of BHBFC that has created a stir is for expatriates called Probash Bandhu. \"Bangladeshi expatriates with three years' work experience can now visit our website, fill up the form and apply online for the loan.\" \"We have earlier allowed expatriates only of five countries. But due to its huge demand, we have withdrawn the bar. Now people from any country can apply for it.\" The Probash Bandhu has left a very good impact on the housing loan sector. Private banks have also started offering loans to expatriates. \"We wanted to do something like that and wanted others to follow us.\" The nominated local representatives of the expatriates can contact the corporation and complete the procedure to receive the loan. The expatriates will be given the opportunity to clear the loan in 25 years, the highest among all products of BHBFC, he said. The organisation lags behind its competitors in the field of technology and automation. \"The quality of service of BHBFC is still lower than that of private banks. We are working on it.\" \"We are planning to launch an e-filing system. All information of the loan applications will be available in the e-filing system, which will definitely decrease corruption in BHBFC.\" People will be able to know the condition of their application and place their complaints online, he said. \"The implementation of the system needs huge investment as we will need to set up computers on each desk. But we do not have the right to purchase a computer by ourselves. We need to take permission of the ministry to do such purchases also.\" The corporation does not have any data centre. \"We will soon float tender to establish a centralised data-based centre.\" \"The organisation does not do its banking related work such as collections of loans by itself, whereas in India and Malaysia organisations like us do these things by themselves.\" \"Our customers have to stand in long lines in state-owned banks and face harassment to clear their monthly payments of housing loans. To ease the pressure, we have already signed a deal with Standard Chartered Bank.\" \"The monthly payments of the clients will be sent online to our accounts directly from the customers' accounts under the direct debit system. The whole system will not cost anything for the customers, banks and BHBFC.\" \"We also cannot recruit directly. We have to apply for new manpower. We can only give requisitions. We have only 455 people whereas we should have 795.\" The organisation will organise a three-day housing and finance fair on October 19 at the Sonargaon hotel in Dhaka. Different private banks and real estate companies are scheduled to take part in the fair. The BHBFC's outstanding loan is decreasing and it reached Tk 3,000 crore while the default loan rate now stands at 6 percent, he said. \"To increase the outstanding loan amount, we have to increase the loan disbursement target. We have achieved last year's loan sanction target of Tk 350 crore.\" \"We have sanctioned Tk 353 crore last year. Whereas our loan disbursement target was Tk 272 crore and we disbursed Tk 278 crore.\" Now it targets to disburse Tk 400 crore in the next fiscal year and increase the amount to Tk 700 crore to lower the cost of funds, which now stands at around 8 percent, he said. \"We have upgraded the condition of the office of BHBFC, as we believe that the office environment determines the service quality.\" \"The organisation wants to showcase the latest available technologies of the sector through the October housing fair and through its head office.\" \"We have urged the businesses to turn one of the floors of BHBFC into 3D floors so that visitors feel encouraged to use it in their houses.\" The corporation also reorganised its loan product for farmers. \"There was no such loan for the farmers in Bangladesh. We are forming the structure of the loan. The low-cost housing will be used here.\" Anyone with farm land can also apply for the loan. People can also take loans to build guest houses in their village homes, he said. \"We share all these information on our Facebook page. People can place their queries there and we respond to them through the social media platform as soon as possible.\"   shoyeb513@gmail.com"

      "authors": "\nStaff Correspondent\t\n",
      "text": "With rice prices soaring across the country, the government yesterday made a rather delayed intervention in the form of selling the staple at a subsidised price under a nationwide Open Market Sale programme. Engaging nearly a thousand dealers, the food ministry channelled OMS rice for Tk 30 a kg to people lining up at designated sale points. Though the price of OMS rice has doubled this time to Tk 30 from Tk 15 a kg, it is still lower by at least Tk 20 a kg from yesterday's retail market price. The state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) said the coarse varieties of rice were on sale in the capital's retail markets for Tk 50 to 54 a kg yesterday, Tk 10 higher than that only a month ago. The government would also launch its Food-Friendly Programme tomorrow under which 1.5 lakh tonnes of rice would be sold to five million ultra-poor for only Tk 10 a kg. They can buy 30 kg of rice each. Besides, the government directed the local administrations in major rice-trade zones to strengthen monitoring to prevent hoarding of rice. \n Food ministry sources told The Daily Star that such interventions could not be made earlier because of very low stock of rice in public granaries. A section of rice millers allegedly hoarded rice and deliberately hiked prices after the country lost crops -- primarily estimated at 20 lakh tonnes -- to flashfloods in Haor areas and fungal attack in the last Boro season. Government stock of rice rose to 3.4 lakh tonnes yesterday, thanks to some late imports from Vietnam. Another 1.2 lakh tonnes are on the way to Chittagong Port. Meanwhile, a Myanmar delegation arrived in Dhaka yesterday for fixing modalities for Bangladesh's import of up to three lakh tonnes of rice.    On the first day of OMS operation yesterday, people found it difficult to locate the points of sales due to lack of publicity by the government. Md Rubel Ahmed, an OMS dealer, told this newspaper that each of them got one tonne of rice and one tonne of coarse flour for daily sale. The prices are fixed at Tk 30 for rice and Tk 17 a kg for coarse flour. A consumer can buy up to five kg of each item. Asked, Waziur Rahman, deputy director of food, said, \"The OMS programme, meant for providing rice to common people at relatively low prices, started across the country in the morning.\" A total of 806 OMS centres, including 179 in flood-affected areas, would sell rice across the country, mentioned the deputy director. Another food official said 109 OMS centres are in operation in the capital. However, our district correspondents reported that lack of publicity affected OMS operation in many parts of the country on the first day of OMS sale yesterday. The OMS rice sale failed to draw attention of buyers in the city due to absence of publicity. M Moniruzzaman, Rajshahi regional controller of food, said the OMS operation began fully in Rajshahi city, Naogaon and Bogra, and partially in Joypurhat, Pabna and Natore. He said the dealers in Rajshahi city began the sale in the afternoon, as it took them time to deposit money with banks and collect rice from government warehouses. Kaisar Ali, food controller in Dinajpur, said the OMS rice sale began in Dinajpur and his office engaged 24 dealers in the task. Split in four groups, the dealers would sell six tonnes of rice every day. The Daily Star correspondent in Dinajpur, however, didn't find any OMS outlet in Barabandar, Bahadurbazar, Gudribazar and Chehelgazi areas of the town. Mohammad Tareque, who was in charge of a truck carrying OMS items in city's Mugda, said they would operate from 9:00am to 5:00pm every day. Tareque said the number of customers was less yesterday as many people were yet to know about the OMS sale. Tofayel Alam, a class-IV employee of Geological Survey of Bangladesh, went there to buy coarse flour along with his wife. The couple bought 10 kg coarse flour from the OMS Truck. \"We are happy that we got it... This is enough to meet our need for a month,\" Tofayel said, adding that he had earlier bought flour for Tk 30 a kg from a shop. Kabir Hossain, driver of a CNG-run three-wheeler in Dholaipar area, said he bought rice and flour from an OMS sale point for the first time as the price of coarse rice shot up to Tk 52 a kg in retail shops. Abdul Awal Talukdar, owner of Mukta Rice Agency in Karwan Bazar, said the price of rice of various categories increased after the Eid. He blamed a \"syndicate\" of millers for the price hike. Yesterday afternoon, a large group of law enforcers led by Kushtia Additional Deputy Commissioner Habibur Rahman inspected Khwajanagar, one of the country's biggest rice milling and trade zone, to make sure that no trader can hoard rice. Later, the ADC told the media that they carried out the inspection in the presence of millers and traders to ensure that rice is traded and supplied normally to all other parts of the country from Khwajanagar. The move came just six days after another government team raided mills and warehouses owned by Bangladesh Rice Millers Association President Abdur Rashid in Kushtia and slapped a fine of Tk 50,000 for hoarding. Rashid yesterday claimed that he owns one of the country's largest rice mills, and several thousand tonnes of paddy and rice have to be kept in warehouse in any given season to keep the mill operational. Bangladesh imported around seven lakh tonnes of rice in over two and a half months of the current fiscal year against only 1.33 lakh tonnes in the last fiscal year. Five lakh tonnes out of the seven lakh came through private importers. Chitta Majumder, a rice importer, told this newspaper that imports from India got cheaper after duty cut by Bangladesh government. But the prices increased again after the Eid-ul-Azha as Indian exporters hiked prices to Tk 41-42 from Tk 37 a kg.  He said traders across the border increased the prices amid growing demand from Bangladeshi importers. Besides, there were delays in shipments for a few days before and after the Eid due to shortage of transport. Recent rumours over India's slapping a ban on rice export also fuelled the price, Chitta added."

      "text": "It was December 25 morning Nazu Akther, 30, a garment worker, was waiting to cross the busy Mailer Matha road in Saltgola area of Chittagong city to get on a bus to go to her workplace. Seeing the road quite free, she started crossing it keeping her eyes on the right side in case vehicles come along. But she was not ready for the three-wheeler coming from the opposite direction. The vehicle knocked her down resulting in a lifelong disability. She got her left leg run over by a trailer coming from the right side and within a week, the leg had to be severed while she was undergoing treatment at a hospital. The incident which occurred over two months ago left Nazu, a resident of Saltgola area, with no work. The mother of three now can barely make ends meet with her day-labourer husband. On June 10, 2015, another wrong-side driving accident killed a garment worker and injured two others in the area. The accident occurred when a covered van hit a three-wheeler which was plying the wrong side of the road. The victims were passengers of the three-wheeler. Apart form these two, minor incidents occur every day as nearly a hundred three-wheelers ply the wrong direction from Saltgola to EPZ road in the area from 6:00am to 8:00am. During these two hours, thousands of garment workers head out to their workplace in Chittagong Export Processing Zone (CEPZ) and Karnaphuli Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) by bus and other vehicles. As the workers wait across the right side of the road for vehicles to get on, the road gets crowded creating a gridlock for several hours. As a result, medium-sized vehicles like tempos choose to ply the wrong side of the road to ferry passengers mainly from Saltgola to EPZ intersection. The Daily Star on June 20, 2015 published a report about the rampant wrong-side driving in the area. No actions have been taken against the violators of rules yet. Visiting the area from 6:00am to 8:00am recently, this correspondent witnessed several three-wheelers and fast-moving vehicles like bus and trailer moving freely on the wrong side. Many garment workers were also seen crossing the road with vehicles moving fast on both sides of the road. Alamgir, a resident of Agrabad area and worker of a garment factory, said they have to be very cautious while crossing the road as oftentimes three-wheelers, running on the wrong side of the road may hit them. \"Small accidents occur daily on the road. These violations are only noticed when someone loses his or her life or limb,\" said Alamgir. Talking to several drivers, it was found that the three-wheelers usually run on Barik Building-Chawkbazar route. As the number of passengers is high in the morning in EPZ area, the three-wheelers flood the area. They said police do not harass them for driving on the wrong side of the road. Assistant Commissioner of Chittagong Metropolitan Police (CMP) (port) Mosharraf Hossain said traffic police are deployed in the city from 7:00am.  But they were not aware of the rules violations. Now that they are informed they will take action against vehicles that ply on the wrong side of the road. Biplab Kumar Paul, Traffic Inspector (EPZ zone) of Chittagong Metropolitan area, said from March 1, he has impounded around 50 vehicles mostly three-wheelers, in this area for running on the wrong side of the road. It is not possible for police alone to control the vehicles in the morning as thousands of garment workers and hundreds of vehicles pass through the road during that time, he said. \"Along with legal actions, special programmes should be taken to make drivers aware of the consequences of driving in the wrong direction\", said Biplab. He, however, said there is no data on accidents that took place in the area."

      "text": "It has been seven long years since water resources ministers of Bangladesh and India last met to talk about Teesta at the platform of Joint Rivers Commission (JRC). Since then Bangladesh has been more than ready about holding a meeting of the JRC, an official instrument devised jointly by Bangladesh and India back in 1972, to resolve water disputes and harness common water resources for mutual and regional benefits. A long overdue JRC meeting in Dhaka in June 2013 was postponed due to India's last moment pullout. Nearly four more years passed by and Dhaka wrote to Delhi dozens of times seeking a date to hold the JRC meeting but to no avail. As far as water sharing issue of river Teesta is concerned things actually had moved fast after the 37th JRC meeting (the last one) held in Delhi back in early 2010. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to India in January that year helped put JRC back into motion so much so that a water treaty on the sharing of Teesta was about to be struck the very following year as then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh came to Dhaka on a return visit. The Teesta deal had faced obstacles since September 2011 when West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, scheduled to visit Dhaka with Singh, opted out of the trip, opposing the agreement. Originating in India's Sikkim, Teesta enters into Bangladesh through West Bengal. Mamata has been opposing the water deal based on the argument that if India commits to certain cusecs of guaranteed water share from Teesta to Bangladesh, her state might be deprived of water during the dry season. In a subsequent development, Mamata commissioned an expert, Kalyan Rudra, to give a report on Teesta water sharing prospects. The Rudra report, submitted in 2012, has never been made public but Indian media reported on several instances that the report had stated that there was a shortage of water in Teesta since the Indian government had been building hydro-power projects upstream. In fact it's not only in Sikkim, rather the Teesta water diversion was made also in West Bengal through building of a dam and hydro-power project in Gajaldoba near Shiliguri. India completed the Gajaldoba project at a time when Bangladesh had to abandon its planned 2nd phase of Teesta Barrage irrigation project as the very command area of the 1st phase dried up due to very poor flow of water through the Teesta.      Since the 2011 momentum evaporated there has been a long lull over the prospect of a Teesta water sharing agreement between the lower-riparian Bangladesh and its upper-riparian neighbour, India. Bangladesh and India, which share between them waters of 54 common rivers, inherit and cherish a long tradition of using and harnessing of this natural resource amicably and judiciously. The signing of the Ganges water sharing agreement by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her then Indian counterpart Deve Gowda in December, 1996 is one example of a mutually agreed solution to water sharing between neighbours. The 30-year water-sharing arrangement recognised Bangladesh's rights on Ganges water as a lower riparian country.  According to the JRC website, there are as many as 405 big and small rivers in Bangladesh, of which 57 are transboundary. Of these 57, Bangladesh and Myanmar are co-riparian for only three rivers. Given the fact that Bangladesh and India are co-riparian countries having a common stake on as many as 54 transboundary rivers, it was prudent and visionary on the part of the leadership of a new nation (Bangladesh) back in March 1972 to embark upon a crucial instrument called Joint Rivers Commission (JRC). The Indo-Bangla JRC was established on a permanent basis through a joint declaration on March 19, 1972 inter alia to carry out a comprehensive survey of the river systems shared by the two countries; formulate and implement projects concerning flood control in both countries; formulate detailed proposals on advance flood warnings, flood forecasting, study on flood control and irrigation projects on the major river systems; and examine the feasibility of linking the power grids of Bangladesh with the adjoining areas of India, so that the water resources of the regions can be utilised on an equitable basis for mutual benefit of the people of the two countries.  Since its inception the JRC had 37 meetings till 2010, which discussed, among other things, sharing waters of common rivers, transmission of flood related data from India to Bangladesh,  construction and repair of embankment and bank protection works along common/border rivers,  Indian River Inter Linking project, Tipaimukh Dam project of India and Mahananda Barrage constructed by India.  Though there has been no meeting of JRC (at the Water Ministerial level) in the last seven years, there were several other meetings that took place either in India or in Bangladesh on and off at technical levels. But ever since the talks were stalled in 2011, there has been no significant call for materialising the Teesta river treaty by New Delhi. Expectations run high every time there is a summit and during high official-level visits between Bangladesh and India. But experts in the water discourse always emphasise on activating JRC as a forum where both political and technical discussions can take place simultaneously. It's not crucial just because Bangladesh wants its due share of water from the river Teesta. Rather, it's necessary for the best interests of both Bangladesh and India. It's not only about Teesta, it's more than that. Teesta apart, progress on discussions on sharing of the waters of Feni, Monu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gumti, Dharala and Dudhkumar rivers has also been stalled for long. Bangladesh's concern over India's river interlinking project is far from over as the project works continue to gain momentum. India is also curious to know, in further details, whether or not the Ganges Barrage that Bangladesh contemplates to build in Rajbari would have any negative bearings in its ecology. So there is a whole range of issues here that demand attention.   The writer is Assignment Editor at The Daily Star."

      "text": "The flood situation has improved across the country as the water level of the major rivers in the northern and central districts have significantly dropped.   According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), all the major rivers are in falling trend, but the Ganges is in the rising trend and it is flowing below the danger level. Water level in the Brahmaputra-Jamuna is receding at most places, meaning water level in the rivers will be normal within the next four or five days, Executive Engineer of FFWC Md Sazzad Hossain said. Among the 90 monitored water level stations, 27 river stations are flowing above danger level, a bulletin issued by the FFWC said today. The Ghagot at Gaibandha, the Karatoa at Chak Rahimpur, the Jamuna at  Bahadurabad, Sariakandi, Kazipur, Sirajganj and Aricha, the Gur at Singra,  the Atrai at Baghabari, the Dhaleswari at Elasin and Jagir, the Lakhya at Lakhpur, the Kaliganga at Taraghat, the Mohananda at Chapainawabganj, the Little Jamuna at Naogaon, the Padma at Goalundo, Bhagyakul, Sureswar, and Kaniaghat the Surma at Kanaighat, the Kushiyara at Amalshid, Sheola, Sherpur-Sylhet, the old Surma at Derai, the Kangsha at Jariajanjail and the Titas at Brahmanbaria are flowing above danger level 4cm, 11cm, 59cm, 90cm, 97cm,60cm, 84cm, 100cm, 98cm, 65cm, 7cm, 95cm, 48cm, 36cm, 41cm, 33cm, 46cm, 10cm, 48cm, 83cm and 42cm respectively. The overall flood situation may improve significantly in the country within a few days as the trend of less rainfall is seen in Bangladesh and upstream regions of India, Sazzad said. According to FFWC, the Brahmaputra in the north was receding, but waters in the Ganges, covering the northwest are still being inflated. Though water levels in some of the major rivers in the northern and central districts - Brahmaputra Teesta, Dharla and Jamuna -- continue to recede, several lakh people are still suffering from the devastating flood, officials and local people told BSS. The flood situation in the Karatoa river basin areas under Gobindaganj and Palashbari upazilas of Gaibandha district and some area of Naogaon district remained unchanged as water level of the river was steady. Department of Disaster Management officials said 900 unions of 138 upazilas in 25 districts have so far been inundated by floodwater. The number of flood-affected families is over 9 lakh. The flood situation improved in Rangpur division with continuous fall in water levels of the major rivers in the northern districts on the Brahmaputra basin. The situation is getting normal gradually in Panchagarh, Thakurgaon, Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Dinajpur and Kurigram. Most of the displaced people have started returning homes. Relief activities have also been beefed up in the flood-hit areas of the districts. A total of 1,627 medical teams in 27 districts across the country are working to provide emergency medical services to flood-affected people."

      "text": "One of the pillars of Sustainable Development Strategy (2016-2030), a universal development agenda of the UN, is addressing climate change issues in the course of the socio-economic development process. Of the 17 thematic goals, 13, 14 and 15 (climate action, life below water, life on land) pertain to addressing climate change impact issues which are facilitating goals to attain other transformative goals. Without addressing these climate-related issues any development effort may turn futile. Addressing these goals relates to the sustainable use of natural resources which include water, forests, land and soil, coastal and marine ecology, and energy resources management. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have covered the issue of sustainable natural resources adequately and in this context we can review Bangladesh's standing. Sustainable development denotes, \"meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,\" (Our Common Future, The Brundtland Commission, United Nations, 1987). Sustainable development (SD) is a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs while preserving the environment so that these needs can be met not only in the present, but also for generations to come. The following are some of the major priorities that need to be addressed in Bangladesh urgently: 1. Properly following the environmental sustainability, conservation and efficient use of natural resources which are important cross-cutting elements in the Seventh Five Year Plan, National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS) and to-be-prepared Bangladesh Delta Plan (BDP) 2100. 2. Enhancing environmental governance through greater enforcement of existing laws, with active citizen participation, financial incentives and capacity building of different ministries with emphasis on local governments. 3. Promoting sustainable consumption as a key citizen responsibility through education, learning and cultural traits. 4. Greater engagement of the private sector in sustainable production and efficient resource utilisation through research and innovation of technology, and learning from the experience of other countries. 5. Increasing clean energy, clean development mechanisms and green growth strategies. The Bangladesh government has already taken actions in the following areas: (i) air pollution management and improving urban health; (ii) forests and resilient rural development; (iii) regional cooperation on shared ecological resources; (iv) blue economy development; and (v) large scale afforestation. Sustainable development is a constitutional obligation in Bangladesh: \"The state shall endeavor to protect and improve the environment and to preserve and safeguard the natural resources, biodiversity, wetlands, forests and wildlife for the present and future citizens.\" [Article 18A of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh] In pursuant of the outline agreed in the Rio+20 declarations, the NSDS (2010-2021) for Bangladesh has been finalised in 2013 by the Planning Commission. NSDS Framework: The green economy is not the end, but is a means of achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication through integrated economic, social and environmental development. Bangladesh also formulated relevant policies and strategies: Environment Policy and Implementation Plan (1992); National Forestry Policy (1994); National Fish Policy (1998); National Policy for Safe Water Supply and Sanitation (1998); National Rural Development Policy (2001); The National Policy for the Advancement of Women (1998); National Water Policy (1999); National Agricultural Policy (1999); National Land Use Policy (2001); Draft Coastal Zone Policy (2004) etc. Water resources \nWater use in the country is heavily dependent on its groundwater resources. In 2010-11, 67 percent of the total irrigated area of 7.45 million hectares was irrigated for groundwater. For its nearly 12.5 million city dwellers, Dhaka WASA (Water Supply & Sewerage Authority) produces 2,110 million litres of water per day, 87.72 percent of which comes from underground while the rest comes from the surface. The groundwater system is under severe threat because of arsenic in groundwater, salinity in the shallow aquifers in the coastal areas and lowering of groundwater level due to unsustainable abstraction. Rivers are the lifelines of Bangladesh. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to keep those healthy and flowing. Unfortunately, there have been developments in the past which are causing problems in sustaining the river system. Such developments include some water development projects, upstream diversion of water and pollution of river water due to industrialisation and urbanisation.  Currently, there are about 500 water development and flood control projects in the country, covering about 40 percent of the country. While these water development and flood control projects have contributed to ensuring the country's food security, there have been serious negative impacts on wetlands, fisheries and the ecosystems of some parts of the country. Different components of the riverine ecosystem such as rivers, wetlands and floodplains have become delinked from each other by these projects along with the roads. As a result, most of the services of floodplain ecosystem have been lost. Bangladesh shares 57 rivers with its upstream neighbours. The upstream water withdrawal in many cases is causing damage to the downstream riverine ecosystems. The increasing urbanisation and industrialisation in Bangladesh has negative implications for water quality. The pollution from industrial and urban waste effluents and agro-chemicals in some water bodies and rivers has reached alarming levels. The long-term effects of this water contamination by organic and inorganic substances, many of them toxic, are incalculable.  Preparation of a long-term holistic and integrated plan like Bangladesh Delta Plan focusing on water and natural resources has been initiated. Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 is under preparation now and is to be finalised this year. Forests and biodiversity\nForestry is one of the most important components of environment balancing the ecosystem. However, its economic value is far exceeded by its environmental importance/significance.  The forestry sub-sector presently accounts for 2.93 percent of the GDP with annual growth rate of about 5 percent. Official record of forest area is 2.5 million hectares or 17 percent of the total land area of the country, but practically it is far less because of low tree density in forest lands. The forest area has declined due to clearing of forest land for cultivation, shrimp farming, industry, and settlements. However, the social/homestead and community forestry has significantly grown due to vigorous public sector campaign for plantation. Forests in Bangladesh are home to many species of indigenous trees, plants, insects, birds and animals, some of them are now rare. Almost 80 percent of terrestrial biodiversity finds refuge in forests. Thus the forests also provide a much needed habitat for endangered species. However, in Bangladesh, forests are unfortunately being overexploited to the point of making them unsustainable. Forests in the Chittagong Hill Tracts have been especially depleted contributing to massive loss of biodiversity, making some species extinct and putting many on the endangered list.  Bangladesh is a transitional zone of flora and fauna, because of its geographical settings and climatic characteristics. There are many rivers and streams in the country covering a total length of 22,155 km. About 11 percent of the country's area belongs to different types of water bodies. In addition to the regular inland waters, seasonally a large part of the country remains submerged for 3-4 months during monsoon. Haor basin in the northeast region of the country is such an important wetland. The wetland system is a vast repository of biodiversity. The wetland ecosystems have been suffering due to chemical runoff from agricultural practices which contain the fertilizer, pesticides, residues, and overexploitation. The Government of Bangladesh in 1999 declared 8 areas of Cox's Bazar and Teknaf Peninsula, St. Martin's Island, Sonadia Island, Hakaluki Haor, Tanguar Haor and Marjat Baor, the Gulshan-Baridhara Lake and 10 km landward periphery of Sundarbans as Ecologically Critical Areas (ECAs). Later in 2009, 4 rivers around Dhaka city (Buriganga, Sitalakhya, Balu and Turag) were declared as ECAs. The GEF/UNDP assisted project titled Coastal and Wetland Biodiversity Management Project (CWBMP) at Cox's Bazar and Hakaluki Haor which is being implemented by the Department of Environment, has been undertaking various programmes towards conservation of the biological diversities of four ECAs. The aim is to ensure conservation, management and sustainable use of biological and other resources of the ECAs through establishing institutional arrangements. There are 34 Protected Areas (PA) in Bangladesh, of which 17 are National Parks and 17 Wildlife Sanctuaries. The total area of PA is 265,403 hectares which is 10.51 percent of the total forest areas of the country. All the protected areas are notified under the Bangladesh Wildlife Order 1973. The biggest PA in Bangladesh is the Sundarbans (a World Heritage Site) and the smallest PA is the Ramsagar National Park. There are 4 marine PA, of which 3 are wildlife sanctuaries situated in Sundarbans and one is Nijhum Dweep National Park situated in the mangrove forests in Noakhali. Biological zoning approach has been adopted in PA to ensure the protection of wildlife species and floral habitats. Land use\nLand use in the country is diverse and often conflicting: it is intensively used for agriculture, settlements, forestry, shrimps, ghers, natural fisheries, salt production, industrial and infrastructural development and tourism. All these have resulted into the  following features: demand for expansion in all land uses (urban area, settlement, roads/highways, etc.); increasing demands for new uses (tourism, export processing zones and others); encroachment and conversion of land from one use to the other, e.g. crop agriculture to aquaculture, cropland to woods. Present per capita agricultural land of 0.05 hectares will decrease to 0.025 hectares by 2050. Without effective measures to arrest this alarming trend the land available for crop production will continue to fall. Degradation of land refers to loss of its potential production capability as a result of degradation of soil quality and also its loss for effective use. Estimates by Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC) indicate that soil related problems may be a major constraint on agricultural growth. Declining soil fertility, soil erosion, and salinisation affect 5.6-8.7 million hectares, 5.3 hectares, and 3.05 million hectares of land respectively. Soil erosion, being irreversible, is generally regarded as the most serious problem of soil degradation. The exploitation of groundwater for irrigation for dry season rice farming (boro) has reached beyond capacity of annual recharge of aquifers, with adverse effects on the supply of safe drinking water. The irrigated area has expanded to over 5.5 million hectares out of 8.0 million hectares of cultivated land, and over three-fourths of the area is irrigated with groundwater, mostly by privately installed shallow tube wells. The arsenic contamination of drinking water in large parts of the country is often blamed on overexploitation of groundwater for irrigation with shallow tube wells. The process of desertification is defined by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, 1994, as \"land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas resulting from various factors, including climate variation and human activities\". Coastal and marine resources\nThe coastal zone contains several ecosystems that have important conservation values: mangrove, marine, estuary, islands, coral, sandy beaches, sand dunes. The world's largest uninterrupted stretch of mangrove ecosystem, the Sundarbans, has been declared a World Heritage Site in 1997, whereas coral ecosystems are found around St. Martin's Island. These ecosystems are not only biodiversity hotspots, but also provide the ecological foundation for an important common access resource: the fisheries in the Bay of Bengal. The government has already declared several ECAs in the coast. Many sanctuaries have also been created. The most recent example is declaration of three sanctuaries for dolphins in the Sundarbans. Recently, Bangladesh won a landmark verdict at the International Tribunal on Law of the Sea, which sustained its claims to 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic and territorial rights in the Bay of Bengal. The verdict of the tribunal gave Bangladesh a substantial share of the outer continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, which would open up possibilities for peacefully exploiting immense resources (gas, oil, fish, etc.). The tribunal also awarded Bangladesh a full 12-nautical mile territorial sea around St. Martin's Island, overruling Myanmar's argument that it should be cut in half.  One of the earliest interventions in the coast, since 1968, was the Coastal Embankment Project (CEP). The Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) constructed a series of polders. CEP was instrumental in enhancing productive potential of coastal land by protecting it from saline intrusion. Polders are now a natural feature of the coastal hydro-morphological setting. Sea dikes are considered as the first line of defense against the impacts of sea level rise. One unintended effect of CEP, however, has been sedimentation of the rivers resulting in severe waterlogging in the southern part of Khulna and Bagerhat districts. Tidal River Management adopted in Khulna-Jessore area shows a promising sustainable option. Rivers and canals need regular dredging in these areas. Over the years, uncoordinated development activities have led to the depletion of natural resources like fish and forests and overall degradation of the natural environment. These activities have also sometimes created conditions of scarcity for the poor and the disadvantaged by different kinds of social, economic, technical or institutional barriers which limit access to common property resources on which they are dependent for their livelihood. Use of fish resources\nBangladesh is among the world's leading inland fisheries producers with an annual production of more than 2.8 million tonnes. The government also has successfully embarked on a major sustainable effort to safeguard the national Hilsa fish. However, almost 30 percent of all inland fish species are threatened with extinction. There is a mounting concern that nine critically endangered species of inland fisheries are in danger of collapse, which would threaten livelihoods and diets, especially among the poorest.  While Bangladesh has strong environmental and natural resource management policies and regulations, there remains a need for integrating environmental protection and management into national planning and strengthening environmental institutions, especially to respond to rapid urbanisation, industrialisation, and growing pollution. To unlock the potential of the climate-smart \"blue\" economy, Bangladesh needs to improve its protection of ocean health, create sustained jobs and livelihoods, strengthen its management of vast marine resources and promote climate-resilient forest and landscape management, which can improve livelihoods and foster economic opportunities in rural areas helping attain SDGs 1 and 2 in addition to addressing goal 14 directly. Renewable energy\nThe government had earlier prepared a Power System Master Plan (PSMP) 2010 to improve and expand electricity supply to support GDP growth in the 7-8 percent range. At present, PSMP 2015 is being prepared. To meet the demand with reasonable reliability, installed power generation capacity needs to be increased to 24,000 MW and 39,000 MW by 2021 and 2030 respectively. The Renewable Energy Policy obligates the renewable energy share to be 10 percent by 2020 (2,000 MW). To meet this target, the government has prepared a year-wise plan, which is a bit above the range of the policy target. Gradually, tapping renewable energies has to be emphasised to attain SDG 7.

      "text": "Mustafa ZamanAugust 11, 2017 \"I have no address. Naturally it takes time to find me. I am at all places.\" This is how the fictionalised S.M. Sultan speaks about his nomadic nature of existence in the book entitled Sultan, famously penned by Hasnat Abdul Hye. The scene unfolds with an SDO (a government official) finally getting hold of the maestro who has long been sought after and could not be found in Narail, though he was supposed to head an art school he himself envisioned in the area. To deepen our understanding of the stylistic and philosophical aspects of this modernist who fluidly traversed cultural cannons situated beyond the modernist tradition, the idea of \"existing in all places at the same time\" shall come in handy. The concept of the interstice--which is an in-between space--seems efficacious when it comes to elucidating the life and vision of this modern pioneer. Sultan, aka Laal Miah, in an organic way devised a strategy to simultaneously belong to the past and the present, to the East and the West, to 'here' and 'nowhere'. Due to his unique position vis-a-vis time and place, when Sultan \"makes labour visible\", he does so by skirting round the cultural-industrial expectations of the contemporary society. In an \"article written by S. Amjad Ali for the Pakistan Quarterly (Year 2, Issue 1) the writer refers to Sultan as a 'landscape artist.' In his view, Sultan was an artist who painted landscapes purely from memory in a style which had no fixed identity or roots\" (Golam Dastagir, year 1, issue 2, Depart). No doubt, the maestro made his name by resorting to landscape painting--creating spaces that stemmed from his real encounter with nature, in which he would soon introduce his protagonists, the imaginary peasants. He would also re-visualise them as resistant bodies with augmented muscles to allude to their future potential. The battles he staged between the oppressed and the oppressor sought to undercut the ordeal of the masses as well as the tyranny of the oppressors. The onus of social transformation is unconditionally placed on the shoulders of the people he so lovingly projected as the master of their own destiny eschewing the scenes of violence. To wit, \"When I paint violence on my canvas I look at it only as gesture of protest.\" His, undoubtedly, was a call for social-spiritual awakening.     To get our heads around what is interstitial in Sultan one can begin by mapping his source of inspiration. They come from two seemingly divergent places belonging to the pre-modern times. The murals of the Renaissance Europe, and the murals of the Ajanta caves linked to an Indian Buddhist tradition that spans over eight centuries since 200 BCE, together, one can deduce, forms the basis of his practice. The ambience created with light and shade and is called chiaroscuro in the academic parlance, the muscular figures that verge on the superhuman, testifies to a meditative internalisation of Renaissance art, especially the visual epics of Sistine Chapel a la Michelangelo. The spirit that surges forth in Sultan's pictorial presentation of bodies that are muscular and in movement/rebellion, can be assumed to have sprung from his negotiation of Michelangelo. The timelessness and the natural exuberance in the restive pieces describing rural lives can easily be said to have appeared out of the Ajanta caves. Time and space, often translated as 'here' and 'now' in modernist diction to emphasise the historical breach with the past, is thus kept at bay to prioritise the vision of a coming community.  Finally, to tap the immaterial sensibilities that went into the Sultanian ethos, it can be safely said that the 'sacred' and the 'secular' has been made into 'one' in his realm. The body or, should one say, an assembly of bodies (since the vision has a social-spiritual dimension to it) are seen as a co-conspirator in change. In Sultan's vision, the represented humans are not merely modern-day 'doers' labouring under the misperception of gaining happiness through material pursuit. They are either living in communion with nature, or engaged in an emancipatory social struggle continually working to re-create the world in order to do away with exploitation of the majority by a few. The latter's stake, visible through the age-old category of 'ownership', no doubt, has taken an absolutist turn under the shadow of global capitalism.   Sultan's peasant population thus forms the tip of the iceberg--what remains hidden below the surface is the sacred, which is the intangible spirit found in all kinds of communion--between human and nature, between the individual body and the society body. What is religious in all this is to found in the 'unreal' (vision of the coming society) from within the configuration of the 'real'. As for the public figure he was, Sultan's proverbial liminality kept him at the edge of existence. He found his solace amidst the majority population, stationed as he was in his village of birth away from the urban centres. In the early days, he often appeared in public as Radha wearing a saree, with a flute in his hands, or in the guise of a mythic character or even an entity, through which the myth of Sultan has been weaved into the consciousness of the people who began to see him as a sage of sorts.   Born in 1924 into a subaltern family of Narail, Laal Miah or Sheikh Mohammad Sultan died in 1994 leaving behind a legacy which is yet to be put into context. Any avid reader of his images must look at them as interpretable symbols residing somewhere between an allegory and an unfurling of actual rural reality. One also needs to survey them in the context of the historical battles that had been waged against the zamindars and the British colonial rulers by the people(s) of Bengal. That he was fond of poet Nazrul Islam is not simply a question of taste. Sultan seemed to have drawn a greater portion of his spiritual sustenance from the 'rebel' poet. Nazrul was an interstitial character who categorically challenged the colonial presence by resisting their (mis)rule and the widely circulated knowledge of the colonisers. This was one way of envisioning a free and communistic society for the poet. On another register, his invocation of Nature, Goddess Kaali, as well as the all-pervading yet invisible Creator, have made it difficult for the cognoscenti to delve into his works. In Sultan, the sage-like humility has taken over the outbursts that we witness in many of Nazrul's politically-socially engaged verses. One finds into the personae behind this depicter of trans-spatial beings representing the peasant population the same social-spiritual eye operational with the hope of seeking justice for the oppressed and permanence of social harmony in a communal life lived in an organic setting. Maybe, in today's finance-driven global economy, this vision seems too utopic. But as an artistic vision that transcends the lived reality and even the knowledge and deshi and foreign technology invested in the creation of this unique vision, what it seeks to perpetuate is the idea of returning to \"heaven\", a primordial space that we might reconstruct time and again.

      "text": "Rampant dumping of untreated toxic wastes from textile factories for years has polluted water of the Langulia and Fatikjani rivers in the district. The water is unusable and pollution is threatening aquatic life and crops, locals said. There are about 1,500 small and big yarn dyeing and processing factories at over a dozen weavers' villages beside the two rivers in Kalihati upazila. The local factories have been releasing the untreated toxic wastes into the rivers, defying the factory act. The factories have been running without effluent treatment plants when the factory law says the authorities have to dispose of the chemical wastes in a pond or pit on its compound. The local weavers blamed owners of the riverside yarn processing units for the pollution while the factory owners blamed the riverside weavers. During a recent visit to the weavers' villages -- Balla, Singair, Bir Pakutia, Tenguria, Chhatihati, Behalabari and Ratanganj -- this correspondent saw the polluted and smelly water of the Langulia river flowing into the Fatikjani river. The locals said they cannot use the water for bathing and washing clothes or bathing cattle. Some fishermen told this correspondent that the rivers were full of various fish previously, but those have gone now due to the pollution. Abul Kashem of Bir Pakutia said the water is so polluted that his cattle suffered from diarrhoea after drinking it. Shamim Mia of Balla said local people suffer from different water-borne diseases, including skin, after coming in contact with the polluted water. Elderly person Shishir Das of Balla said the 30-kilometre Langulia river originates from the Jamuna river at Bhuapur upazila and falls into the Fatikjani river in Balla area. The Fatikjani ends at the Bonshai river at Ratanganj in Kalihati upazila. The Langulia started dying after a flood control embankment was constructed in Pachtikri area of Bhuapur upazila, restraining the flow of the river, over two decades ago. Since then, the local influential people started grabbing the river banks, leaving it almost dead, he added. Now only a little amount of water enters the Langulia from the Fatikjani river when it overflows during the rainy season, Shishir said. Deputy Director of the Directorate of Environment Amirul Islam told this correspondent that the boiled water released from the yarn processing factories is not as hazardous as the toxic dye-mixed water dumped by the weavers. \"Necessary steps will be taken against the polluters after investigation into the matter,\" he added."

      "text": "A feeling of dread grips Masud Rana whenever he sees black clouds in Dhaka sky these days. The reason is obvious. A little rain means the same old story of misery, and it's hard to find a city dweller who doesn't share his fright. Streets, lanes and by-lanes get submerged, public transports thin out and traffic stands still even after a moderate rainfall. Yesterday, things were worse after about three hours of hard rain.  Between 12:00 noon and 3:00pm, the Met office recorded 121mm of rain in Dhaka, the highest rainfall in three hours since 2003 when the Dhaka Met office first started to record hour-wise rainfall, said Bazlur Rashid, a meteorologist there.  Since 2003, the highest rain in three hours before yesterday was 96mm in 2010.  \"Heavy rain is normal this time of the year, but 121mm rain in such a short time is a record,\" Bazlur said about yesterday's downpour, adding that more rain was expected in the coming days. As a result of such heavy rain, much of the capital quickly turned into a waterbody. On the waterlogged city streets, buses, private cars and three-wheelers came to a standstill for hours. \"I used to love rain. But now I've come to fear it because commuting on Dhaka streets after rain has become virtually impossible. This can't go on. I don't see any visible steps to solve the problem,\" said Masud, who travels from Dhanmondi-27 to Gulshan-2 five days a week. Experts have no new suggestions to offer. They say inadequate storm-water drainage system managed by seven different authorities with little coordination among themselves is the reason why Dhaka streets suffer deluge every time there is a moderate rain. They do the job haphazardly and have little clue to what the other agencies are doing, they add. In a well-managed network of storm drainage system, rainwater instantly runs into the low-lying retention areas. But, it takes hours for rainwater runoff if the network is faulty or destroyed, leading to immense public sufferings. As there was a heavy rainfall in a short time yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. The worst-affected areas in the capital include Shantinagar, Khilgaon, Bashabo, Malibagh, Shantibagh, Rajarbagh, Mugda, Mohammadpur, Badda and different parts of Old Dhaka. In the sunken city, almost all commuters had a similar story to tell. Abdul Jalil, 60, got on a bus in front of the Jatiya Press Club around 2:30pm amid heavy rain. The bus took more than one and a half hours to reach Engineers Institute, around a kilometre from the Press Club. He sat still in the bus for half an hour more, all the while hoping that the bus would move. \"We were stranded like hostage. I felt so helpless. I could not get down even after the rain stopped as the road went under knee-deep water with filth floating,\" said Jalil, a private jobholder. However, finding no alternative, he eventually started walking towards Farmgate where he works. \"Even the footpath went under water. It was a terrible situation,\" he added. Having remained stuck in the traffic for hours, many walked miles to reach their destinations. A huge number of people were seen walking just by the central reservation as much of the Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue stretching from Karwan Bazar underpass to the first footbridge at Farmgate was inundated, forcing vehicles to move slowly. In some places, fire servicemen were seen helping people cross water-clogged streets on towable tubes. Brigadier General Ali Ahmed Khan, director general of Fire Service and Civil Defence, said they bought towable tubes for flood situation but now they deployed those in different areas of Dhaka and Chittagong for the service of people, especially the elderly, women and students, who got stuck in waterlogging. Such tubes were deployed in Mirpur, Notre Dame College, Bangabhaban areas, he said. Sanjida Khanam, a housewife from Sukrabad, had been facing severe problem to get her kids to school in Dhanmondi for the last two days. \"I had to struggle to get a rickshaw in the morning, but then got stuck in jam. It took me around an hour to reach the school,\" she said yesterday. Maksud Reza, a banker, said he had to wait for around an hour to get on a bus after office hour. \"There were a handful of buses but those were crammed with passengers. It took me around three hours to reach my home in Kalabagan from Banani,\" he said. Bishwajit Roy, a private service holder, said he had to walk for around one hour to go to Farmgate from Shantinagar as no rickshaw or CNG would take him due to waterlogging. \"On my way, I saw an elderly man falling into water while wading through near Karwan Bazar. He hurt his legs,\" he said. Zina Tasreen, a resident of Mohakhali DOHS, said a large part of the posh neighbourhood went under knee-deep water on Wednesday noon. \"Residents parked their cars in dry parts of the area and away from their plots. To get to the cars, they have to hop on rickshaws to avoid the unclean water,\" she said."

Thousands of people on both sides of the Chitra river in Barobazar union under Kaliganj upazila of Jhenidah are badly suffering for want of a concrete bridge, reports our correspondent. People of 20 villages of two unions use a bamboo bridge on the river as there are two markets, a college, two high schools and a hospital in the area. \"We are in trouble due to lack of a permanent bridge. Our children face risk while going to school. Recently, an elderly women slipped from the shako [bamboo bridge],\" said Md Mohiuddin of Barpa village. The farmers face problem while carrying their produces to the market, locals said. UP member Abdur Razzak of Mongolpaita village said the authorities have allocated Tk 3.37 crore for construction of a bridge at the spot. Work for the 66-metre-long bridge will start soon, said Obhijit Kumar Biswas, sub-assistant engineer of Kaliganj upazila. Our Faridpur Correspondent reports: Thousands of people of Ujanchar union under Goalanda upazila in Rajbari and Ishan Gopalpur union of Sadar upazila in Faridpur are suffering for want of a permanent bridge over a canal. People of at least 30 villages of the two districts use a bamboo bridge to cross the canal flowing between Anando Bazar and Sahajuddin Matbor Para areas to go to their destinations, including the district headquarters, educational institutions and bazars but the bridge has turned risky due to overuse, locals said. \"We live in the border area of two districts, so no one takes care of us,\" said Mostafa Sheikh, 37, a shopkeeper of Ananda Bazar.  Abul Hossain Fakir, chairman of Ujanchar Union Parishad (UP), said he has urged the authorities concerned for building a permanent bridge to ease communication in the area. Mizanur Rahman Mojnu, chairman of Ishan Gopalpur UP, said, \"We have sent a proposal to the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives for building a bridge. I hope the problem will be solved in a short time.\" Our Rangamati Correspondent adds: Several thousand people of Dewanpara village in Ghagra union under the district's Kawkhali upazila are facing untold sufferings as a locally important bridge, which was badly damaged during last year's rains, is yet to be repaired. Specially affected are the children who have to regularly cross the bridge to go to school. Farmers are also facing problem to carry their produce to Ghagra Bazar. Local Government and Engineering Department built the 200-metre-long bridge in 2013 for movement of light vehicles and crossing it on foot but no vehicles can use it after the damage, said officials of Ghagra Union Parishad. Visiting the area last week, this correspondent saw people crossing the bridge amid risk. Jagodish Chakma, chairman of Ghagra Union Parishad, said he told the authorities concerned to repair the bridge."

Achievements and progress in all fields--from manufacturing to cricket, and from architectural excellence to social indicators--open up new prospects and promises for Bangladesh. PricewaterhouseCoopers, in its global economic projection for 2050, estimates that Bangladesh can potentially become the world's 28th largest economy by 2030, surpassing countries like Australia, Spain, South Africa, and Malaysia in economic growth. But there are also challenges when things move rapidly. As economic and social transformations are ultimately related to realisations on the ground, on impacts to the physical and infrastructural landscape, a robust and integrated planning is required to deal with changes. We are reminded of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's call for a \"comprehensive planning... rather than doing something today, something else tomorrow, and something else day after... which will not solve problems\" (1972). Planning at such a scale requires embracing a new imagination as conventional ones are not enough to deal with the enormity of changes. In visualising the future, we need an adjustment of the mental map of Bangladesh. A nation is not only narrated and officiated but also visualised; visualisation provides powerful perspectives for re-viewing the nation. The research and design team at Bengal Institute presents here a possible outline of that new map. While the Bangladesh government, and its different ministries and agencies, as well as some international agencies, have proposed bold ideas and schemes in various documents (especially the government Seven Year Plan), our future map adopts some of those ideas, includes additional ones, and presents them as an integrated image so that its starts to circulate in the national imaginary. Water will remain the raison d'etre of Bangladesh. A hydrological thinking should be the foremost basis for a new imaginary, and consequently any planning action in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a unique chemistry of land and water. It is not all about land, but land and water. Bangladesh is not only deltaic, it is also estuarian. We have only imagined a riverine Bangladesh--Bangladesh can also be re-visioned as also being oceanic. A hydrological consciousness will provide a fuller understanding of the dynamics of water--its flows and counterflows, and its deep implications in the economic, ecological and life-world of the people. Issues of climate change are intimately connected to the realm of water. If sustainable development is to be treated seriously, in Bangladesh it ought to be begin and end with water. As Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has clearly directed: water needs to flow, silt managed with new initiatives, and riverbanks planned with new ideas. While the economy has become the most powerful parameter of national development, economic drivers must align with ecological imperatives and life-world conditions. Land strapped, on the one hand, and demographically challenged, on the other hand, Bangladesh requires the planning and management of every square inch of its territory. A new physical planning is needed that redefines the territory of the nation, and frames new regional formations advancing the potential of each region. What is needed, next in scale to the region, is a re-visioning of settlement and landscape patterns, and preparing a national agenda for an urban future. We have to admit that while Bangladesh maintains a rural ethos, it also has become a \"country of towns.\" New visions for cities and towns require standpoints on where should cities be, what should be the footprint of each city, what should be its civic constituents, what should be the population, how it should relate to agriculture and flood-plains, and how each one can be consolidated with its own potentials, growth spurs and connectivity to neighbours. Similar questions should be asked for settlements at any scale, from the very rural to the semi-urban. Development of a country cannot be based only on five or ten-year plans. \"To envision the future,\" as Abul Khair, as chairman of the executive board of Bengal Institute insists, \"a hundred-year plan is needed.\" Pointing out Prof Abdur Razzaq's truism that a developmental imaginary for Bangladesh will have to consider three resources--land, people and rivers--Abul Khair adds culture and tradition to it. With maps and diagrams, we offer summary points for the imagined future. To see details of the map above, click here.\nRETERRITORIALISING BANGLADESH\nAn achievement of the present government, rearrangement of Bangladesh's international waters unleashes new possibilities, and encourages us to revise the understanding of the map that has so far prioritised land territory. With the opening up of an oceanic territory into the Bay of Bengal, new settlement, economic and transport opportunities are possible with a marine vision. We strongly support the 7th Five Year Plan (2016) that presented the value of a \"blue economy\" based on an oceanic scenario. While a prospect of that magnitude requires a huge infrastructural and planning investment, there is no reason to hesitate in slowly going into the seas.\nBangladesh is a terrain of water. From ancient to contemporary times, the presence of water in the form of rivers, canals and various water bodies has been inscribed in the imagination and practices of the people. The terrain should now be expanded. Riverine Bangladesh should flow into the imagination of an Oceanic Bangladesh. The Bay of Bengal can be the new frontier of Bangladesh offering a new and vast terrain of inhabitation, productivity and opportunity.\nSETTLEMENTS SHOULD BE REIMAGINED\nUtilising sedimentation in the Bay (700 million tons deposited annually at the mouth of Meghna estuary), we can imagine a new coastal landscape for Bangladesh that expands its territorial dimensions. We imagine an \"archipelago of sea-towns\" on artificial shoals and islands, and other constructed platforms, connected by causeways. While this will require massive infrastructural and investment input, and consideration of marine ecology and complex oceanic dynamic, this may be conceived through a careful combination of landfill, and offshore, floating, hybrid, and submerged structures. Construction of sea barrier walls can work as buffer against tidal surges and tsunamis.\nAn archipelago of sea-towns will be a uniquely constructed landscape hosting major industries and economic zones, with proper housing and urban amenities, as well as facilities for marine fishing and processing. Major port facilities may be installed there, perhaps with Payra as a hub of this projected development. It will be possible to install energy production hubs there utilising the environmental conditions of the sea. As part of the national initiative to face climate change, the constructed islands can be adaptive mechanism to face sea level change. In a landfill process, waste from the mainland can be collected and placed on artificial islets after proper processing (similar to Singapore's offshore landfill Semakau).\nThere are many examples of sea-based developments. Seasteading Institute has been advocating a sea-faring society, Singapore has land-fill projects in the sea, Florida has numerous sealinks through its marine islands, the Dutch are building a seawall with new town development in the seas off Jakarta, and of course, half of Netherlands is built on the sea.\nRIVERS CAN GENERATE NEW POSSIBILITIES\nBangladesh is a land of liquid flows, dominated by the dynamics of riverine ecosystems made of rapidly moving and slow-moving waters, and areas of inundation. While the flow is generally towards the Bay, other complex forms of flows and overflows determine more localised conditions, and together create the character of the extensive delta system. Resilience and sustainability of the country undoubtedly depends on an intelligent but delicate management of the riverine ecosystem.\nSilt--a production of river flows--is liquid land. Silt management rather than river management, should be a non-stop process with modernised, mechanised methods. Bringing more depth to rivers and canals by dredging, new riverbanks may be created by silt deposits.\nRivers as natural infrastructure remains as major lines of communication but can become more active and effective with better river management, shoreline planning, and modern water vehicles. If most cargo movement happens on rivers, roads may become freed from trucks and other vehicles. With modernised river dredging and planned silt depositing, shorelines can be planned for new habitation and architectural typologies, riverside forestation, and commercial setups. As the prime minister presciently noted in a recent meeting, this opens up new land opportunities that do not exist now.\nENERGY INNOVATION IS A NECESSITY\nEnergy will continue to be a critical factor in elevating Bangladesh towards a new economy, and maintaining that position. While conventional energy sources will remain, it is also time to consider newer sources, most desirably renewable ones. Energy from solar, wind, and other methods need exploration at a large scale. Again, a coastal/oceanic territory offers opportunities in harnessing newer forms of energy. With the oceanic landscape as the site, battery of energy producing hubs or farms may be constructed harnessing solar and wind conditions, and tidal wave movement or sea current.\nBased on a study of working examples elsewhere, we calculate that one acre of solar farm may yield 145 MWh of electrical energy. Similarly, an acre of wind farm but based on a larger setup may yield 139 MWh, while a tidal barrage with an enclosed reservoir of 5000 acres may produce about 90 MWh per acre.\nDISTRIBUTED URBANISM\nIn a country where land is scarce, we have to be inventive in creating spaces of habitation. A consolidated national plan is required to tame and manage the wild urbanisation that defines the current process. An immediate need is to decide on and configure the settlements patterns as they impact the footprint of development, and form a disruptive relationship with agricultural land (affecting food security), wetlands and floodplains (impacting ecological and bio-diverse conditions). While we give more attention to metropolitan centres in our urban discourse, a similar attention is needed for smaller towns and other aggregations.\n\nA key issue in tomorrow's Bangladesh will be the state of urbanisation and housing the extra population expected by 2040. Planned agglomeration and distribution of future population will be critical for a sustainable economic and social development. Population projection puts the urban population at 83 million in 2041 (BBS), almost double of the current 44 million (BBS). At present, Dhaka city alone hosts 16 million people, with a density of 50 thousand per sq km. If the current trends of Dhaka-centric development continue in 2040, the city will have to accommodate another 30-35 million people. Chittagong, the next big city after Dhaka, has a population of 2.5 million with a density of 16000 per sq km. No other divisional headquarters has a population over 0.6 million (except Khulna).\nFor a balanced development, Bangladesh will need to have \"metro cities\" beyond Dhaka which can absorb the extra population. By 2041, we can plan for 7-8 metro-hubs with 5 million each, 10 medium cities with 1 million plus each, and 40 smaller towns with 0.5 million each. Each of the metro cities, including Dhaka, can have a networked region composed of small and medium cities and villages in-between.\nBeing a country with a huge population in a small geographic boundary, Bangladesh needs to have cities with high density. Density, often cited as the culprit for urban ills, is not a factor in creating such liveable, walkable places such as Mong Kok in Hong Kong with a density of 130,000 people per sq km.\nPopulation and density are associated with the footprint of settlements. For future redistribution of population, the metro cities can have a density of 20,000 per square kilometre that will require a footprint 250 sq km (for a total population of 5 million). The medium and small cities can have density of 10,000 and 8,000 with areas of 100 sq km and 60 sq km respectively.\nECOLOGY CAN BE PART OF A DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY\nEcological sustainability can be an ally to economic drivers. Despite its small territorial entity, Bangladesh is a land of geographical diversity. While the predominant narrative is around river kissed flood plains, there are unique hills, haors and forests.\nEcosystems are not abstractions; they provide actual and real values to its human inhabitants. Each ecological zone has both economic and existential values providing a unique and rich source of life-sustaining materials (see An Atlas of Landscapes). Any national development that disregards the complex, multi-dimensional ecosystems will produce a fragile, short-sighted scenario.\nEcological processes can be created or jump-started. An exemplary possibility is char forestation. Char-lands cover approximately 6 percent of the total land area of the country (CEGIS, 2000). On the other hand, Bangladesh has a forest area of about 11.2 percent of the total area of the country (ADB, 2016). Between 1990 and 2010, the country has lost 840,000 hectare of forest cover at a rate of 42,000 ha per year (FAO). At least 25 percent forest cover is essential for maintaining biodiversity and ensuring ecological goods and services, such as clean air, clean water, carbon sequestration, and flood control in a country. As a result, Bangladesh is in dire need of increasing its greenery in order to achieve environmental sustainability. An increase in forest cover can happen through afforestation, reforestation and natural expansion of forests. Chars that are not eroded in the first four years of their emergence could be used for forestation, cultivation or settlement, and a renewed functioning of the ecosystem.\nNEW REGIONAL FORMATIONS CAN TRIGGER ECONOMIC DIVIDENDS\nRedefined regions can be the basis for development strategies for economic investments, urban clustering, and landscape management. Bangladesh is already formed by regional varieties defined by geographic and cultural distinctiveness that is often aligned with administrative boundaries. New urban clusters--conurbations--may be planned according to the economic and ecological potentials and conditions of each region.\n\"Dhaka Nexus\" is a proposed regionalisation of Dhaka and its surrounds that reorganises the ensemble of towns and settlements in a two-hour or less travel distance around Dhaka, along with a revision of transport network. The goal of Dhaka Nexus is to deflect singular attention on Dhaka city, and decongest it. Other regions may be imagined that also deflect attention away from Dhaka, but more importantly heighten the potentials of those regions. We imagine the following regional formations around towns upgraded as \"metrohubs,\" each one according to its new regional potential: Chittagong, Rangpur, Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Mymensingh, Comilla and Barisal.\nDigitisation and electronic network is the new reality, the properties of which are going to expand exponentially. Regionalisation and new clustering of towns will become effective with adoption of various digital services (in education, recreation, and employment), and which will not require frequent travel to the metropolitan centres.\nNODES AND ROADS FORM AXES OF DEVELOPMENT\nA transformation of settlement patterns requires an equally robust overhaul of the national transport system. People are now moving more than ever, from one town to another, from one region to another, and even from the nation to the beyond. Movement of goods remains the backbone of the economic dynamic. Existing networks of movement--rail, road and river--need to be reorganised, augmented, and transformed. While all these involve long-term engagements, our point is to consider them in the future physical planning of Bangladesh.\nWe imagine two major north-south transport axes running the full length of the country: the Rangpur-Payra Axis, and the Sylhet-Cox's Bazar Axis. An east-west link may be imagined connecting Sylhet and Bogra via Mymensingh, one that is non-existent now. Cross links connect other cities and towns. A river-sea link may connect Dhaka and Chittagong via Barisal. Transnational axes of movement may link different points outside the country. With rivers as a pre-existing infrastructure and after being dredged, they can become major arteries for cargo movement lessening the load on road traffic.\nTourism, a very under-performing sector, can benefit from transport developments. With Bangladesh's rich tapestry of landscapes and warm confluence of traditions, international tourism can be a highly profitable enterprise if organised with national planning of tourist nodes and transport corridors.\nPLANNED HABITATS AND FOOD SECURITY ARE RELATED\nBangladesh has made great strides in food production, but at the same time arable land has decreased from 73 percent in 1989 to 59 percent to 2012 (according to FAO). In our over-zealousness to develop metropolitan infrastructural spectacles, let us not forget food security for the nation unless we want to fashion ourselves as a service economy like Singapore or Dubai. Additionally, climate change may affect the complex, diverse and sensitive ecosystems that are foundations of food production.\nPlanned agglomeration of habitats, settlements and industries with precise footprints need to be determined, with releasing rest of land for agriculture, as well as hydrological flows. Traditional land division and homestead distribution have not helped in consolidating productive land. Consolidation of villages can provide cohesive communities, concentrated services and utilities, efficient roadways, and open up land for large-scale agricultural and fish cultivation.\nConsolidation of villages may allow creating new social, informational and cultural hubs.\nWith Bangladesh's 80,000 villages, Abul Khair imagines such a hub for a cluster of four villages. Each hub on a 15 bigha land may have playfields and clubs to cater to drama, music, and other recreational activities. In the towns, many of the old movie halls may be mobilised as new cultural hubs.\nResearch and design were directed by Kazi Khaleed Ashraf and Saif Ul Haque with Masudul Islam and Nusrat Sumaiya and team at Bengal Institute. Team members who contributed to these features are: Tazrin Ahmed, Dhrubo Alam, Muntakim Haque, Maria Kipti, Rifat Ara Mostafa, Rubaiya Nasrin, Mahmudur Rahman Rafat, Arfar Razi, Afreen Ahmed Rochana, Sumaita Tahseen, and Zarin Tasnim.\nSee Rethinking Urban Spaces for more articles from our special supplement\n  RETERRITORIALISING BANGLADESH An achievement of the present government, rearrangement of Bangladesh's international waters unleashes new possibilities, and encourages us to revise the understanding of the map that has so far prioritised land territory.

We imagine the following regional formations around towns upgraded as \"metrohubs,\" each one according to its new regional potential: Chittagong, Rangpur, Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Mymensingh, Comilla and Barisal. Digitisation and electronic network is the new reality, the properties of which are going to expand exponentially. Regionalisation and new clustering of towns will become effective with adoption of various digital services (in education, recreation, and employment), and which will not require frequent travel to the metropolitan centres. NODES AND ROADS FORM AXES OF DEVELOPMENT A transformation of settlement patterns requires an equally robust overhaul of the national transport system. People are now moving more than ever, from one town to another, from one region to another, and even from the nation to the beyond. Movement of goods remains the backbone of the economic dynamic. Existing networks of movement--rail, road and river--need to be reorganised, augmented, and transformed. While all these involve long-term engagements, our point is to consider them in the future physical planning of Bangladesh. We imagine two major north-south transport axes running the full length of the country: the Rangpur-Payra Axis, and the Sylhet-Cox's Bazar Axis. An east-west link may be imagined connecting Sylhet and Bogra via Mymensingh, one that is non-existent now. Cross links connect other cities and towns. A river-sea link may connect Dhaka and Chittagong via Barisal. Transnational axes of movement may link different points outside the country. With rivers as a pre-existing infrastructure and after being dredged, they can become major arteries for cargo movement lessening the load on road traffic. Tourism, a very under-performing sector, can benefit from transport developments. With Bangladesh's rich tapestry of landscapes and warm confluence of traditions, international tourism can be a highly profitable enterprise if organised with national planning of tourist nodes and transport corridors. PLANNED HABITATS AND FOOD SECURITY ARE RELATED Bangladesh has made great strides in food production, but at the same time arable land has decreased from 73 percent in 1989 to 59 percent to 2012 (according to FAO). In our over-zealousness to develop metropolitan infrastructural spectacles, let us not forget food security for the nation unless we want to fashion ourselves as a service economy like Singapore or Dubai. Additionally, climate change may affect the complex, diverse and sensitive ecosystems that are foundations of food production. Planned agglomeration of habitats, settlements and industries with precise footprints need to be determined, with releasing rest of land for agriculture, as well as hydrological flows. Traditional land division and homestead distribution have not helped in consolidating productive land. Consolidation of villages can provide cohesive communities, concentrated services and utilities, efficient roadways, and open up land for large-scale agricultural and fish cultivation. Consolidation of villages may allow creating new social, informational and cultural hubs. With Bangladesh's 80,000 villages, Abul Khair imagines such a hub for a cluster of four villages. Each hub on a 15 bigha land may have playfields and clubs to cater to drama, music, and other recreational activities. In the towns, many of the old movie halls may be mobilised as new cultural hubs.

      "text": "In almost every global assessment of which countries are most vulnerable to climate change impacts, Bangladesh comes out as either first or at least in the top five, depending on the criteria used in the assessment. Thus, Bangladesh is now globally well known to be one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. The government and people of Bangladesh are now in the process of changing that narrative to making Bangladesh into the most climate resilient country in the world. As the impacts of climate change vary from place to place, methods of adaptations to tackle the impacts must also take local conditions into account. Thus the impacts in coastal Bangladesh will be different from the Haor basin in the north east which in turn will be different from the Barind Tract in the north-west of Bangladesh. I was recently in Rajshahi and Bogra for a meeting with researchers, government officials, NGOs and other stakeholders working on the problems of the Barind Tract, so I will focus on what I saw there. The first point to make is to describe the particular situation of the region and how it is vulnerable to climate change. The region consists of two types of geology, namely the High Barind and the floodplain Barind. The former is a somewhat higher land which is dissected or undulating. A long time ago, the region had lots of forests and wild animals but over the last century, it lost most of its tree cover and became very dry and almost like a desert. However, since the eighties, there has been a massive tree planting programme together with the discovery of underground water which could be used for irrigation of high-yielding rice, and the region has been transformed for the better in recent decades. However, with climate change, predictions are that there would be far more erratic rainfall in future and the thousands of deep tube-wells that are being used are in danger of over-extracting the available groundwater. Hence, there clearly needs to be an emphasis on using less water requiring crops as well as more use of surface water wherever possible. At the same time, the social and economic situation in the region has its own peculiarities with sizeable populations of Adivasis and also significant populations living in river islands called chars who are amongst the most vulnerable groups in the country. Hence, the adaptation strategies that need to be adopted, and are already being piloted, need to both address changes in crops as well as focusing on the most vulnerable populations in the region. Amongst the promising options being piloted are cattle rearing in the chars and mango orchards in the land which are showing positive results. However, one of the major bottlenecks is marketing the products, as seen this year with excess supply of potatoes which could not be sold. One promising option is to explore export markets for some of the products such as mangoes. Another bottleneck that was identified was the lack of coordination and difficulty to scale up the many successful pilot activities. One concept that is being looked at to tackle this issue is Integrated Land Management (ILM) which brings together all the relevant actors working in the same landscape and tries to ensure synergies across them. In conclusion, it is clear that the Barind Tract in North West Bangladesh is one of the most climate vulnerable zones of the country which will need special focus in future adaptation planning to transform it into a resilient Barind Tract. A similar approach will also be needed in other vulnerable zones such as the coastal areas, haors, Hill Tracts and flood prone zones.

I wanted to experience what seemed like a Bangladesh in transition, particularly how economic development was changing the country's geography. These trips provided me with invaluable insights into the country's changing natural environment. From Sylhet and Sunamganj to Rajshahi and Rangpur, from Barisal and Jhalokati to Patuakhali, Barguna and Kuakata, Bangladesh felt like a country pulsating with new energy, some inspiring, some chaotic, some dystopic. One of the great pleasures of these trips was my ability to cross many rivers, the epic stories engraved on the Bengal delta. The waters of Titas, Surma, Kushiyara, Karatoya, Padma, Jamuna, Ichamati, Atrai, Dhanshiri, Gorai, Arial Khan, Kirtankhola, Lohalia, and many others undoubtedly shaped the aquatic personality of the land. Crossing rivers in search of something or anything felt like a unique Bengali phenomenon. I was convinced anew that rivers are what that make Bengal Bengal. My trips left me feeling inspired, yet heartbroken. It seemed as if our rivers were under attack. Economic growth, infrastructure development, industrialisation, the rapid spread of the built environment, sand mining, misuse of river waters, and population boom seemed to have taken a toll on the rivers, canals, and wetlands of the country. Illegal encroachments into rivers, indiscriminate dumping of industrial waste, brickfields on river banks, consistent littering, greasy pollutants from motorised boats, siltation, and a general lack of public awareness of river ecology--all appear to contribute to the country's progressively unhealthy aquatic state. The alarming message that emerges from all of this is that despite living in a delta for millennia, Bengalis have not learned how to live sustainably with, on, and around water. As a nation, we have long romanticised our liquid deltaic landscape with poems, songs, films, and literature but we have not internalised how to treat our rivers with respect and gratitude. This paradox is ironic, given the hydro-geography of our country. The delta of the Padma-Meghna-Jamuna river system and its intricate network of tributaries account for 80 percent of the country's landmass. The higher grounds of the Madhupur and Barind Tracts at the centre and northwest occupy only 9 percent, while the hilly region of the southeast and northeast occupies 12 percent. What does this tell us? Bangladesh is a land of water and flat lowlands. Most elevations of the country are less than 10m above sea level, while the southern coastal regions are more or less at sea level. Imagine what would happen to countries like Bangladesh, the Netherlands, the Maldives, the Marshall Islands, and Kiribati, and coastal cities like Osaka, Rio de Janeiro, Shanghai, Alexandria, Miami, and Manhattan with 1m sea-level rise by, say, 2100. There is credible data affirming that an increase of 3 degrees Celsius due to global warming would cause sea-level rise of two metres. If that is the case, much of the southern coastal regions of Bangladesh are likely to be submerged by water. That brings me to my crucial contention today. What are we going to do in Bangladesh about the real prospect of climate change and sea-level rise? What should we do when floodwaters come? Continuing to fill up lowlands with sand mined from riverbeds will be fatal for Bangladesh. We need strong urban and environmental policies to encourage living with and on water. We need to develop an aquatic lifestyle. We need to learn how to live resiliently in a wetter Bangladesh. A million climate refugees could be transformed into dynamic communities that see water not as a threat, but more as a fluctuating resource to survive with sustainably. The idea of fishing or aqua-nomadic communities living on water should become mainstream in Bangladesh. Inhabitable boats could be a strong trope for new types of urbanisation. The floodplains of Purbachal didn't have to be a 6,000-plus-acre dystopia of sand, mined from rivers across the country, irreversibly damaging this deltaic land's life-sustaining river ecology. Instead, Eastern Dhaka could have been a prime example of aquatic urbanisation. Rather than trying to defeat water, we should celebrate it and live with it. This concept is hardly futuristic. Such adaptive living with water is already happening in countries with prudent public policies for a hydrologic future. Consider the Netherlands, a country with much of its landmass below sea level. For instance, 90 percent of the city of Rotterdam lies below sea level. This waterlogged nation survived for ages by pumping water and building a coastal defence system to keep ocean water out. The need to survive against the threat of water has in many ways shaped the national identity of the Netherlands.  However, a new philosophy for water management has been taking shape in the Netherlands for quite some time. The new struggle is not to try to tame Mother Nature but to live with her in harmony. Given the prospect of rising tides and fiercer storms, the futility of trying to keep water out has become apparent. The new idea is to let water in, with some measure of control, and create buildings that would not only survive in floodwater but also transform rising tides into a resource.    For example, self-sufficient floating houses have been built in the IJburg neighbourhood, artificial islands created on IJmeer Lake, not far from Amsterdam. Buoyant concrete bases, partially submerged in the water, provide the \"foundation\" for floating homes. A lightweight supporting steel structure, along with wooden walls, rooms and other domestic facilities, is built upon the floating concrete tub. The submerged portion of the structure contains living quarters, along with bathrooms and other service spaces. The water-level floor includes functional spaces like kitchen and dining spaces. The main living area is on the upper level with overlooking terraces. This is a boat in the shape of a traditional house. The novelty lies in mainstreaming aquatic domesticity.  With a growing shortage of buildable land, unpredictable shoreline and rising sea level, the idea of self-sustaining floating structures and \"hydropolises\" to house people has become a policy priority. These innovations are especially crucial for countries facing climate-change challenges. While there have been sporadic and individual efforts in Bangladesh to create water-based living (for instance, solar-powered boat schools), aquatic living is still marginal to hegemonic land-centric development regimes. Both public and private sectors must undertake primary data-based research on the topic. City development authorities like RAJUK and city corporations across Bangladesh must develop dedicated research wings within their organisation that would generate new knowledge for future environmental adaptations. As I crossed the Andharmanik River near Barisal, the Surma River in Sylhet, and other rivers in Bangladesh, I realised, again, what Bangladesh was about. Not only should we protect our rivers by law, we should also quickly learn how to live with, around, and on them. The sooner we start thinking hard about aquatic urbanisation, the better. Like the Netherlands, it is an existential question for us.

      "text": "The Korotoa river in Bogra is nearly choking as the waters run low and pollutants are pumped in from the municipality sewerage and local industries. The dissolved oxygen rate is three times below the recommended rate for seven to eight months a year, mostly during the dry seasons when the water flow dips further, according to monthly reports by the environmental office in Bogra. The once-mighty Korotoa, that enters Bangladesh through the Rangpur district, runs 106 kilometres across Bogra. A fisherman, Nityananda Das, 45, from Demazani (palpara) village under Shahjahanpur upazila, said, \"There is no water and no fish in the waters anymore; how can we survive in this profession? \"In my early years, we used to catch a variety of fish from the river. But now there are only a few varieties, like Taki and Shoal,\" he added. According a report by Rural Development Academy (RDA) in Bogra, heavily-loaded vessels used to ply the waters of Korotoa almost 90 years ago. Rishikesh Pall, a potter from Shahjahanpur upazila of Bogra, said, \"When there was enough water to carry the big boats 25-30 years ago, traders used to come in and buy 30,000-40,000 pots of our stock. But now, sales are barely enough to sustain us as we have to sell our products by walking for miles.\" The Department of Environment (DoE), Rajshahi divisional office, Bogra, regularly examines water samples at eight points of the river. They have found alarmingly low rates of dissolved oxygen. According to the water analysis report, the dissolved oxygen (DO) rate is only 2-3 mg per litre at Korotoa, while it is 6-7 mg in other rivers in Rajshahi division. The rate of the dissolved oxygen in river water should ideally be at 4.5-8, as per the Environment Conservation Rules. Moreover, the reports show some rate of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and a lack of biological oxygen demand (BOD), which jeopardises river water quality. Md Masud Rana, a chemist at the Bogra environment office, said, \"COD normally does not exist in river water, but in Korotoa, we get it regularly. A lack of sufficient oxygen and existing chemicals have a bad impact on the ecology of the river,\" he said. The report also shows that the water of Korotoa is acidic as it has a low pH of below 7. It is much higher in other rivers in Rajshahi division. The suspended, colloidal and dissolved solids in a water sample from Korotoa (measured as total solid and total dissolved solids) are also comparatively higher, the report shows. It is 180-220 mg/l in Korotoa, while it is 60-180 mg/l in the other rivers in the region. \"Total solids (TS) can come from various types of runoff like fertilisers from agricultural lands, calcium carbonate, industrial waste, effluent from water treatment plants, etc. The high rate of TS can harm the biotic community, decrease the rate of photosynthesis and increase the temperature of the river water,\" said Md Faruk Ahmed, assistant professor of the chemistry department of the Govt. Azizul Haque College, Bogra. There are several small to midsized factories and clinics and hospitals along the banks of the river, which release harmful chemicals and waste into the water, said an official of the environment department in Rajshahi. Most factories do not have effluent treatment plants (ETP) or environment clearance certificates and they are polluting Korotoa's waters, the official added. \"Even, the Essential Drugs Company Limited (EDCL) that produces medicine for the government does not run the ETP properly. It has only one ETP to manage dry waste, but nothing for fluid waste.\" SM Ahsan, deputy general manager of EDCL, said, \"We have one old ETP built in 1983 by Japanese engineers. We have already offered a tender to build a modern ETP.\" Md Ashrafuzzaman, director of the DoE, Rajshahi divisional office in Bogra, said, \"We regularly collect water samples from the Korotoa, examine it and send a report to the Dhaka office. The industrial waste and the sewerage water flows into the Korotoa, and due to a lack of water flow, the old waste gathers on the river basin. Therefore, the oxygen level in the water is decreasing day by day,\" the director added. Md Hasan Mahmud, executive engineer of the water development board in Bogra, said, \"Due to implementation of the Nurulla Beel project (1992-1996) and the Khulshi three vents regulator (flood control project) on downstream Korotoa in the Gobindaganj upazila, the water sources of the Korotoa was discarded and the silt basin rose by 5-7 feet for a stretch of almost 1.5-2 kilometres along the project.\""

A news item printed in this paper cited the report on October 12: \"Today, 98 percent of Bangladesh's population has access to water from technologically-improved sources, but E. coli contamination was found present in 80 percent of household tap-water across the country...In Bangladesh, more than one-third of children under [the age of] five are stunted, limiting their ability to grow and learn.\" Furthermore, \"Bangladesh has made great strides in expanding access to water and can build on that progress by focusing on improving the quality of water and sanitation.\" Water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) is a very important issue of public health. Unfortunately, despite best efforts, the country has not been able to tackle the issue effectively. Without good WASH, we have seen an onslaught of chronic intestinal infections that have caused stunting amongst children. Children who are stunted fail to grow to full physical structure and mental capabilities. With diarrhoea comes the problem of not being able to attend school regularly. Chronic diarrhoea leads to severe malnutrition. These ailments need to be addressed as they come from poor quality drinking water. The country has made significant progress in preceding decades where the population (according to WB data) \"experienced a 20-percentage point gain in water access and 29-percentage point gain in sanitation since 1990.\" But the problem is elsewhere. While it is estimated that 98 percent of the population is drinking from a \"technologically-improved water source\", we are squarely dependent on groundwater. Groundwater extraction has brought about other problems like arsenic poisoning. Our overdependence on groundwater is due to the fact that our natural water resources are heavily contaminated. Over the last few decades, unprecedented discharge of untreated chemical waste from factories has all but killed most rivers around major urban centres. With the water being too polluted to be treated, people have had to turn to groundwater extraction. While technology has played a major part in making water somewhat drinkable, we still have to contend with the fact that 3 percent of the population is using unimproved water resources, \"which translates to nearly 4 million Bangladeshis continuing to draw drinking water from ponds, rivers, streams, or unprotected wells and springs.\" The pollution level of the rivers has reached a point where even groundwater with all its trappings is considered a safer option. The time has come to address the problems of our water infrastructure where faecal bacteria, arsenic, salinity have become major issues. Whenever there is a natural calamity like cyclone or flash flood, people in the affected areas are forced to resort to unsafe water from ponds or other highly polluted surface water sources because tube-wells are no longer accessible. So how can the vast majority of the population get access to a supply of clean, uncontaminated water that is safe to drink? It is not merely about good infrastructure, i.e. having sturdy piped lines to households, public institutions and schools. The fact is that we have an institutional challenge on our hands which inhibits delivery of high-quality service delivery. The issue that comes through in the report is that government institutions at the local government level, \"including union parishads (UPs), pourashavas, and city corporations, do not have the technical nor financial capacity to deliver and sustain high-quality WASH services. Instead, central agencies play multiple roles of financing, designing, implementing, and regulating WASH investments, blurring incentives and accountability of service provision in these areas.\" With little incentive to improve services, responsible agencies often fail to implement the WASH strategy that already exists. There is a need for a proper regulatory framework to govern which agency will do what and in which area. We need standards, monitoring and accountability mechanisms in place that will ensure that budgetary allocations are well spent. That policymakers do not prioritise this issue is reflected in the steady decline in budgetary allocation for WASH services in the budget: \"The WASH budget allocation was less than half of what it was in 2007-08, internal and external budgets show similar declines. The estimated total budget gap is about 47 percent of the total allocation in the sector to meet just the government's envisioned water targets by 2025.\" Clearly there is a whole array of issues that have to be tackled head on. One of the biggest problems is of course how to keep faecal sludge from entering the water supply. Studies estimate that only about one to two percent of all faecal sludge is safely managed in urban cities, but we have no data about rural areas. Our regulatory mechanisms need to be geared towards handling intrusion into and contamination of the water supply. We have to start somewhere and it makes sense to start in urban areas, with Dhaka alone supporting about 10 percent of the population. We need to work on our water infrastructure that takes into account salinity intrusion, arsenic and faecal sludge contamination. What works in the capital city can then be replicated in other urban centres. Finally, we need to enforce our environmental laws that heavily penalise errant industries which continue to pollute our rivers and deprive us of natural water supply.

      "text": "Syed Waliullah's Tree Without Roots (1967) is a transcreation (a recreation in another language), rather than a literal translation, of his first novel Lal Shalu (1948). Waliullah made a number of changes to the text when translating it into English several years later. Certain characters and episodes are added or subtracted in the later version. Significant scenes from the original are missing, compelling us to ask why they were neglected. The transcreation also has an extended beginning and ending. Probably, Waliullah's long stay abroad by the time he translated Lal Shalu led to the changes that he made. Lal Shalu/Tree Without Roots tells the story of Majeed--a rootless man in search of a permanent place to live and prosper. He has long ago left his own village where there are \"too many people and not enough food.\" Too many young men are trained in the maktabs, and when they do not find employment in their own village, they branch out in search of work. Majeed becomes the muezzin of a makeshift mosque in the Garo Hills, but his life is lonely and difficult. He comes down from the hills in search of a better existence and seeks out the grave of an unknown person on the outskirts of Mahabbatnagar in Lal Shalu, renamed Mahabbatpur in Tree Without Roots, transforming it into a mazar (shrine). The mazar brings income for its keeper. People from Mahabbatpur and its surrounding villages come to pray at the mazar; they leave behind coins. Soon we find Majeed, who entered Mahabbatpur carrying only \"a kurta, a couple of old lungis, two thin towels and a small, much-thumbed Koran,\" owning a house, land, cows, and a storehouse for grain. He marries not once, but twice. Hardly ever does anyone question the mazar or Majeed's power. The landowner Khaleque is under his spell; and when Majeed perceives any threat to this rule, he expertly uproots it. It is not till much later, when Majeed remarries, that he meets a worthy opponent. His second wife, Jamila, and the hailstorm toward the end of the novel, collaborate to dislodge Majeed who has \"struck his roots deep and firm\" in Mahabbatpur. However Waliullah shows us, particularly in the transcreation, that forces like Majeed are not so easily overcome. Waliullah started writing Lal Shalu not long before the Partition when he was in Kolkata. The novel is said to have been influenced by a mausoleum that the author observed during his childhood in Mymensingh. He finished the novel and published it in 1948 after returning to Dhaka. While intellectual circles at the time were abuzz with debates and discussions on the ongoing political crisis and the Partition, Waliullah portrays the life of ordinary villagers of East Bengal. Would it be too far-fetched to make a connection between Waliullah and his contemporaries? Religious fervour had led to the separation of India and Pakistan, with the Western part of Pakistan taking up political/religious leadership over the East much in the way that Majeed assumes supremacy over the inhabitants of Mahabbatnagar. Waliullah, like other intellectuals of his time, was concerned; but being a creative writer, his expression is more subtle.          Tree Without Roots, on the other hand, was composed several years later, when Waliullah had been abroad for a while, spending time in New Delhi, Sydney, Jakarta and London, before finally settling in Paris. He translated Lal Shalu into English, from which his spouse, Anne-Marie Thibaud, translated it into French. In the course of the personal journeys that the author underwent, some elements of his novel changed. Among the significant changes in the later version is the omission of the chapter in which Majeed confronts the pir of Awalpur--his professional rival. Majeed, in Lal Shalu, is troubled by waning crowds at his mazar following the arrival of a pir in the neighbouring village, who is said to perform miracles. He goes to Awalpur taking great personal risk, for the pir is surrounded by his followers and goons. There he finds an assistant of the pir claiming that his master can stop time. Majeed judiciously proves this wrong, and returns to Mahabbatpur with the villagers at his tail. The next day, the villagers return to Awalpur with the intention of punishing the charlatan, but they are beaten by the pir's party. Their defeat in this clash, however, matters little to Majeed, for he has won back their loyalty. While the Awalpur pir is mentioned in Tree Without Roots, the latter's presence does not aggravate Majeed until Khaleque, his patron, shows interest in him. Khaleque had ignored the pir till Amena, his childless wife, instigated him to bring holy water from Awalpur. Amena's request reflects her lack of faith in Majeed's power--Majeed's first wife, Rahima, too is childless. However, rather than facing the pir, Majeed in the transcreation, concentrates on chastising Amena. Teaching Tree Without Roots has been an interesting experience. My students are enraged that the women in the novel must rely on charlatans rather than gynaecologists. Though access to doctors in remote villages was rare when Lal Shalu was written, especially for women, their rage is greatly justified. Rahima is blamed for the couple's barrenness--a blame she accepts. However, Jamila is also shown to be childless in the course of the novel, attesting Majeed's incapacity. Ultimately it is this \"weak female\" who is successful in shaking, if not uprooting, the tree that stands firm on its roots, which her male counterparts are unable to do. A young native of Mahabbatnagar, Akkas, launches a futile attack on Majeed's autocracy in Lal Shalu. The young man has escaped Majeed's influence through his temporary absence from Mahabbatnagar. Outside the village, he has encountered \"secular education\" and \"English education.\" He regards the maktabs of Mahabbatnagar as inadequate to train the children of his village, and dreams of setting up a secular school there. However, the village elders--Majeed's followers--are against Akkas, and Majeed too would have ignored him had not Akkas been on the brink of receiving government support for his dream institution. In reaction, the self-conferred religious leader calls a meeting at the mazar to discuss the issue. When Akkas arrives, he is rebuked for not having a beard, regarded as irreligious, and therefore as one whose motives are suspect. Majeed then directs the conversation to the necessity of a new mosque in the village instead of a school. Akkas exits the scene and we never hear of him again. The exclusion of Akkas in Tree Without Roots is shocking. His omission, along with the omission of Majeed's visit to Awalpur, marks a narrowing of the social dimension of the novel and a shift in focus to Majeed--the individual, for in the absence of these important episodes, we miss the chance to examine some pertinent social issues. The first is the prevalence of Majeed and his kind in the then East Pakistan. East Bengal, around the time of the Partition, seemed to have a combination of political, religious, economic and social conditions that encouraged the flourishing of conmen like Majeed and the Awalpur pir.  Tanvir Mokammel, in his 2001 film Lal Shalu, provides Majeed with a mazar-assistant who does not appear in Waliullah's original novel or in the transcreation. When discussing the film with my students, Mokammel explained the presence of this additional character: \"Figures like Majeed rarely existed alone,\" he said. In other words, the conditions of East Bengal then were favourable for the thriving of multiple Majeeds. Poverty coupled with the religious intensity/hypocrisy of the period would have given strength to such desperate men. Secondly, with the absence of Akkas in Tree Without Roots, we miss out on the debate regarding secular and religious education. Those interested in the topic may look up Abul Barkat's Political Economy of Madrassa Education in Bangladesh (2011). Akkas promotes \"English education\"--English being the language that would give learners access to the growing world of knowledge and science, and equip them to counter forces like Majeed. The question of education and its impact on our society as a whole is overlooked in Tree Without Roots. Had Waliullah lost touch with the reality of our region since migrating to France? Perhaps, because he either considered such issues irrelevant, or was induced by the pattern of the Western novel to focus on Majeed alone in Tree Without Roots. \nThough Waliullah's later novels Chander Amabasya (1964) and Kando Nadi Kando (1968) are set in Bengal, they are hailed as evidence of Waliullah's commitment to existentialism. The influence of Western thought and literature on Waliullah is clear. Lal Shalu too seems to have been re-written in the sixties keeping a Western audience in mind. The elaborate background establishing the poverty of Bengal at the start of Tree Without Roots is not needed for a Bengali audience. Waliullah was either trying to familiarise the Western audience with a situation unknown to them, or trying to catch their attention by feeding them preconceived information. However, this extended opening also serves to create sympathy for Majeed--a man led by gnawing hunger to a profession of tricking others. Majeed, the conman, is the protagonist of the novel. Throughout his exploits, we cling to the edge of our seats, waiting to see how he will overcome one challenge after another.\nThe constricting of the social dimension in the transcreation has already been noted. In his essay \"Third-World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism,\" Fredric Jameson claims that even the stories of private individuals in \"third world\" texts represent the \"embattled situation of the public third-world culture and society.\" This statement, though criticised for being too general, is applicable at least for Lal Shalu. The \"first world\" novel, Jameson further claims, is largely limited to the individual. In the case of Waliullah's work, the change in the title of the novel itself evinces a narrowing from the public to the private, for while \"lal shalu\" literally refers to the red cloth used in mausoleums, Majeed is the \"tree without roots\" of the title of the transcreation. Moreover, there is an additional section at the end focusing entirely on him.\nLal Shalu ends with a storm, perhaps intended to destroy Majeed when his fellow human beings fail to exact a suitable punishment. In Tree Without Roots, however, Waliullah seems dissatisfied with this supernatural ending. The transcreation presents a graver conclusion but a more resolute Majeed. Floodwaters follow the storm, engulfing the mazar, the mosque and Majeed's house, and the trickster must work out how to tackle this challenge as he has tackled many before. The answer for Majeed is to stay put. He must not, under any circumstances, abandon the mazar. Earlier that day, Majeed had visited his \"friend\" Khaleque only to receive a lukewarm response from him. The destitute peasants had also refused to seek consolation from him. Majeed knows that damage to the mazar can be repaired once the floodwaters recede, but he cannot mend the villagers' faith if he abandons the mazar at this time of distress. Leaving his wives under Khaleque's care, Majeed returns to the only place he can call home. Should he survive the flood, surely he will find a convincing excuse for why the mazar was not spared.\nThere is ample evidence to suggest that Waliullah had not lost touch with our region after all. We know of his attempts to raise support for Bangladesh among French intellectuals in 1971. We also find his keen realisation in Tree Without Roots, to return to the social interpretation of Waliullah's work, that duplicitous figures like Majeed are not so easily crushed, and we must continuously remain alert.\nDoes Waliullah project the downfall of West Pakistan in Lal Shalu? Does the storm symbolise our liberation struggle? Does he predict, in Tree Without Roots, that fundamentalist forces would soon return? It all depends on the reader's interpretation of the texts. Is Tree Without Roots an \"improved version of Lal Shalu\" as Serajul Islam Choudhury claims in his introduction to the transcreation? That too can be left to the reader's discretion.

Now the government wants to reclaim them with taxpayers' money.                     With most of the surviving 26 city canals under illegal occupation and clogged with solid wastes, the government has taken up a Tk 607-cr project for land acquisition and excavation of five canals to ease the capital's waterlogging problem. The five canals are Hazaribagh, Baishteki, Sangbadaik Colony, Begunbari and Manda Khal flowing through the two Dhaka city corporations. Over 82 percent of the money will be spent on acquisition of 30.5 acres of \"private land\" and the rest on compensation for structures, excavation and bank development. Excavation of a new canal, named Kurmitola, on 4.5-acre private land in the up and down stream of Hazaribagh Khal is also under the scheme. The Kurmitola canal will drain out the rainwater of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport and the old airport in Tejgaon.  The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) approved the draft proposal yesterday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina chaired the meeting. The local government ministry proposed the two-year scheme to be implemented by Dhaka Wasa by December next year. Asked about the justification for land acquisition to recover the canals, Wasa Managing Director Taqsem A Khan said parts of the canals were on government land. But they need to acquire some private land for the continuation of the canals. He declined to comment on their plan to reclaim the canals from grabbers. An official present at yesterday's Ecnec meeting said the PM questioned the need for land acquisition given the canals are on public land. In reply, a ministry official said they only made a proposal and that they would not spend the money if not required. After the meeting, Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal told reporters that the PM asked the authorities to demolish all structures to reclaim the canals. Project documents show the local government ministry argued for land acquisition, saying it was necessary for widening of the existing canals and excavation of a new one. The storm drainage system in the city is largely dependent on the five canals and their excavation will help ease the city's perennial waterlogging problem, it said. The planning commission recommended approving the project. Urban planners say an inadequate drainage system managed by seven authorities with little coordination and reckless destruction of wetlands and flood flow areas are the key reasons for Dhaka's waterlogging. They repeatedly warned against the continued destruction of the flood plains and wetland for \"mindless commercial gains\". The city's natural drainage system -- comprised of a network of 65 canals and four rivers, numerous water retention areas (ponds, ditches), extensive low-lying areas and flood flow zones -- has been consistently destroyed in the name of development, they said. Canals, rivers and water retention areas collect, carry and retain rainwater and are connected to each other as a drainage network. The low-lying wetlands and flood flow zones earmarked in the Detailed Area Plan (DAP) of Dhaka city no longer exist as those have been filled up, in many cases with government's approval, resulting in severe urban waterlogging.

Sadar upazila Sub-Assistant Agriculture Officer (SAAO) Milon Kumar Ghosh said he is in charge of Sadhuhati union and visits the area very often. Haripada hailed from Ashan Nagar village in the union, he said. \"Haripada discovered haridhan variety in 2006 and its cultivation spread quickly as it is very productive. Four thousand hectares of land had been brought under Haridhan cultivation from 2006 to 2009. This continued for a few years. In course of time, cultivation decreased due to scanty rainfall. This variety is suitable for lowlands where rainwater remains stagnant. If rainfall is sufficient farmers can grow up to 20 to 22 maunds per bigha,\" the SAAO said. This year, only 20 to 30 bighas of land had been brought under this variety, but its cultivation has increased in the lowlands of Cumilla, Sylhet, Rangamati and Khulna. This variety is under research at Bangladesh  Agriculture University, Mymensingh, he added.  Haripada's nephew Rupkumar Biswas said his maternal uncle passed away on July 6 in 2017.  \"Haripada thought about how he could get bumper production, and always picked up tall paddy plants from the field,\" Rupkumar said. \"One day, while working on plot BR-11, Haripada found a bunch of paddy which was stout and tall. Haripada took special care of it and facilitated its growth in a natural way. He sowed the seeds in separate places and measured the production. In this way he produced this variety and named it Haridhan. This is how its name and fame spread all around,\" Rupkumar said. Rupkumar added that he had cultivated Haridhan on 10 decimals of lowlands in 2017 and got bumper production. This year he has cultivated it on eight decimals and expects to get good production, he added. Mozibur Rahman of the same village said he has cultivated Haridhan on one bigha this year and expects to get bumper production. Many farmers are not cultivating Haridhan due to shortage of water, he added. Sadar Upazila Agriculture Officer Mofakkharul Islam said Haridhan is suitable for lowlands. Due to scanty rain the farmers are losing interest in this variety, he said, adding that it is available in flood-affected areas. Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Bangladesh Agriculture University, Mymensing, Prof Dr Mohammad Anwar Hossain said whether this variety will be recognised or not will be decided by the government after thorough research and experiment."

      "text": "Silos are being built to preserve food grain for a couple of years to meet the local demand as well as use it as backup to tackle any unwanted situation caused by natural calamities, she said. Hasina was addressing a programme in the city's Osmani Memorial Auditorium marking the distribution of Bangabandhu Jatiya Krishi Purashkar (Bangabandhu National Agriculture Award) for Bengali year 1423. Stressing the need for carrying out extensive research on agriculture, the PM said success in this sector would not be possible without research. She mentioned that Bangladeshi researchers have invented flood-, drought- and salinity-tolerant rice. The premier asked the authorities concerned to include agriculture and its practical aspects in curricula to encourage students to know about the cultivation system properly. \"After completing education, many people do not want to go to the farmland for agricultural works. The agriculture minister is here. I think special measures should be taken to make our students curious and sincere about agricultural works.... They should have a subject on agriculture alongside a practical one.\" she said. She described agriculture as the lifeline of Bangladesh's economy. \"We will gradually shift our dependence on industry, but not at the expense of agriculture as it will provide raw materials for industries apart from ensuring food security. \"Students should learn this [agricultural work]; there is nothing to be ashamed of if anyone plants a sapling with his own hands.\" She said the government wants children to acquire knowledge about agricultural works from their childhood. The government has been helping all concerned adopt modern technology in agriculture and also has been providing equipment to farmers, she told the programme. Stressing on setting up food-processing industries across the country, Hasina said Bangladesh has huge potentials in this sector as it can help earn foreign currency through export. She asked the authorities for protecting agricultural land from the onslaught of unplanned urbanisation and industrialisation. The PM said the government gives \"Bangabandhu Jatiya Krishi Purashkar\" during every Bengali New Year. The award is the highest state recognition for contributions to the development of the country's agriculture sector. Five gold, nine silver and 18 bronze medals in 10 categories are given to different organisations and individuals each year. The awardees received medals, cash and certificates from the prime minister. On behalf of the winners, Farhana Yasmin spoke at the programme. Chaired by Agriculture Minister Matia Chowdhury, the function was addressed, among others, by Fisheries and Livestock Minister Narayan Chandra Chanda."

      "text": "Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal yesterday released the data for November and December. In December food inflation increased slightly but as non-food inflation decreased, the overall inflation fell. Food inflation in December rose by 4 basis points and stood at 7.13 percent. But in November it fell by 53 basis points to 7.09 percent. Food inflation went down by 25 basis points to 7.62 percent in October after hitting a 38-month high of 7.87 percent in September. Food inflation declined for three months in a row but in December it increased as rice prices went up. Prices of many other essential commodities, including onion, also marked a rise stoking the inflation rate.  According to Trading Corporation of Bangladesh data, coarse rice sold for Tk 44 to Tk 46 per kilogramme in Dhaka yesterday -- a rise by 5.88 percent from a month back and by 23 percent from a year ago. In recent months, rice prices rose to record highs, reflecting dwindling supplies following flood-induced losses to the main boro crop, coupled with reduced production and imports in 2016. In September, coarse rice price in Dhaka city was Tk 52.54 a kg in contrast to Tk 34.62 a year earlier. In August 2014, food inflation was 7.67 percent and gradually decreased to below 4 percent. But from January last year, it started to creep up to more than 6 percent, crossing the 7 percent mark in May. It remained above 7 percent in the following five months except June. According to BBS data, food inflation in rural areas rose by only 1 basis point to stand at 7.08 percent. However, in urban areas inflation increased by 7 basis points to 7.22 percent. When asked whether the BBS data reflected the real picture of the rise in food prices, Kamal said the BBS conducted the survey and prepared the inflation data on the basis of living index throughout the country. The prices of rice and onion increased and this reflected in the overall index. The minister said, from October to December, general inflation was 5.93 percent whereas it was 5.32 percent in the same period last year. Non-food inflation went down by 25 basis points to 3.85 percent in December from 4.10 percent a month ago, according to the BBS data. But in November, non-food inflation went up by 49 basis points compared to that in October. Non-food inflation went up by 17 basis points to 3.61 percent in October from 3.44 percent a month ago, according to the BBS data. Non-food inflation in December fell in both rural and urban areas. Inflation decelerated to 5.44 percent in the last fiscal year, aided by prudent monetary management and weak aggregate demand. The government has set the inflation target at 5.5 percent for fiscal 2017-18.   "

The ground failure through which soil loses strength and stiffness in response to, for example, an earthquake is known as soil liquefaction. In Dhaka city, numerous studies and press reports have shown how unscrupulous real estate companies and influential individuals continue to encroach on the flood flow zones, wetlands and low lands. They fill up these lands and construct buildings there. Many structures were built just above sand and solid waste, making them very susceptible to soil liquefaction in the event of an earthquake. Dhaka might face a catastrophe too if RAJUK doesn't reclaim the illegally grabbed lands and put into place a proper land use system.   Jahidul Islam Nahid, University of Dhaka"

A 50-year-old concrete bridge on Hangarkul canal in Satkania upazila of Chittagong remains in an awful condition for over a year, reports our correspondent Arun Bikash Dey. Locals said the 40-foot-long concrete bridge became vulnerable due to lack of renovation for long and it developed a large hole in the middle a year ago, making it difficult for vehicles and pedestrians to pass. Hundreds of residents of nearby Hangarkul, Patiyakhali and Dhemsha villages use the bridge that connects the upazila headquarters and a few local markets. Besides, students of two primary schools, a high school and a girls' madrasa use the bridge to go to and from the institutions. \"My friend fell off a rickshaw while we were crossing the bridge. However, she was lucky enough not to fall into the canal through the big hole,\" said Tasfia Binte Rashid, a student of Daimar Khil Mahila Dakhil Madrasa. The bridge has turned too risky for users, especially during the night, Md Mostak, an advocate's clerk, said, adding that they submitted an application to the local union parishad (UP) chairman in this regard over six months ago, but no initiative has been taken yet. Dakkhin Dhemsha UP Chairman Ridwan Uddin said, \"After receiving the application, I informed Satkania upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) and the local lawmaker of the matter and asked for fund to reconstruct the bridge.\" UNO Mobarak Hossain said he will look into the matter. Our Jhenidah Correspondent reports: People of 25 villages including Bannadul, Parnanduali, Barashia, Belnagar, Ramnagar, Tagorbari and Kushundia in Magura Sadar upazila are badly suffering as the newly constructed bridge over the Nabaganga river is lying unused due to not having approach roads on both sides. Magura Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) built the 570-foot-long bridge over the river about seven months ago at a cost of Tk 10.67 crore. In December 2016, LGED floated a tender for the purpose and Tarikul Islam, owner of Islam Traders of Jessore, was awarded the work order. The construction of the bridge was completed in December last year, but the approach roads are yet to be built. Six motorcyclists met accidents while crossing the bridge recently, said trader Sumon Sarkar. Contractor Tarikul Islam said construction of the approach roads was hampered due to heavy rain but it will be completed soon. The remaining work is being hampered due to heavy rain and shortage of labourers, Magura LGED Executive Engineer Harunur Rashid said, adding that he directed the contractor concerned to complete the work soon. Our Lalmonirhat Correspondent reports: Thousands of people of four villages in Kaliganj upazila of the district have been suffering a lot since the lone bridge over Ghanoshyam canal on Tushbhandar-Aminganj road collapsed due to strong current during last year's flood. The people of Ghanoshyam, Uttar Ghanoshyam, Dullarpara and Amin Bazar villages under Tushbhandar union in the upazila have to travel an additional five kilometres to reach the upazila headquarters and local union parishad (UP) office as the only alternative. Nazrul Islam, 58, of Ghanoshyam village said they appealed to the authorities concerned to repair the bridge several times, but to no effect. Kaliganj Upazila Parishad Chairman Mahbubuzzaman Ahmed said after visiting the area he sent a letter to Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) authorities to build a new bridge or repair the older one to ensure easy communication of the villagers. Kaliganj Upazila LGED Engineer Parvez Newaz Khan said he visited the area and informed his higher officials of the matter. A new bridge will be built there soon, he said.  Our Mymensingh Correspondent adds: A wooden bridge constructed with local initiative in Kalmakanda upazila of Netrakona was washed away by floodwater on July 4, putting thousands of people in the remote area into serious trouble. \"With the help of local elite and Kharnoi Union Parishad Chairman Obaidul Haque, we built the 150-foot-long and seven-foot-wide wooden bridge on the Denki river in Kalmakanda's Ranigaon, at a cost of Tk 4.50 lakh three months ago and named it 'Muktijuddha Setu',\" said freedom fighter Md Harun-or-Rashid, who led the work. The bridge collapse has caused problem for the people of some 12 villages who use Kalmakanda-Ranigaon road to reach their destinations including the upazila headquarters, the only way to connect with Netrakona and other parts of the country, said Md Saiful Islam, member of Awami League's Kalmakanda upazila unit. There are some 10 educational institutions including primary and high schools and a college on both sides of the river and the students have to cross the river by boat for attending their classes, said Hafizur Rahman Ansari, headmaster of Borodal Government Primary School. Local farmers and fishermen said they are facing problem to carry their produces to market due to poor communication system. The locals have urged for construction of a concrete bridge on the river. Upazila Nirbahi Officer Arifuzzaman said he has informed the higher authorities of the matter."

Students of many other flood-affected primary schools have to go to school on small boats at risk of their lives for the last few days in the two districts. Manoranjan Das, guardian of a student at Nischintapur Government Primary School in Juri upazila of Moulvibazar, said they feel afraid when their kids go to school on boats amid risk. If a road is built near the school, most of the students and teachers would be able to go to school easily. \"We feel more worried when see small kids row the boats themselves,\" he added. Bibekananda Das, assistant teacher of the school, told this correspondent that they started classes on June 19 after a long closure. They are teaching only Class V students as special preparation for those who will sit for the PSC examinations, adding that most of them come to the school on small boats. Popi Begum, a student at Gourcharon Government Primary School in Kulaura upazila of Moulvibazar, said they feel afraid when the boats reach the middle of the haor and face the waves. Kulomohon Das, headmaster of Shahpur Government Primary School in Juri upazila, said their school building is under five to six feet of water, so they had to close it. It will take some more time to resume classes fully, he added. Md Abdul Kadir, president of Modongouri Government Primary School managing committee in the same upazila, said they feel anxious as the kids cross the water in boats amid risk. Azizur Rahman, Chairman of Bhuksimul Union Parishad under Kulaura upazila in Moulvibazar, said most of the area is under water. Upazila administration authorities suspended classes in Modongouri, Jabda, Muktajipur and Kalesha Government Primary Schools as they are under water. Md Bayzid Khan, Moulvibazar district primary education officer, told this correspondent that 59 primary schools were closed as the classrooms are under water, while the grounds of 56 schools are submerged. Most of the students are coming to classes on boats, he added. Md Obaidullah, Sylhet district primary education officer, told this correspondent that 51 primary schools have been closed, adding that 162 schools are open, but attendance is very poor. Faruqee Mahmud Chowdhury, president of Susasoner Jonno Nagorik, Sylhet chapter, said the communication system in the haor areas turns very bad every year during the rainy season as strong waves hamper normal movement, making boat journey highly risky for the children. Many children drown every year while going to school during the rainy season, he said, adding that parents prefer not to send their children to school fearing the high risk involved in their journey. We have suggested to the government to introduce water bus services for safe movement of students, which will also reduce dropout rate at the schools, he added."

The draft would be placed for approval at tomorrow's National Economic Council meeting chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. At least 80 projects have been selected for implementation.  Of them, 65 would be infrastructure projects and 15 others would aim at enhancing institutional capacity, efficiency and research. A planning ministry official said they selected these projects from 133 priority projects of various ministries and divisions. The General Economics Division (GED) of the ministry has prepared the draft with the assistance of the Dutch government and the World Bank. GED member Shamsul Alam said, \"We are going to take up the long-term plan to tackle the adverse impact of climate change.\" He said they had 26 studies done by local experts and prepared the plan in consultation with different stakeholders. It took them three and a half years.  Alam added that they had sent the list of the projects to the WB and its experts reviewed and endorsed them. He also said Bangladesh had been experiencing the adverse impact of climate change. Every year, 50,000 families become landless due to the adverse impact, he added. According to a planning ministry document, the required fund for the 80 projects would come from the government, Green Climate Fund, development partners, foreign direct investment and the private sector. At present, the government spends 0.8 percent of the GDP for Delta management projects and programmes. To implement the plan, two percent of the GDP would be required. Bangladesh is likely to get $2 billion assistance from Green Climate Fund every year. Besides, about 0.5 percent from the private sector's annual income could be added to the Delta Plan fund. Coastal, Varendra (Barind) and drought-prone, haor and flood-prone, Chittagong Hill Tracts, riverine and urban are the six areas to be given priority by the Delta Plan. Due to climate change, the country's agricultural production may be seriously affected. The production of paddy and wheat may decrease by 17 percent and 61 percent. About 70 percent areas in 16 districts, where poverty rate is very high, are most vulnerable to natural disasters, the planning ministry document mentioned. To execute the Delta Plan 2100, a high-level Delta Governance Council led by the prime minister would be formed. The planning minister would be its vice-president. The council would make decisions and give directives for implementing the plan. Besides, a project selection committee, led by a GED member, would be constituted. The secretaries of the ministries related to the Delta Plan would be committee members, who would select projects and programmes. The committee would also monitor implementation of the projects and programmes."

Consumption of hard drinks in Bangladesh is highly regulated whereas it is widely consumed in developed countries - another factor that offers immense opportunities for the sector to grow, he told The Daily Star in an interview last week. The CSD manufacturers in Bangladesh are burdened with a whopping 43.75 percent value-added tax and supplementary duty, which is much lower in other Saarc nations. Such taxes hover around 35.3 percent in India, 29.2 percent in Sri Lanka, 24.2 percent in Nepal and 30 percent in Bhutan, according to Chowdhury. The government should lower the existing 25 percent supplementary duty on the CSD, which was 15 percent four to five years ago, he said. In the last six years, the CSD manufacturers have invested around Tk 4,000 crore in the industry, he said. \"If the taxes are cut, the sales of soft drinks will increase manifold, more jobs will be created and more new investment will be made.\" The sector has grown at 7-8 percent annually in the last five years whereas Transcom Beverages has grown more than 18 times since its inception in 2000, he said. \"PepsiCo is now the strong CSD market leader in Bangladesh with a huge gap in market share with its competitors,\" said Chowdhury, who has 28 years of experience in the fast moving consumer goods industry. A majority of the remittance recipients and families of garment workers live in rural areas, where soft drinks consumption is growing very fast, he said. \"We are basically involved in the carbonated soft drinks business and water segment.\" \"The list of our products include Pepsi, 7 Up, Mirinda, Mountain Dew, Slice, Pepsi Diet, Pepsi Black, 7 Up Lite and Aquafina. PepsiCo now occupies over 50 percent market share in the CSD clear category thanks mainly to the champion brand 7 Up.\" 7 Up has been adjudged the most loved brand and the Best Beverage Brand in Bangladesh for the last eight years by Bangladesh Brand Forum. Transcom Beverages became the best bottler in the world and won the International Bottler of the Year award twice -- in 2009 and 2016. In the Indian region, Transcom Beverages won the Best Bottler of the Year award six times. \"Our plants in Dhaka and Chattogram have also won Best Plant awards twice.\" Chowdhury said Transcom Beverages has a special place in the world as a marketer of Pepsi-branded soft drinks. Transcom Beverages has so far invested close to $180 million in the industry, said Chowdhury, who is one of the global recipients of the PepsiCo President's Ring of Honor award for his performance in 2010. This is the highest award for a person in the soft drinks industry given by PepsiCo among its operations in the globe. Transcom Beverages is also a top taxpayer in the country, he said. It won the award as the highest taxpayer company in fiscal 2014-15 and 2016-17 in the food and allied category and achieved \"AAA\" credit rating from 2012 to 2017. \"All these were possible because of the continuous support and guidance of Transcom Group's Chairman Latifur Rahman, who has also been awarded as one of the top taxpayers of the country for years,\" he said. \"Latifur Rahman along with his Transcom Group is widely respected in Bangladesh for maintaining business ethics, which has paid off for Transcom Beverages.\" The soft drinks industry entered Bangladesh with returnable glass bottles when there were only Pepsi and Coca-Cola, he said. It flourished after the introduction of soft drinks in plastic bottles in the early 2000s, said the veteran marketer, who started his career with Unilever and worked in different capacities, including regional sales manager and brand manager. Transcom Beverages has three plants: two in Dhaka and one in Chattogram, said Chowdhury, who was the sales director of Reckitt Benckiser before joining Transcom Beverages as general manager for sales and marketing. \"Despite being a franchise, we are self-sufficient in many cases. We have our own preform manufacturing plant, shrink wrapping machine, filling machine and carbon dioxide plant.\" \"We have to bring in the concentrate from the mother organisation. Our main source is Singapore and one of the main hubs is Ireland.\" Transcom Beverages always believed in giving back to the society as the company strictly follows its motto \"Performance with Purpose\", said Chowdhury, who hails from Chattogram. The company regularly provides scholarships to meritorious students among the children of its employees. \"We have also extended funds among the Rohingyas through Transcom Group's Faraaz Hossain Foundation. We have also been there for the victims of the recent flood in the country.\"   shoyeb@thedailystar.net\n"

The case was filed with Chittagong Kotwali Police Station under Section 57 (2) of Information and Communication Technology Act and Section 15 (3) of Special Power Act last night around 10:45pm, our Chittagong correspondent reports quoting Md Mohsin, officer-in-charge of the police station. Jakaria Dastagir, general secretary of Chittagong Metropolitan unit of Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), filed the case accusing Amir Khasru of attempting to create anarchy in the country. Earlier last night, a phone conversation allegedly between Khasru and a  BNP activist was leaked, in which the BNP leader was heard giving instruction to infiltrate the ongoing nationwide student protests demanding safe roads with the party men. In the case statement, the plaintiff said Amir Khasru was hatching a conspiracy to make the country unstable and instigate anarchy by carrying out subversive activities as he was heard giving instruction through an electronic device in this regard. Students of schools and colleges have been staging demonstrations across the country demanding safety on roads for seven days since July 29 when two college students were killed and several others were injured in a tragic road accident on Airport Road in Dhaka's Kurmitola area."

      "text": "Two people were arrested on charges of rape in separate incidents in Sylhet today. At Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital, an intern doctor was arrested for allegedly raping a patient's attendant. The arrestee, Makam-e-Mahmud of Muktagacha area in Mymensingh, was an intern doctor on at Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) ward of the hospital. The victim's family filed a case with Kotwali Police Station after learning about the incident, reports our local correspondent quoting Golam Kawsar Dastagir, assistant commissioner of police in Sylhet. Around 1:00am last night, Mahmud called the victim to the doctor's room while she was attending her grandmother, a patient at the hospital, and raped her there, Kawsar said citing from the case statement. \"After reviewing video footage and taking statements of both the parties, we have found the intern doctor guilty and handed him over to the police,\" said Dr Debapada Roy, deputy director of the hospital. The victim is currently receiving treatment at the one-stop crisis centre of the hospital. In Zakiganj upazila, an imam of a mosque was arrested for allegedly raping a ten-year-old girl at Kaliganj area on Sunday night. The arrestee is Hasan Ahmed, 25, of Barathakuri union of the upazila and an imam of Hajarichak Paschimpara Natun Panjeganja Mosque in Kaliganj area. The victim, a class four student of Kalakuta Government Primary School, went missing while returning from her school on Sunday. After hours of searching, the girl was finally rescued from a mosque that night, reports our local correspondent quoting Habibur Rahman Hawladar, officer-in-charge of Zakiganj Police. She was found tied up with ropes and hidden under a couch, the OC said, adding the imam was held in this connection. The victim's father filed a case against the imam with Zakiganj Police station today, the police official also said. After being produced before a Senior Judicial Magistrate's court in Sylhet, Hasan today confessed that he lured the girl inside the mosque, made her drink some juice mixed with sleeping pills and then raped her on Sunday afternoon. The victim is undergoing treatment at the One-stop-Crisis Centre (OCC) of MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital, the OC said. Her physical condition is now stable, he added."

      "text": "BNP leaders and activists were dispersed by law enforcers at different places as they gathered to greet party chief Khaleda Zia who was heading for Sylhet yesterday, just three days before a court is set to deliver verdict in a graft case against her. A group of people chanted slogans in favour of the ruling Awami League and showed shoes and sandals when Khaleda's motorcade was crossing Narsingdi's Bhelanagr area around 11:20am. However, a huge number of BNP men could stand on roadsides in some places, where they didn't face police obstructions, and chanted slogans welcoming the party chairperson. Their big gatherings were seen in Bhairab, Habiganj and Sylhet. Law enforcers in large numbers were also deployed at important points on Dhaka-Sylhet highway. Police allegedly chased away BNP leaders and activists in Narayanganj, Narsingdi and Nabiganj of Habiganj. They detained a number of the party men, including four in Narayanganj, 12 in Kararchar area of Narsingdi, who tried to take to the streets to greet their party chief. Talking to reporters before Khaleda's tour began, BNP Standing Committee Member Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said their chairperson was going to Sylhet only to offer Fateha at the shrines of two great saints. Replying to a query, he said Khaleda is not going to launch from Sylhet her party's campaign for the next election. The tour came after the Special Court-5 in Dhaka fixed February 8 for delivering the verdict in the Zia Orphanage Trust graft case filed against Khaleda and five others. Earlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at a rally in Sylhet sought vote for \"boat\", the electoral symbol of the Awami League, beginning her polls campaign. BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's security team clears way for her car through a crowd of activists and supporters in Kishoreganj as she heads for Sylhet yesterday. Photo courtesy: BNP\n\n Khaleda arrived at Sylhet Circuit House around 4:30pm and took   rest for a while. She then started    for the shrine of Hazrat Shahjalal (RA). She reached the famous shrine around 6:00pm and offered Fateha and Munajat. On her way, she was greeted by hundreds of her supporters standing on roadsides. Later, the BNP chief went to the shrine of Hazrat Shah Paran (RA) at Khadimnagar, nearly 7km away from the city, around 7:20pm. After offering Fateha and Munajat, she returned to Sylhet Circuit House. Khaleda last visited Sylhet on October 4, 2013 and addressed a rally of BNP-led 20-party alliance there. Abdur Razzak, inspector (investigation) of Sadar Model Police in Narayanganj, said advocate Sakhawat Hossain Khan, vice     president of Narayanganj city BNP; advocate Anwar Prodan, former  entertainment affairs secretary of District Bar Association, and Moinuddin Reza, co-organising secretary of Narayanganj Lawyers Forum, were detained in Signboard area around 10:30am. They were arrested in a case under the Explosive Substances Act, our Narayanganj correspondent reported. Our Narsingdi correspondent added that police detained local BNP unit's international affairs secretary Sanaullah Mia and 12 others. Sanaullah was later released. At least 123 BNP-Jamaat leaders and activists were arrested from Sunday night to early yesterday. Of them, 69 were arrested in Jhenidah, 17 in Chandpur, 12 in Satkhira, seven in Jessore, two in Faridpur, eight in Bogra, four in Narayanganj and three in Mymensingh."

Metropolitan Magistrate Muhammad Fahd Bin Amin Chowdhury passed the order upon an elaborate hearing on the remand prayer. In the remand prayer, Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Inspector Subrata Kumar Saha, also the investigation officer of the case, told the court that one of the accused in the case arrested earlier gave a confessional statement where he revealed that the former lawmaker gave money for killing the victim. \"So Tripti needs to be remanded to find out vital clues about the killing,\" he said. On the other hand, Tripti's lawyer Advocate Masud Ahmed Talukder told the court that his client on May 29 last year got an ad-interim bail from the High Court that asked law enforcement agencies not to arrest Tripti without any arrest warrant from any court. The arrest by the CID was a gross-violation of the HC order, he said.      After hearing both the sides' argument, the magistrate fixed August 13 for hearing on the remand prayer in presence of Tripti and ordered to send him to jail. CID arrested Tripti from his Banani residence in the capital yesterday. On September 23, 2006, three unidentified youths shot Prof Aftab, a senior professor of political science department at Dhaka University (DU), after entering his Fuller Road residence on DU campus. He was rushed to Samorita Hospital with two bullet wounds and was later transferred to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH), where he succumbed to his injuries four days later."

      "text": "Girl's dropout rate is higher than that of boys, whose 33.43 percent discontinued school last year, says the report. However, the overall dropout at secondary level has gradually been declining since 2008 when the rate was a staggering 61.38 percent. The rate came down to 37.81 percent last year from 38.3 percent the previous year. The Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics (Banbeis) prepared the draft report styled \"Bangladesh Education Statistics-2017\" and organised a dissemination workshop for its stakeholders at its office yesterday. \"Poverty is a major reason behind the dropout of girls. Just 10 years ago, we used to see little girls being compelled to work as domestic helps to survive. But the situation has changed,\" said Education Minister Nurul Islam Nahid while speaking at the programme. He added guardians are now very conscious and the government has also been providing necessary support. \"Free textbooks and stipend programmes from primary to higher education -- this is how we are extending our support. Around 2.3 crore students now get the stipends,\" the minister added. Md Fashiullah, director of Banbeis, held both early marriage and poverty accountable for girl's dropout. The draft report says dropout rate at higher secondary level (Class 11-12) was 19.89 percent last year. The Banbeis collected data online from all 41,461 post-primary education institutions across the country from September 20 to October 20 last year to prepare the report. The total number of students at these institutions is around 1.87 crore, says the report, adding, the number of institutions from primary to university is 1.74 lakh. However, the report does not have any information on the Qawmi madrasas. The Banbeis director said there are around 15 lakh students at the Qawmi madrasas. The report also portrays a grim picture of the teacher-student ratio. There was one teacher for 42 students in secondary schools last year. The country still remains far from achieving the minimum international standard teacher-student ratio at this level. The international standard teacher-student ratio is 1:30. Moreover, the National Education Policy, 2010 targets to achieve this ratio at secondary level by this year. According to the report, teacher-student ratio was 1:42 in 2016 1:41 in 2015, 1:39 in 2014, 1:37 in 2013 and 1:36 in 2012. Education ministry officials said the teacher-student ratio is an indicator of quality of education. The quality falls in crowded classrooms where it is difficult for students to take lessons and teachers also get to spend less time on individual students, they said. The number of students in the schools is increasing every year and the authorities are struggling to provide them with required number of teachers, they added. The draft report shows that 71.66 percent secondary schools have trained teachers and 86.65 percent schools have computer facilities. It also says around 80 percent schools have internet connections. The report also shows that the number of teachers at post-primary level in Bangladesh is 561,962 with more than 22 percent of them being female. Around 45 percent or 18,638 education institutions are prone to disasters like flood, cyclone, landslide, river erosion and surge, the report adds."

Then I started rearing ducks. With the earning from selling eggs and ducks, now I am maintaining our six-member family. My children also help me in the farm,\" said Popy Begum, 38, a housewife of Baradal village. Md Kamruzzaman, chairman of Tahirpur Upazila Parishad, said, \"After losing crops during last year's floods, many people in haor areas are going to different areas in search of work. However, some villagers have found means of livelihood in duck farming.\"  Duck farming bears good prospect for people in haor areas, said Bindu Talukder, member-secretary of Haor Bachao, Sunamganj Bachao Andolon."

      "text": "Unless you've been living under a rock for the past couple decades, you know very well about the phenomenal takeover by various forms of social media. Now, of these number of online platforms, this article sheds light on Instagram and its way of revealing more than just your pictures. Instagram accounts tell us more about someone's personality AND their mental health than you thought. All you have to do, is just look closely. First-off, let's start with the gym freaks. These usually consist of neverending stream of videos of the person doing pushups, lifting weights and the like, often accompanied by triggering hashtags like \"#doyouevenliftbro\" seeing which, motivates you to join the gym even less. These people often try to spice things up by bringing variation to their stream with food pictures of their \"healthy\" diet. All the while highlighting the fact that they are most often narcissists. Some of the more poetic kind strive to share their deep thoughts through pictures of the sky, coupled with even deeper captions that have nothing to do with the picture itself. Now, being quite the admirer of nature, I don't really mind. However, there comes a tipping point when the pictures start looking all the same and a mere glance at the sky gives you PTSD as a result of flashbacks of their Instagram feeds. Speaking of depth, here comes the book-grammers. These consist of photos of books placed aesthetically, often beside an even more aesthetic cup of coffee accompanied by an even more aesthetic caption. I admire the accounts which pull this off well mostly because of their informative nature, as I refer to them for my reading-list. However this is a given, as it only applies if the account owners are indeed as intellectual and bookish as they seem on social media. Focusing on the mental states now, some Instagrammers post blurry and grainy pictures of themselves which I believe is supposed to leave us as oblivious as they are with their ownlives. On a serious note however, people who use B&W filters the most are often found to be more depressed than people who don't. Here's one I'm particularly annoyed by. These accounts consist of people posting pictures of their significant others to such an uncontrollable extent that you often start getting confused as to who the account really belongs to. If this wasn't enough to highlight possible insecurities in their relationships, the pictures are often coupled with overpossesive captions which further confirm the notion. Last but not the least, we have the Instagram models, people who are basically only famous on Instagram. Their minimal 10K followers and Instagram feeds filled with pictures of them posing with various kinds of tea are indicators of their kind. They are often well-dressed and flood their feed with singles and often look older than their actual age. All in all, these predictions arent applicable for all accounts of the aforementioned kinds, rather stand true for the few that overdo it, except for doggo accounts which can never be overdone. In conclusion, to avoid any of this drama go to your Instagram account and delete it.

      "text": "A skilled storyteller in his own right, Humayun Ahmed's narrative prowess was eminent in his films. During the 90s when rampant commercialisation resulted in over-glammed, action-packed, blockbuster-style cinema led by testosterone-fuelled heroes, Ahmed's films exhibited a knack for well-rounded and socially relevant narratives. Starting from his first movie to his last, Ahmed threaded together tales of love, political self-determination, and heroism--all of which have a complex relation with gender and masculinity. He explored these concepts through his memorable characters, who still remain favourites with Bengali film audiences from the 90s onward. What is remarkable about Ahmed's films is that his idea of people was not static--his characters became more fluid and complex as time went by. Looking at three of Humayun Ahmed's films from three different stages of his career, it becomes more and more evident that the writer's attempt at understanding the male character beyond its traditional roles evolved with time. Initially, Ahmed displayed a classic understanding of male characters. In his first movie, Aguner Poroshmoni (1995), he explored masculinity in a traditional framework--in which men who exhibit physical strength, bravery, aggression, and emotional toughness towards violence are on top of the gender hierarchy. These attributes are idealised for male characters who are shown to dominate others. In that way, masculinity of this film unfolds in two cases: first as the conditions of war itself, and second, as the heroic freedom fighter protagonist. The film tells the story of a middle-class family stuck in Dhaka during the Liberation War of 1971. Ahmed depicts war almost solely as a project of exploitation of men by men. Apart from domestic roles, women are not involved in war, and strikingly, neither are they portrayed as victims. Scenes of war-struck Dhaka are constructed as homosocial spaces, be it the military, the guerrilla resistance, the tea-stall, or the office. War only has space for men who emit leadership and extroversion akin to the male protagonist, Bodi, played by Asaduzzaman Noor. And those who exhibit \"weak\" attributes such as fumbling, pleading, fear, are either victims of intimidation or are killed in the film. The family gives temporary refuge to freedom fighter Bodi, who is constructed as the ideal man--righteous and courageous. He is desirable in all senses, he is kind to animals, he is respectful to women, he doesn't discriminate along class lines, he takes care of his mother and sister, and also fights for his country. Bodi exhibits hegemonic masculinity-- personality traits that are rewarded by social institutions; other men who do not exhibit such alpha-male behaviour are measured as inferior in relation to characters like Bodi. These roles become further defined when the character is contrasted with that of Ratri's, the female protagonist, played by Bipasha Hayat, who becomes infatuated with Noor's character. Their developing romance dally around gendered behaviour. Ratri embodies the soft-imagination of the war while Bodi is the hard-imagination--he has a material impact in changing the conditions of war but Ratri's scope within the war is limited to keeping up the spirit of liberation through songs and poetry. Ratri feels helpless in the conditions of war while Bodi feels purposeful. Her character is constructed as fragile, unable to confront loss, experiencing frequent nightmares, and breaking into fits. This construction implies that men's lives are meaningful and women's purpose is to ensure that these men never lose sight of that meaning. However, Ahmed's understanding of masculinity was more nuanced in his mid-career film, Shyamol Chhaya (2005), where he created the stereotypical hero in Humayun Faridi and the not-so-stereotypical-hero in Shaon. Faridi plays a freedom fighter akin to Aguner Poroshmoni's Bodi, with similar high-spirited patriotism and nonchalant chivalry. Shaon's character, Asha, on the other hand, is a playful newly married woman who is unable to romance her husband because of her evil mother-in-law. While Faridi does play the obvious war hero, Asha is also seen interacting with conditions of war in her own naive ways. Her first brush with war is when a Razakar attempts to capture her but she actively resists. When other passengers in the boat capture the Razakar and keep him hostage, Asha visits him in private and threatens him with a razor blade, \"Dei gola ta kaitta (Shall I slit your throat)?\" The whole film is laced with Asha's protests, be it refusing to remove her shankha when the Muslim boat-owner orders her to, or sitting close to her husband when her mother-in-law asks her not to, or singing when her husband tells her not to. Asha's final protest was joining the troupe of freedom fighters led by Faridi's character. However, Faridi's character, the freedom fighter leader, who exhibits hegemonic masculinity in this story, falls short in winning the audience's sympathy. A battle ensues at the end of the film and though the obvious outcome would have been a heroic act by one of the male characters, it is Asha who is hit by a bullet while distracting the Pakistani Army. With this ending, Ahmed decides to bring a bit more complexity to stereotypical roles of women during wartime. Moreover, he writes other male characters that do not fit the macho mask. The dedicated Maulana played by Riaz, obsessively cares for his pregnant wife, bringing her fruits, making sure she's not sick, at a time of war. The Hindu man, Gourango, played by Swadhin, is controlled by his toxic mother who dislikes Gourango's wife, Asha. The Bengali-German engineer, played by Shimul, is struggling with the loss of his family and refuses to take part in battle. These characters' wars are not in the physical battle field but in the social realms, a realm which is not separate from war-struck consequentiality. Maulauna's fight is in remaining true to God in a war that is between Islamicised Pakistan and secular Bangladesh. Yet, it is Maulauna who convinces the boat owner to allow Hindu passengers to remain on the boat. By the end of the film, we see him coming to terms with the liberation struggle and opine that \"Pakistan Military are oppressors\". Gourango, too, overcomes his dependency on his mother, and chooses to join his wife in battle. Shimul's character resolves his internal conflict by becoming more compassionate. He quotes Shakespeare's Caesar, \"cowards die many times before their death\" and decides to join the Muktibahini. But Faridi's character advises, \"shobai ki shob kichu pare? Apni e toh bolsen. (Everything is not for everyone, as you said so),\" indicating that to be a man, one does not have to throw grenades at the enemy--Shimul's job as an engineer is equally important. His emotional torment at the loss of his family does not make his life less purposeful. These avenues as a whole redefine what it must mean to be a man during a time of crisis, and thankfully, Ahmed's Shyamol Chhaya provides more than one option. In his last film, Ghetuputra Komola (Pleasure Boy Komola) (2012), Ahmed pushes the lid with masculinity by providing us a character in Zahir/Komola, who is perceived as gender fluid and because of such fluidity, is vulnerable to gendered violence. The film opens with an explanation of ghetu tradition--a form of folk performance art where a young boy dresses as a girl to sing and dance. Set in colonial Bengal, Komola, Zahir's ghetu avatar, is hired by a zamindar, played by Tareque Anam, for the duration of the flood season. His perceived gender fluidity makes him a victim of the zamindar's sexual aggression. Ghetuputra Komola blurs the dichotomy that what is male is absolutely not female. It turns the binary on its head--Zahir is perceived as weak in his female avatar, similar to how women are perceived as vulnerable by the dictates of patriarchy. Through this film, Ahmed appears as a staunch critique of the power structures that enable gendered violence. The homosexual relation between the zamindar and Komola is readily accepted due to his perceived femininity. All members of the zamindar house and even Komola's troupe and family, remain silent when he cries for help. Even if someone raises a complaint, like the zamindar's wife did at the very beginning, they are silenced immediately by the zamindar who has the potential to cause physical and societal harm to people under him. While Komola continues being sexually exploited throughout the film, only one voice, that of the zamindar's daughter, reminds us that this is indeed gendered injustice. She keeps asking, \"Komola ki chele naki meye (Is Komola a girl or a boy)?\" Komola's perceived gender fluidity is also depicted as threatening to existing conventions. The zamindar's servants feel repulsion towards him which manifests through bodily resistance. The head servant washes her hand every time she comes in contact with him in order to purify herself.  The zamindar's wife prohibits Komola from touching her make-up box. She also orders her daughter not to play with the boy in fear of getting \"corrupted\". Zahir, too, internalises his \"abnormality\" and asks the zamindar's court artist, \"Apni ki amake ghreena koren (Are you disgusted of me)?\" Zahir's question quietly reminds the audience that he is but a kid suffering violence due to social prejudices. In classic Humayun Ahmed-style, the volatile perception of gender is realised through the intricate layers of Zahir/Komola's pathos. From his first movie to his last, Humayun Ahmed displayed a gradual progression in his understating of human conditions, especially relating to masculinity. With time, his characters became more complex, teaching his audience that men do not function in one certain way. The same cannot be said about his female characters, but that is for another day. For now, it is worth appreciating the characters who have transcended the burden of masculinity. Characters that subtly or boldly challenge their existing circumstances and inspire many more young men to shed the burden of being the hero-types.

So how do we deal with these moments? Like the wise Meredith Grey once said, we love hitting ourselves with the hammer and this right here is a profound example. We keep forgetting that life cannot be graded and fall into the toxic allure of comparisons. Social media is one vital determinant in controlling our confidence bars. These days the catalysis has been enhanced more as people your age are getting promotions, graduating or tying the knot. It's a flood of congratulations out there and you are not receiving any of that which can cause your mood to take a nosedive. What we have to remember is that people only exhibit the best aspects of their lives on social media; their highlight reels. We tend to compare that to our very worst which does not even make sense.  One's life should be more than just waiting for the next episode of Game of Thrones. Letting routine become the focal point of one's days can get very dissatisfying. It is easier to get trapped in one's comfort bubble and laze around in it but embracing change and popping that bubble will be worth it in the long run. Get yourself a new hobby or try to learn something which intimidates you. The challenges you overcome will establish a sense of achievement. Keep yourself productively busy and not just busy. Often times, we only focus on the results or the end-product of something but ignore enjoying the process of it. The significant other is a very important stakeholder of one's life. These are the people you will be sharing most of your meals with. What you have to decide is if you like sharing meals with them or if it feels like a drag. All I am saying is, for those who are in relationships, do not let it feel like chewing gum stuck to your sole (soul). For the ones who are single and operating in \"looking for the one\" mode, do not question yourself every time you become a third wheeler. Don't let your time on earth get ruined by the delayed arrival of your love interest. In the meantime, get a dog.   Sometimes, the best source of motivation is yourself. Immersing yourself in what drives you can become a getaway from all this turbulence. Even, if you are still unaware about what exactly drives you, then that is okay too. Choose to face your life one day at a time and try to be the best version of yourself and not of someone else.  All these approaches do not come with a guarantee. The subjectivity of everyone's scenario does not allow any penned down thumb rules that you can simply apply to shake off this crisis. Still, try to perceive everything with positivity and acknowledge that your life has already begun. Becoming more aware of one's present can be a way to deal with this too. Take a moment to breathe, appreciate being alive, head over to your favourite coffee shop and try to smile at life until the poorly made coffee ruins it for you. Don't be so hard on yourselves, my precious earthlings. Iqra suffers from wanderlust, dreams of discovering the Loch Ness Monster and occasionally complains about Economics.

      "text": "Dhaka, the capital of present day Bangladesh, is supposedly a 400-year-old city, established by Islam Khan in the year 1608 or 1610, and has also been the capital of the Mughal Subah (province) of Bengal intermittently. The city started on the banks of the Buriganga and expanded along the river. This is mainly because the area, due to the natural levee created by the river, had an elevation and was free from flooding and water logging. But there had been settlements in and around Dhaka even earlier, as can be seen from the map of Joao de Barros (one of the first great Portuguese historians) produced in 1550. Ralph Fitch, a British merchant, had reportedly seen Portuguese settlements at present day Tejgaon area in 1586, which was then four miles from the centre. Dhaka sits almost on the confluence of the tributaries of two large river basins, namely Meghna and Brahmaputra. Moreover, it contained two large canals, which sometimes have been termed as rivers (i.e. Dolai and Pandu River/ Canal). So, since the early days of the city, waterways and boats have played a significant role in its transport system, moving both passengers and goods. But swamps or marshes covered vast areas of the city, which made movement of large vessels quite difficult resulting in poor accessibility, not only in dry seasons but also during the monsoons. Walking, riding on ox-driven carts etc. were the other options for the general people, while the well off travelled by palanquins, horses or elephants. It has been surmised by some that there were no metalled roads in Dhaka before the Mughal period, which is not necessarily true. There is evidence that at least one regional road (Tongi-Dhaka-Narayanganj) existed as a connection to the Grand Trunk Road built by Sher Shah Suri. Along with the roads, the Mughals also built flood protection structures (such as bunds, or dykes) to protect the city from frequent flooding and dug up and extended the Dolai Canal for ease of movement of their Nowara (naval fleet). The transport system remained essentially the same--walking, animal driven carts, palanquins, animals and various kinds of boats--for about the next 200 years, though a few roads and bridges were made predominantly to facilitate movement of troops for defence purposes. Arrival of the Europeans\nAfter the arrival of the Europeans, especially the English, and the handover of administrative and political power to them, the transport system started to change mainly due to trade and business. Horse-driven carriages (hackney) were introduced as public transport in 1856, the first of its kind in Dhaka, although they were used privately by the corps since 1790. The first train came to the city in 1885, connecting the very important river port of Narayanganj, and in the next phase connected one of the main jute production centres of East Bengal, Mymensingh, with Dhaka. Private cars started to arrive to the city from the 1910s and taxis were introduced in the 1930s.\nSadarghat (probably during the 1980s).\nAfter the First World War, trucks and make-shift buses for troops which were left behind, were turned into public buses in the 1920s. Another very important mode of transport, rickshaws, were introduced in the mid-1930s. So, the preference of movement by waterways started to gradually shift towards rail and road as they provided faster, more dependable travel. In 1864, the city corporation was established, which started to build and maintain roads in a relatively organised manner. Road taxes were also introduced and utilised. From the 1920s rails and buses were competing in some cases, while introduction of rickshaws resulted in fierce competition from horse-carriage services. In the end some modes of transport went out of business altogether.\nHorse-Drawn Carriages\nHorse-Carriages were introduced in Dhaka as a form of public transport in 1856. These were Hackney carriages brought in by Armenian merchants. But before, British soldiers had brought one in 1790--along with the corps it soon disappeared.\nGhoragari (Landau) near Science Laboratory in 1966.\nNawab Shams-ud-Daulah of Dhaka bought one Landau carriage and was using it when Bishop Heber visited him in 1824.\nThe number of Hackneys in the city had not exceeded ten in the year 1840. But after introduction as a public transport, the travel mode became very popular. Their number increased from 60 in 1867 to 600 in 1889. The rising number of such modes of transport that also significantly picked up speed created chaos in the streets even back then.\nRailway\nRail came to India in 1853, both in Kolkata and Mumbai, within a short period of time. It came to Bangladesh first in 1862, as an extension from Kolkata to Kushtia. The British had a plan for Dhaka-Kolkata rail connection in 1856 but it never materialised, mostly because of huge costs and geographical challenges involved. In the end, rail was introduced in Dhaka in 1885, with the main station at Fulbaria, then almost at the boundary of the city.\nThe first rail track was between Dhaka and Narayananj and 10.25 miles long. Within a year (1886), another 75.5 mile track connected Dhaka with Mymensingh which was at first was used only for freight transport (mostly jute). Eventually it was opened for the public too, in steps. The total cost for the line was almost Taka 77 lakh back then. Obviously the engines ran on steam at first, with diesel engines arriving in the 1950s. But the steam engines were in operation even in the 1980s.\nAlthough it was a regional line and purposefully laid for freight transport, it got very popular. It can be said that rail was the most reliable, fast and comfortable mode of transport back then.\nRickshaw\nThere are various stories about how rickshaws came to Dhaka. According to Banglapedia, it came first to Chittagong (even before Dhaka) from Burma (Myanmar) in 1919. Gallagher, in his book, The Rickshaws of Bangladesh stated that, rickshaws first came to Mymensingh and Narayanganj, then to Dhaka in the 1930s. Based on Gallagher's assumption, Muntasir Mamoon has also stated that rickshaws came to Dhaka in 1937. Satyen Sen, in his memoirs, says two persons brought rickshaw from Chandannagar (now in West Bengal, India) in 1936-37. Based on the research done by Selim Rashid, it was in 1938, when the first rickshaw was introduced. The memoir of Mominul Islam Chowdhury says that a clerk from the Ralli Brothers Jute Mill in Narayanganj brought one rickshaw from Kolkata in 1940.\nSo it can be assumed that, rickshaws were introduced in Dhaka in a period between1930-1940. The number of rickshaws were 37 and 181 in the year 1941 and 1947 respectively. Licenses for rickshaws were introduced and distributed from 1944, and 100 licenses were given that year. Soon after, the transport mode got very popular and in the year 1948, the total number increased to 575!\nRickshaw in Dhaka in the 1960s.\nPrivate Cars\nNawab Salimullah at the wheel of a Dechamps Tonneau (model 1902) in 1904 Photo: Fritz Kapp Courtesy: Waqar A Khan\nThe first car owned in Dhaka was Nawab Salimullah's. It was bought and brought to Dhaka from Kolkata in 1904. Actually the Nawab family had a private car dealership for them which went by the name Dhaka Nawab Family Automobile (DNFA). This cannot be verified with proper sources, but probably a few other members of Dhaka's elite also started to buy cars in the 1920s, which we come to know from different memoirs.\nMawla Baksh, an interesting character from Dhaka's annals, went to Kolkata to work in motor workshops there, from sheer passion for motor cars. He came back to the city and joined as a foreman in the only motor workshop here, Excel Motor Workshop. It was situated in Nawabpur and run by the English. When they left in 1932, they left everything to Mawla Baksh. He immediately started his own workshop in Farashganj, and named it India Motor Works. It was taken over and used by the British during WWII. He got his workshop back in 1942 and moved to Laxmibazar. This was the first Bengali owned motor works in Dhaka.\nStreet scene of Nawabpur Road in 1960's.

Horse-driven carriages (hackney) were introduced as public transport in 1856, the first of its kind in Dhaka, although they were used privately by the corps since 1790. The first train came to the city in 1885, connecting the very important river port of Narayanganj, and in the next phase connected one of the main jute production centres of East Bengal, Mymensingh, with Dhaka. Private cars started to arrive to the city from the 1910s and taxis were introduced in the 1930s. After the First World War, trucks and make-shift buses for troops which were left behind, were turned into public buses in the 1920s. Another very important mode of transport, rickshaws, were introduced in the mid-1930s. So, the preference of movement by waterways started to gradually shift towards rail and road as they provided faster, more dependable travel. In 1864, the city corporation was established, which started to build and maintain roads in a relatively organised manner. Road taxes were also introduced and utilised. From the 1920s rails and buses were competing in some cases, while introduction of rickshaws resulted in fierce competition from horse-carriage services. In the end some modes of transport went out of business altogether. Horse-Drawn Carriages\nHorse-Carriages were introduced in Dhaka as a form of public transport in 1856. These were Hackney carriages brought in by Armenian merchants. But before, British soldiers had brought one in 1790--along with the corps it soon disappeared.\nGhoragari (Landau) near Science Laboratory in 1966.\nNawab Shams-ud-Daulah of Dhaka bought one Landau carriage and was using it when Bishop Heber visited him in 1824.\nThe number of Hackneys in the city had not exceeded ten in the year 1840. But after introduction as a public transport, the travel mode became very popular. Their number increased from 60 in 1867 to 600 in 1889. The rising number of such modes of transport that also significantly picked up speed created chaos in the streets even back then.\nRailway\nRail came to India in 1853, both in Kolkata and Mumbai, within a short period of time. It came to Bangladesh first in 1862, as an extension from Kolkata to Kushtia. The British had a plan for Dhaka-Kolkata rail connection in 1856 but it never materialised, mostly because of huge costs and geographical challenges involved. In the end, rail was introduced in Dhaka in 1885, with the main station at Fulbaria, then almost at the boundary of the city.\nThe first rail track was between Dhaka and Narayananj and 10.25 miles long. Within a year (1886), another 75.5 mile track connected Dhaka with Mymensingh which was at first was used only for freight transport (mostly jute). Eventually it was opened for the public too, in steps. The total cost for the line was almost Taka 77 lakh back then. Obviously the engines ran on steam at first, with diesel engines arriving in the 1950s. But the steam engines were in operation even in the 1980s.\nAlthough it was a regional line and purposefully laid for freight transport, it got very popular. It can be said that rail was the most reliable, fast and comfortable mode of transport back then.\nRickshaw\nThere are various stories about how rickshaws came to Dhaka. According to Banglapedia, it came first to Chittagong (even before Dhaka) from Burma (Myanmar) in 1919. Gallagher, in his book, The Rickshaws of Bangladesh stated that, rickshaws first came to Mymensingh and Narayanganj, then to Dhaka in the 1930s. Based on Gallagher's assumption, Muntasir Mamoon has also stated that rickshaws came to Dhaka in 1937. Satyen Sen, in his memoirs, says two persons brought rickshaw from Chandannagar (now in West Bengal, India) in 1936-37. Based on the research done by Selim Rashid, it was in 1938, when the first rickshaw was introduced.

The bridges are on the Purbo Kharibari village main road, a very important road that connects the left embankment of Teesta river leading to the upazila headquarters 25-km away at one end, and local border outpost of Border Guard Bangladesh close to the Bangladesh-India border at the other end. Visiting the site recently, this correspondent learned that one of the bridges was built at Jinjirpara by Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) in 2014-2015 fiscal year. The concrete bridge, fifty-foot-long and six-foot-wide, was built at a cost of Tk 20 lakh. \"It has been lying unused for around three years as the approach roads, which were built carelessly with sand without compaction, were washed away by flood in 2015, only six months after construction,\" said Yamin Hossain, 25, a local resident. Another bridge at Jijirpara of the same village is also without approach roads as they were washed away by flood in 2015. Photo: EAM Asaduzzaman\n \"LGED men seldom visit the area, although we brought the matter to the notice of the authorities concerned a number of times,\" said Md Shahin, 28, another resident. During the visit, another bridge without approach road was found on the same road at Meherpara of the village, one-km away from the first bridge. Hafizar Rahman, a villager, said the relief and disaster management department in Dimla constructed the thirty-eight-foot-long bridge at Meherpara in 2015-2016 fiscal year at a cost of Tk 32 lakh. But the approach roads on both the ends were washed away during the flood in 2017, one year after construction, as they were built with sand without planting grass on the slopes, he added. Tepa Kharibari Union Parishad Chairman Rabiul Islam Shahin said he had informed the LGED authorities and relief and disaster management office in Dimla about the damaged bridges. District LGED Executive Engineer Belal Hossain said Tk 40 lakh has been allocated for repair work of the Jinjir para bridge and approach roads and the work will start soon as tender process is completed. District Relief and Rehabilitation Officer Md Aktaruzzaman said they could not bring the Meher para bridge under flood rehabilitation project, but are preparing to start reconstruction of the approach roads under the upcoming work-for-taka project."

      "text": "Security at Saidpur Airport in the district remains vulnerable as a good portion of its east wall that collapsed during flood in August last year is yet to be repaired. The airport, the lone active one in Rangpur division, sees operation of a total of seven pairs of arrival and departure flights by Bangladesh Biman and three private companies. \"On August 12 last year, violent onrush of floodwater from the Kharkaria river beside the airport caused collapse of about 80 feet portion of its east boundary wall,\" local union parishad member Rafiqul Islam said during this correspondent's visit to the site at Baraishal village in Bangalipur union under Saidpur upazila on Monday. Curious people often enter the restricted place through the damaged portion of the wall to see flight operations while domestic animals find ways for grazing there, said Mantaj Ali, 60, a resident of the village. The airport authorities erected a fence of corrugate iron sheets, but a portion of it broke down within a few days, making the area open as before. Government-owned Bangladesh Biman and privately run US-Bangla Airways, Novo Air, Regent Airline operate seven pairs of arrival and departure operations from here daily, said Shahin Alam, manager of Saidpur Airport. Over one thousand passengers make air journey through this airport daily as foreigners and high officials of different factories in Uttara EPZ, Baropukuria coal mine, Madhyapara hard rock mine, delegates of international NGOs and government officials prefer it for convenient and time-saving journey to and from a few northern districts, he said. Mizanur Rahman, managing director of a local construction firm in Nilphamari, who goes to Dhaka every week for official purpose, said, \"We feel scared while making air journey as at time of landing and departure aircrafts fly too low beside the broken boundary wall when naughty boys can throw stones.\" The government should take urgent steps to ensure security at this busy airport on a priority basis, especially in view of the possibility of subversive activities by extremist groups, said Shafiqul Alam, former president of Nilphamari Chamber of Commerce and Industries. Airport Manager Shahin Alam, however, claimed that law enforcers always keep watchful eyes on the broken portion of the wall to ensure security. Re-construction work of the broken wall will start within one or two days as tender process has been completed, he said."

      "text": "As the oldest financial institution and a partner in progress for over 113 years, Standard Chartered has been intimately linked with the amazing growth story of Bangladesh.  It has worked with generations of its clients in driving prosperity, playing a role across all aspects of the economy with pioneering banking products and services.  The bank's commitment to Bangladesh extends beyond the economic and commercial sphere, and directly into its communities through its sustainability initiatives.  The initiatives over the years have focused on: economic empowerment of marginalised communities; bridging the gender gap; improving access to health, education and financial literacy; supporting agricultural innovation; promoting sports, arts and culture as drivers of positive social transformation; and raising awareness about climate change and environment.  The bank invests in local communities across Bangladesh, reaching some of the most vulnerable segments of the society, addressing some of their most pressing needs.  A good example of this is the integrated livelihood project the bank operates in partnership with Brac in the ex-enclave communities in Lalmonirhaat and Kurigram. \nIn 2016, Standard Chartered Bangladesh became the first international bank to begin working with the communities, providing them with income generating vocational training in horticulture, livestock rearing, ICT, financial education and so on, and in view of the absence of basic sanitation services, latrine facilities. The work focused on improving the quality of life of the vulnerable communities through promoting literacy, livelihood generation, better hygiene and financial empowerment. The bank's flagship community programme 'Seeing is Believing', which tackles avoidable blindness globally, has touched the lives of 150 million people by funding 160 eye care projects in under-privileged communities globally since it began its journey in 2003.  Interestingly, it is a journey that began right here in Bangladesh.  It started with the building of an operation theatre and a children's ward at Ispahani Islamia Eye Institute & Hospital and since then the bank has been financially supporting their maintenance.  The construction of a new Paediatric Ophthalmology Outpatient building at the hospital is also underway as a part of the initiative.  In Bangladesh, the programme focuses on raising awareness of eye health, delivering outreach screening and treatment services to under-privileged communities, and capacity building for ophthalmologists, eye care nurses and other healthcare workers. \nAs of now, 62,943 cataract surgeries have been successfully completed and 106,313 refraction services provided in Bangladesh. Eye check-up facilities were provided to 1,139,597 beneficiaries and 5,920 eye-care providers trained.   Research clearly shows that educating girls and giving them tools to shape their own future have an incredible intergenerational multiplier effect on communities. The bank's Goal programme aims to do just that.  Goal is a global programme run by the bank, which began in Bangladesh in 2013. The programme provides life skills training to empower girls with the confidence, knowledge and skills they need to be integral economic leaders in their families and communities.  Until now, the programme has empowered 32,015, created 700 Goal leaders and provided leadership and employability training to 1,400.  The lack of financial education is a key barrier to financial inclusion, especially amongst vulnerable population such as the youth.  Through its Financial Education for Youth programme, the bank is committed to building financial capability among school children with the view to influencing behavioural change and ingraining financial responsibility from an early age.  The curriculum, developed by Standard Chartered's Global team, has been translated to Bangla. Since 2016, the programme reached 20 schools and 2,000 youths -- around 90 percent of whom are girls -- in rural and semi-urban areas in Chittagong. Standard Chartered believes in the ability of the youth to be an agent of positive change. The Standard Chartered-The Daily Star Celebrating Life aims to inspire youths to be a force for good, helping their unfettered creative expression and talent shine bright. \nCelebrating Life is a platform that nurtures budding artists, promotes their talents and helps them shine brightly on the national stage. \nThe Celebrating Life District Festivals spread the joy of celebrations to every corner of the country. In the last ten years over 45,000 have participated in the contest and about 170,000 have attended. \nStandard Chartered also promotes the development of youth through scholarship grants and institutional support at various levels. \nHelping differently-abled youths live a full life is a key part of its agenda, and it supports Parents Forum for the Differently Able and Autism Welfare Foundation, which run schools and vocational training centres for differently-abled students. \n It has also sponsored and is actively involved with the Young Learners Centre of The British Council, which promotes the joy of reading among youth, for the last 17 years.   \nIn order to maintain its growth trajectory, Bangladesh has over the years prioritised attracting foreign investment. \nStandard Chartered, itself among the largest foreign investors in Bangladesh, is continuing its efforts to bring in more foreign investment to the country. \nIn 2016, the Bank organised the Bangladesh Investment Summit in Hong Kong. This was the sixth time Standard Chartered had organised an investment summit outside of Bangladesh. \nAs a regional investment hub, Singapore has been identified as a priority destination and the bank has organised investment summits there in 2012, 2014 and 2015. Standard Chartered has also organised investment summits in London in 2013 and 2015,in partnership with Bangladesh Investment Development Authority, previously known as Board of Investment.\nWhile Bangladesh's journey of progress has seen the development of its manufacturing and service sectors, the agriculture sector which employs almost half of the national work force directly or indirectly, remains vital as ever. \nStandard Chartered Agrow Award recognises the leaders and visionaries who are taking the agriculture sector to new heights. \nThe bank also strongly believes in transformational capacity of business in promoting sustainable development. \nThe Standard Chartered-Financial Express Corporate Social Responsibility Award showcases the best sustainability initiatives undertaken by the businesses sector, with the hope that they can serve as inspiration to others. \nStandard Chartered is committed to standing beside the nation's most vulnerable and marginalised communities during their times of need. \nBeyond our active and sustainable community programmes, we also work to provide emergency support, such as post-flood rehabilitation and medical support, warm clothes and blankets during winter, whenever the need arises.\nThe bank supports research efforts in areas of history, arts and culture, seeking to make a difference and bring to light little known events and artworks of historical significance. \nNotable works in this sphere have included publications of book \"Coins from Bangladesh\" -- a special compilation of the history of coins found in the region from ancient period, medieval period and colonial to modern period. \nStandard Chartered has also published the first bilingual edition of \"Chhinnapatra\" -- a very special compilation of photographs clicked by Dr Noazesh Ahmed based on Tagore's famous literary creation; an English translation of Kazi Nazrul Islam's novella \"Badhon Hara\"; a Bengali translation of The Honey Hunter, titled \"Modhu Shikari\", an illustrated book for children that depicts the delicate ecological balance of the Sundarbans; \"Dhaka alias Jahangirnagar: 400 years\"; \"Street Traders of Bangladesh\"; \"Ekush\"; and \"Rare Photographs of East Bengal 1880-1940\".\nFor 113 years, Standard Chartered has been a proud witness to the unstoppable journey of Bangladesh. \nIt has been a witness to innovation, ingenuity, courage and resilience, all hallmarks of the people of this great nation. \nThe destination of becoming a middle income nation might be near, but the aspirations of the nation extend far beyond. As ever, Standard Chartered Bank stands ready to partner with Bangladesh on its next journey of progress. \nThe writer is country head of corporate affairs at Standard Chartered Bangladesh."

      "text": "One evening, not too many evenings ago, when Sammer Ali from Rajshahi's Charghat set off by a buffalo cart, it was almost empty but hopes were high. Some 50 kilometres ahead are the vast paddy fields of the Chalan Beel wetland. With the Boro paddy harvest underway, Sammer is sure to find work. \"I'll spend three weeks in the fields,\" says Sammer, an agricultural labourer. \"When I'm done, I'll return home with the paddy I earned.\" Sammer is not alone in expecting to be paid in paddy. Many of the hundreds of prospective labourers attracted to the Chalan Beel area during the current Boro harvest, and also in November when Aman paddy is harvested, expect the same. Indeed they prefer it. \"The paddy I earn will feed my family for half a year,\" Sammer says. \"I'll also sell some.\" The local cash rate for a farm labourer is around Tk 300 per day. Labourers paid in paddy can earn an effective daily rate of up to Tk 1,000. Harvest has some urgency in the wetlands. With the arrival of monsoon, many parts of Chalan Beel, currently awash with green sheaves, will go under five feet of water. At the same time, the paddy harvest in other districts is still a month away. \"The paddy grown in these areas is harvested earlier to avoid storm and flood damage,\" says SM Mustafizur Rahman, additional director at the Department of Agricultural Extension in Rajshahi. \"At this time of the year, labourers in districts like Kushtia, Jessore, Lalmonirhat and Nilphamari don't have much work to do,\" Prof Elias Hossain from Rajshahi University's economics department explains. \"That's why they take their chances in the beel areas.\" In recognition of the paddy payment system, the professor calls the biannual migration the economics of non-employment. Yet to the many labourers and their families who rely on it, it's a system of vital importance. One of them is Akbar Ali, who has arrived as part of a group of 25 from Sirajganj's Shahjadpur. They've set up a makeshift camp of bamboo and corrugated iron sheeting on the roadside. \"We will stay here for the harvest's duration and organise our own food,\" Akbar says. They get five kilograms of paddy for every 40 kg harvested. After working for about a month, each of them will amass at least 1.2 tonnes of paddy before returning home. Sammer meanwhile has found even more favourable circumstances. The land owner he is working for has agreed to provide both him and his buffaloes with food and shelter in addition to his share of paddy. \"It's easier for us to pay labourers with paddy,\" says one farmer, Aftab Hossain, from Achrakhali village in Natore's part of the beel area. \"We save on rice processing costs and the cost of taking that paddy to market. We also don't need to have cash at hand.\" The Department of Agricultural Extension estimates a Boro harvest of four tonnes per hectare in the beel areas this season. Across the Rajshahi region, around 3.71 lakh hectares has been sown with Boro paddy this year."

      "text": "Despite the usual gloomy narratives, there are opportunities to transform Dhaka into a modern but ecologically attuned metropolis. The transformation can be carried out with our own resources, and our own imagination. Bangladesh's rising economy presents new possibilities but calls for new imagination. In the planning of our cities, conventionalised practices need to be reviewed and reframed. The western area of Dhaka, along Turag River, holds the key to what Dhaka can become with its natural and constructed conditions. With its floodplains and wetlands that are still in a generous state, and despite the presence of an embankment, the western area is very much a hydraulic environment. Compared to the eastern part of Dhaka--Purbachal and areas east of it--where original wetlands, rice fields, undulating land forms, and forested areas have been completely destroyed to prop up the image of an ordinary city, the west still resonates with the living rhythm of wetlands and floodplains. While we claim that the city of Dhaka arose on the banks of Buriganga, it is possible that a 21st-century city can emerge on the edge of the Turag, creating a west bank for the city. Defined by the Turag river flowing down from north of Ashulia and heading towards the Buriganga further south, the western bank is formed by a slice of silted land between the river and the embankment. Rich with potential, this triple formation--river, embankment and banks--frames Uttara, Mirpur and Aminbazar on the city side of the embankment, and vast floodplains on the river side. Before it makes its slow descent south, the Turag splits eastward in Ashulia area to form the Tongi canal that flows further east to connect with river Balu. The rivers also flow across tracts of land splitting into numerous canals, channels and ponds to form an intricate network of water bodies and complex web of flows. Such a dynamic landform has formed the very soul and substance of Dhaka region. Yet it is this land and water network that is being abused and destroyed by wanton landfilling and unplanned usage. Any planning policy or scheme that tries to bypass this fact about the soul of Dhaka is bound to be a folly, eventually compounding the problems of Dhaka in the name of doing something new. Purbachal, idealised as the flagship urban development by the city authorities, and Bashundhara, the biggest private residential area in the city, both of which define our lopsided urban growth, rely on a brutal ecological change to a precious landscape. They advance the image of a modern city, but at what price? And what kind of a city is it? To the first question, we list: Thoughtless landfilling, changing ecologies, biotic destructions, more floods, rising urban temperatures, lower aquifer level, and more waterlogging. And to the question \"What kind of a city?\" we see nothing more than plots and buildings. One would expect that an area of such magnitude would be designed by renowned and established designers, as was the case for Chandigarh, Islamabad or Putrajaya. That is not the case in Dhaka. Planned by anonymous planners in top offices of state agencies or real estate companies, the sites in Dhaka do not give evidence of a higher or newer understanding of planning cities, forming communities, dealing with an aquatic landscape, and making public spaces. There is a stark difference between the two wings of Dhaka that were once similar, and now have become two separate narratives. While the eastern side represents massive geographic damage in the name of making cities, the west side still retains original aquatic conditions, and presents a new opportunity for making a city that could truly be modern and geographically attuned. If planned well. Created following the floods of 1988 and 1998, the nearly 35km-long embankment is the most remarkable engineering presence on the western side. While various critical questions arise these days about the viability of embankments, the western embankment forms the fundamental reference for any major development on that side. At the end of the day, all development activities on the edge of present-day Dhaka--east or west--are premised on how we deal with water as all urban peripheral terrains are wetlands, floodplains, agricultural land, and canal systems. Much of the ongoing pattern of land development in those peripheral areas ignores the hydrological realm. Recent propositions by various agencies promise a planning panacea for eastern Dhaka, with a development ethic that touts Pudong Shanghai and Singapore as models. Other than a glitzy image--and more landfilling--they offer little. Most importantly, such ideas are silent about either the hydrological or public realm. We imagine a different vision for western Dhaka: With over a 17km length stretching from Aminbazar-Gabtoli to Tongi Bridge, the triple strip of river, embankment and riverbank offers a challenging but wonderful opportunity of forming a new river edge. It may be the thinnest, longest urban spine, but with calculated decisions can be Dhaka's longest and biggest public realm. There are quite a few things the citizens of Dhaka lack, which pushes it to the lowest state of livable cities. One is a generous and vibrant public realm available for all. Keeping the stipulations of DAP in mind, the 17km-long strip can be the site of the longest public park with promenades, maidans, gardens, fields, orchards, and festival grounds that the people of Dhaka can go to and enjoy. In certain nodal areas, cultural, recreational and athletic facilities can be constructed, all on stilts so that flood water can flow easily. Besides the river, there are also wetlands and canals. Wetlands on the western side of the embankment are connected to the river, and those within the embankment are traces of an old system, now forming pockets (marked as \"retention ponds\" in DAP documents). Such wetland areas within the city can be used as retention ponds for tackling waterlogging, as a rich zone for biodiversity, and as a new kind of public park. Such new usages will be a lesson in benefiting from wetlands in a dense urban fabric, and providing for ecological security and sustainable development. Another lack for Dhaka is social and group housing--the clustering of buildings that enable community formation. Such group housing can be aligned around the edge of wetlands creating an innovative environment in which residents can enjoy the magnificent view of a water landscape, while the lineup of buildings can form a protective edge for securing the wetlands. Such arrangements can balance building development with the enrichment of the landscape. The existing embankment can host a new city-wide transport loop for the city, with a circular road and train (as already planned by the Railways). By developing Turag river as a new water-based transport connectivity, the western edge can be defined by new transport corridors linking road, river and rail. For Dhaka's west bank, we imagine a new city pattern in which wetlands and canals will remain as they are but their edges defined by appropriate urban and architectural developments. The canal banks can be developed as a city that appreciates its water landscape and makes it part of a totally new urban experience. Not unlike Suzhou or Venice. The canals themselves can be a source of a new water-bus transport, perhaps linking with the Turag river corridor. With such a transformation, the western area can be Dhaka's crown development.

      "text": "Allegations of irregularities have been raised over renovation of the Dhepa river embankment using sand by Water Development Board (WDB) in Biral upazila of the district. Locals alleged that WDB is repairing the flood control embankment that developed several cracks at different points along the river during the flood last year using sand and may collapse again if the water level increases further in the ongoing rainy season. The most vulnerable points of the flood control embankment include Chawkchawka, Maljhar and Dumurtoli area in the upazila. People living in the areas said the earthen flood control embankment, constructed about 29 years ago along Dhepa river, was washed away at different points due to increase of water level during the flood in August last year, eroding vast tracts of cropland and many homesteads in those areas. Cracks have developed in at least 60 points, damaging nearly 100 bridges and around 200 kilometre road in nine out of 13 upazilas of the district. Earlier, Dinajpur WDB authorities floated a tender for the repair work of the damaged embankment in February this year.  According to the tender, earth and bamboos are supposed to be use in the repair work and the embankment should be covered up with grass for strengthening its stability. But locals alleged that the contractor concerned is repairing the embankment using sand extracted from the river. During a recent visit to the area this correspondent found labourers repairing the damaged points of the embankment using sand collected from nearby Dhepa river and later covering the sand with thick earthen layer. \"Use of sand is not enough to tackle the huge pressure of the river water,\" Nazrul Islam of Chawkchawka village said, adding that they have informed the WDB officials several times about the irregularities, but they did not pay heed to their complaint. Many villagers said if the water level of Dhepa river further increases the sand-made embankment will surely be washed away and their croplands nearby the embankment will be covered with sand. Meanwhile, an engineer of WDB in Dinajpur, seeking anonymity, said it would have been good if the contractor concerned used sand bags rather than using it directly from the river, and it may be washed away again if the water level of the river increases. Motiur Rahman, a sub-contractor of the embankment repair work, said it is a new method of repairing embankments as there is a shortage of earth in the locality. Dinajpur WDB Executive Engineer Foyzur Rahman said they have special instruction to rebuild the damaged embankment using sand to stop waste of soil."

      "text": "LS DeskNovember 27, 2018 Tagore, with the masterful weaving of words, knew best  how to portray the women in his life. Whether it was their strong character, beauty or timidity; he knew how to appreciate each of their individuality through delightful expressions. In our wedding issue, we pick out celebrated words from the legendary poet; as if he were personally wooing each of the beautiful brides for their splendour and striking beauty. Whether it's the libretto or the mystique charm of the ladies, we are hopeful that you will enjoy flipping through the pages; watching our dusky beauties come alive, with all the grandeur, glamour and aura. The more I hear that long lost story,\n and the pangs of that ancient love, of a tale of love lost and found, from distant memory comes a vision. Across the dark night of time at last I see your face, eternally bright, a constant guiding star in midst of life. ---( Everlasting Love) I seem to have loved you in\n numberless forms, numberless times... In life after life, in age after age, forever. My spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs, that you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms. -- (Everlasting Love)   Love's writing a song in dainty letters,\n layers of kiss-calligraphy on lips. Plucking flowers from two sets of lips Perhaps to thread them into a chain later. This sweet union of lips is the red marriage-bed of a pair of smiles. -- (The Kiss)   Words have wooed yet failed to win her;\n persuasion has stretched to her its eager arms in vain. I have roamed from country to country keeping her in the core of my heart, and around her have risen and fallen the growth and decay of my life. -- (Gitanjali)   We have swam together\n you and I, in this stream of love from its source in the heart of times long gone by. We have played with delight with a million other lovers, bathed in tears of happiness and pain, bashful in the grasp of togetherness - a timeless bond in ever changing form. -- (Everlasting Love)   That undying flame of love\n today finds its place in glorious abandon at your feet. Universal joy and sorrow, the devotion within the universal soul, have all come to bear fruit in this one love of ours imbued with the memory of all who have loved before - one hears it in the songs sung by the poets down the ages. -- (Everlasting Love)   My soul is alight with your infinitude of stars.\n Your world has broken upon me like flood. The flowers of your garden blossom in my body; the joy of life that is everywhere burns like an incense in my heart. And the breath of all things plays on my life as on a pipe of reeds. -- (The Gardener)   With a glance of your eyes\n you could plunder all wealth of songs from poets' harps, fair woman! But for their praises you have no ear; therefore do I come to praise you. -- (The Gardener)   O woman, you are not merely the\n handiwork of God, but also of men; these are ever endowing you with beauty from their hearts. Poets are weaving for you a web with threads of golden imagery; painters are giving your form ever new immortality. --- (The Gardener)   The sea gives its pearls, the mines\n their gold, the summer gardens their flowers to deck you, to cover you, to make you more precious. The desire of men's hearts has shed its glory over your youth. You are one half woman and one half dream. --- (O Woman)   The one that I consider a modern dame\n I am indebted to her indeed for my fame. I have always received the very best indeed I have had reward and punishment, when in need. I have left proof enough that today's woman has influenced the flow of life in this old man. -- (The Modern Woman)   A coarse sari tightly winds around her\n dark slim limbs. Probably some absent minded artisan of God Both her wings remain concealed and unseen within. Walking and flying have mingled in her tilting gait. -- (The Santal)   PORTFOLIO CREDITS Photo: Sazzad Ibne Sayed Make-up and Hair: Noyon Ahamed and Niloy Styling: Sonia Yeasmin Isha Location: Mermaid Beach Resort, Cox's Bazar Poet: Rabindranath Tagore Translations: Collected"

      "text": "Water is an essential fluid on which all life depends. Even then, access to clean and safe drinking water is one of the most pressing, yet relatively overlooked issues in Bangladesh. Consuming contaminated water is not only unhygienic, but also life-threatening. Especially in a congested city like Dhaka, one can never be too careful about waterborne diseases. Working to provide clean water to the communities has turned crucial, and this is where Project Trishna takes on its main role. Project Trishna is a volunteer-driven social venture conceptualised and developed by Footstep Foundation, a youth-based social enterprise which started its journey in 2013. The project's aim is to provide free access to clean and safe drinking water for the general public, especially the underserved sectors. The initiative appeals to individuals and enterprises that may buy one of Project Trishna's customised water filters. Private enterprises maintain these filters as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). These filters are set up on sidewalks or in front of buildings and offices to provide a source of free clean drinking water to anyone who needs it. Project Trishna looks at water as a basic human right rather than a commodity to make a profit from.  They currently use Reverse Osmosis technology to purify water. However, they are planning to switch from Reverse Osmosis to resin nanotechnology soon. Their devices are set up in over 20 locations in the city, including Rampura, Banasree, Gulshan, Banani, Dilkusha, Shangshad Avenue, Mirpur, Mitford and Baily Road. They also aim to set up devices outside of Dhaka. Shah Rafayat Chowdhury, President and Co-founder of Footsteps Foundation and a student of Environmental Economics at Pennsylvania State University in the USA, says, \"Every community is unique in its own way, and we must ensure a solution that tends to the exact needs of the community. Once we reach a certain number of devices in the city, we plan to expand to Chittagong and then to other municipalities of the country.\"Mohammad Taqi Yasir is the Vice President of the organisation. We have all witnessed the waterlogs and how the entire country becomes a gridlock during monsoon. The flood water makes it difficult for the entire city to function. Project Trishna wishes to improve this condition as well.  Shah Rafayat adds, \"We also have plans to harness flood water and turn it into an entrepreneurial opportunity.\" Furthermore, in a study by Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC), reported in The Daily Star in 2017, it is shown that E. coli bacteria is found in 98 percent jar water samples, collected from 24 points of the capital.  Diseases such as typhoid, cholera, and jaundice are caused because of such impurities in the water. So, while providing access to free water to the mass, Project Trishna must also ensure the purity of the water. They use a pocket-sized electrolysis machine to test the impurities. The electrolysis machine exposes the iron content in water. The water containing iron turns yellow after electrolysis. It comes in handy when they need to prove the condition of the water to other people on the spot. Since people should be careful about what they are consuming, it is devices like these that make people believe in the cause. The project has grown significantly since its inception in 2015. In the beginning, their manual device could carry only 23-litres of water. However, their latest ones can purify over 280-litres of water in a day.  They currently have 75 devices established in the city which allow access to over 5 million litres of free clean drinking water with assistance from their CSR clients. Over the years, the project has seen many noteworthy accomplishments. Currently, Project Trishna has over 30 clients, including companies like City Bank and notable individuals such as the newly appointed Environment and Forestry Minister Barrister Annisul Islam Mahmud. The project has been chosen as one of the 60 global change making projects by the Swiss NGO Global Changemakers to be represented at the Global Youth Summit 2017. Nevertheless, the team behind Project Trishna faced many setbacks to reach this point. One of the challenges was criticism regarding their first device, because it had bugs in it. The team now continually develops the different aspects and design of their devices to make sure they are achieving their purpose. Educating people about safe drinking water served as another challenge.`\"Many people have misconceptions about drinking water; they think that if the water is clear then it must be pure. People are misinformed about boiling water as well. Boiling water can kill the bacteria and viruses, but it does not remove metallic elements such as asbestos and arsenic which accumulate in our organs and expose symptoms later in life. Each challenge has motivated us more to work on a solution to the problem,\" explains Rafayat. As for the funding, Project Trishna has three main sources of revenue: sale of devices, servicing of devices, and external funding. They receive a contracted annual fee from their clients. This money is used to service and maintain the device for the entire duration. Moving forward, Project Trishna hopes to address the water problem in both rural and urban communities to ensure access to clean and safe water for all by 2030. Since this initiative is working towards solving a vital problem, the general mass should also cooperate to help the project grow. The importance of clean and safe drinking water should be engraved in us and the people around us through raising awareness. More companies should step forward to pursue Project Trishna's water devices in order to address the drinking water crisis. Impactful change takes time, but its results can be life-changing. The team behind Project Trishna are determinedly and committedly doing their part to reduce the health risks of the country to a great extent, as a healthy country will be prosperous for all."

High tide due to the impact of full moon has also damaged Aman seedbeds on vast tracts of land in those villages. Besides, most of the village roads went under water that entered through many damaged portions of different flood control dykes. Thousands of vehicles got stuck at Lebukhali ferry terminal on Patuakhali-Barisal road as ferry services remain stopped for the last four days after the area went under water due to the high tide, ferry supervisor Abdur Rashid said. Several hundred fishing trawlers took shelter at different points along Shibbaria river and two fish landing stations in Alipur and Mohipur in Patuakhali's Kalapara upazila, Alipur Fish Traders Association President Ansar Uddin Mollah said, adding that the fishing trawlers came to the shore as the sea became very rough. Over 60 villages in Rangabali, Galachipa, Dashmina and Mirzaganj upazilas of the district have been flooded due to the tidal surge. Meanwhile, many houses and business establishments in at least 10 villages under Lalua union in Kalapara upazila went under water as breaches developed in the flood control embankment along Ramnabad river. Trader Nurul Kabir Jhunu said Baliatali ferry terminal on Kalapara-Kuakata alternative road also went under water due to the high tide. At least five villages in Mirzaganj upazila have been flooded after seawater entered through breaches of the flood control embankment along Payra river. Patuakhali Water Development Board (WDB) Executive Engineer Md Hasanuzzaman said they will take steps to repair the damaged dyke after the ongoing monsoon. Meanwhile, most of the Aman seedbeds in 40 villages under Taltali, Amtali, Patharghata and Bamna upazilas of Barguna were flooded due to the tidal surge. \"Fish worth Tk three lakh cultivated on my two enclosures were washed away due to the tidal surges,\" Toiyab Gazi of Ghopkhali village in Taltali upazila said. WDB's record keeper of water level Abul Kalam Azad said water level of the Payra river was flowing 25 centimetres above the danger mark yesterday noon."

      "text": "Maqsoodul Haque (Mac): It was the drive to help the flood victims of 1987 which led to the formation of BAMBA. My friend Rebecca Hossain, who was also Hamin's friend, was visiting Dhaka from abroad in 1987, when she suggested an initiative to assist the flood victims. It was decided that a three-day charity concert will be arranged at the Sheraton Hotel by the leading bands. Renaissance, Miles, Images and other bands joined the concert. A total of BDT 2.5 lac was raised at the concert and donated for the rehabilitation of the flood victims. A similar initiative was also undertaken in 1988, when BAMBA organized a two-day charity concert and donated the amount collected to reconstruct the houses of some flood victims in Manikganj area. BAMBA has played a pivotal role in popularizing band music among the audience in Bangladesh. BAMBA has organized multiple charity concerts, open-air concerts and indoor concerts over the years and have hosted a couple of music reality shows, creating platforms for promising bands. Hamin Ahmed: BAMBA is currently working on generating awareness regarding intellectual property rights in the music industry. BAMBA's focus is more than just arranging concerts. For nearly nine years, BAMBA has been battling the growing menace of piracy affecting the artists of the music industry. Piracy has taken a huge toll on the efforts, morale and livelihood of the artists in the music industry by depriving them of their right to their own creations. It is essential now to create awareness about the issue among the stakeholders, especially the deprived artists and empower them to overcome this problem. Maqsoodul: Artists are being deprived of their rights every day in our country. Neither the radio stations airing songs, nor companies playing them every minute of the day for their commercial gains, pay royalty to the artists. And the stores selling pirated music in hard drives or websites hosting free downloadable music are only adding to the problem. Hamin: Artists, singers, lyricists and composers these days are facing a huge problem in ensuring copyright of their own creations. In order to address this issue, BAMBA has held discussions with all relevant stakeholders. BAMBA had extensive talks with World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers (CISAC) regarding intellectual property rights and related issues in Bangladesh. Over the years, BAMBA has worked with the LCS (Lyricists, Composers, Singers) Guild of Bangladesh to secure the CMO license, and formed Bangladesh Lyricists, Composers and Performers Society (BLCPS). The CMO license enables us to legally act in the interest and on behalf of the original owners' creations. Bangladesh is a culturally aware nation, and it is unfortunate that this problem of piracy is worsening by the day, affecting the work being produced in our music industry. Although BLCPS has managed to secure the CMO license, we are still a long way from fully implementing its rights. The guidelines set by WIPO is adhered to in most countries, but we are still far behind. Mohammad Ali Shumon: These days even the distributors are taking advantage of the artists. Artists do not give up their right over their creations when they allow the distributors the right to sell their music. Fuad Naser Babu: It is essential to fully implement the WIPO guidelines to ensure the rights of the creators. Otherwise, the music industry will suffer greatly. At this point, the morale of some of the artists are very low, given  the scenario and the number of CDs being released every year has declined significantly. Monirul Alam Tipu: In the earlier days, fans used to wait for bands/singers to release their albums; these days, they only wait for singles to be made available for free streaming on the internet. Hamin: People living in the far corners of the country who do not have easy access to internet still want to buy CDs. However, due to the pressures of piracy, many bands/artists have stopped releasing CDs altogether. Who is really getting paid for all the free airing and streaming of music - who is benefitting from these? Hamin: The main aim of BAMBA right now is not to arrange concerts; but it is to work towards ensuring proper implementation of the intellectual property rights of the artists working in the music industry of Bangladesh, including the singers, lyricists and composers. Maqsoodul: Apart from the pressure of current activities, the lack of venues is also a reason why BAMBA is not able to arrange concerts more frequently. Doza Alan: Securing permission to use stadiums to arrange open-air concerts is a very challenging task, and the available indoor auditoriums are not big enough to accommodate the fans. Therefore, often the lack of venues acts as a hindrance while arranging a concert. Tipu: This reminds me of a fond memory. Back in 1992, when BAMBA had organized a concert at the WVA auditorium, all the four locks of the gate broke open at the same time, creating a thunderous noise! The loud sound was due to the pressure of many people entering through the gate, which was an amazing sight to behold. Hamin: Apart from securing the CMO license, BLCPS has also registered with the Copyright Office under the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. The current government has been very supportive of initiatives involving intellectual property rights and related issues, which has given our work and morale a significant boost, but much more needs to be done to help every creator have rights over their creations in the music industry. Babu: The current government, especially Asaduzzaman Noor, Hon'ble Minister for Cultural Affairs, has been very sympathetic towards our cause for intellectual property rights and has provided support to our initiatives. The laws of this country are also favorable towards the artists, and it is essential to ensure its stringent implementation to curb piracy for good. The roundtable ended on a positive note, with the participants expressing optimism in overcoming the challenges the music industry is currently facing. Mohammad Ali Shumon summarized that, with the support of the government and the artists and proper execution of our laws, it will be possible to restore the right of every artist over their creations, ensuring a sustainable future of our music industry. Star Showbiz wishes BAMBA every success in its future endeavors. Star Showbiz Desk\n \n  "

      "text": "Climate change is no more a hidden issue. The LANCET report on 'Pollution' published on October 22, 2017 claims that 'nearly 92% pollution related deaths occur in low-income and middle-income countries' and the fossil fuel combustion in higher-income countries and burning of biomass in lower-income countries accounts for 85% of air pollution which is closely related to climate change. The list of Environmental Performance Index enlisted Bangladesh as the second worst country in curbing environmental pollution. Bangladesh being an over populated developing country is constantly facing the challenge of coping with the environmental degradations due to climate change. Year by year, the records of the past are broken in almost all the outburst due to changes in climate pattern. The flood of 2017 which surpassed all the records of past did not occurred from our own territorial activities rather it's a trans-national issue which is been identified in many inter-governmental conferences. To combat the crisis of climate change, Bangladesh has already established a national climate fund titled Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund. The government has also adopted the National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA 2005) under the requirement of UNFCC (United Nations Framework Convention on the Climate Change 1992) setting out 15 immediate adaptation measures. Other measures of the government include making of the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategic Action Plan (BCCSAP) 2009, the Disaster Management Act 2010, the Control of Brick Burning Act 2013, the amalgamation of three individual ministries into one- Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The developed countries were committed under Kyoto Protocol 1997 to curb their anthropogenic emissions of CFC, carbon-di-oxide, methane, etc. to a rate as set by the Protocol which was supposed to expire in 2012, but they failed and extended their commitment period up to 2018 in Doha Decision (Conference of the Parties 18). Under this Protocol, the developed countries are also bound to curb carbon emissions through emission trading with the developing countries by expanding the technological support to enlarge the environment friendly development works in developing countries. But as we are known with the ship breaking business we can realise what we are getting in the name of technological support. Despite having all kinds of laws regarding the preservation of environment, we are repeatedly facing with immense failure. The reason is that a single country like Bangladesh cannot win the fight on its own when the issue (i.e. climate change) is a global one. This is an appeal to all of the countrymen and the international environment activist to get united to stop such horrible crimes that are yet to be recognised as crimes against environment and take a step forward to recognise the pollution as a criminal offence. Because a harm to the common interest is a crime against all the commons. In all levels, let us stand against pollution and say unitedly - stop, before it's too late!

      "text": "Children at Sirajganj's Kagmari char are now free from the hassle of making risky journeys to school on boats. They thank O Aa Ka Kha School, the brainchild of Sirajganj resident Dr Nazmul Islam, for that. The school not only saves the little learners' time but also provides them with education materials at a monthly fee of Tk 10 only.  It all started in 2016 when Nazmul, a graduate of Gonoshasthaya Samaj Vittik Medical College, received a blow in his persuasion of MBBS after he failed in a course on surgery. But instead of lamenting over it, Nazmul made the best possible use of his time by setting up the school in Savar on the outskirts of Dhaka. In January this year, he extended his vision and established another branch for the children at Kagmari char, which is about 10 kilometres off his home town. Twenty of his friends, who were studying at the same medical school in Savar, supported him in his mission. Sabina Yasmin, 9, feared that she might end up as a dropout as she had to go to Bhuapur upazila of Tangail to pursue education before O Aa Ka Kha was born. \"Due to safety concerns on the river way, many of my female friends stopped going to the school in Bhuapur,\" Yasmin told this correspondent recently. Her friend Swarna Khatun narrated how she braved rain and scorching heat while making the journeys by boat. \"Now I can let go off the worry of drowning and happily travel to my new school,\" said Swarna. Her mother, Monju Ara, expressed gratitude to the school founders. \"I was struggling to meet the expenses. They give our children education, books, uniforms, bags, stationeries and medical services at a minimal cost of Tk 10.\" Dr Zakir Hossain Manik, another founder of the school thriving on the bed of the Jamuna river, said: \"First we gathered children from Niribili slum for the Savar branch. We try to provide them with vocational training as well.\" During a recent visit to the Kagmari branch, this correspondent found that 90 children were attending classes from grades one to five and most of the teachers were university students. Classes are held six days a week, said Israt Jahan Lamia, who has been with the school as a teacher since its inception. \"They take part in different extracurricular activities as well,\" said Lamia, a current student at Gonoshasthaya Samaj Vittik Medical College. Nazmul said O Aa Ka Kha School has a centre which provides training on sewing and has a library which is open to all. \"Well-wishers\" are the main source of finance for this school, said the physician. Besides that, Texprego Bangladesh, a manufacturer and exporter of knitwear products, also helps them run the school as part of its corporate social responsibilities. \"The garment company came to know about our activities through Facebook and since then had been a support,\" added Nazmul, who now works as a medical officer at Gonoshasthaya College."

      "text": "\"Four legs good, two legs bad,\" is a famous quote of George Orwell, brilliantly put in his time-winning satirical fable Animal Farm. This seems to be the other way round, or so it appears, when you wander around Dhaka, a city of lifeless wheelers. Here, four legs, unlike the rebellious animals in the book, don't do any good other than releasing a veil of smoke squeezing us out of our breath and blaring horns seemingly emerging from miraculous, alien-like organs. Here, two legs are fairly good. They are the ones you ride [and not drive]. That relieves you, at least for an hour or a half, of the sedentary lifestyle, which is a major cause of obesity. Moreover, a bicycle is too sober to emit a high-pitched sound like a car horn. On top of all these, it doesn't cloud your city with smoke and dust. So for Dhaka, a city of 20 million people, I'd say \"Two legs good, four legs bad.\" Agree? Avoiding traffic congestion, shortage of public transport, the uncertainty of reaching destinations in time, and riding a cost-effective, environment-friendly, energy-saving and fully-owned vehicle have truly encouraged people to start cycling. To reduce traffic jam and save time, cycling can be the smart solution for Dhaka streets, rather than unfit motor vehicles. It was found in a recent survey that due to traffic congestion, a vehicle can go up to only five kilometres per hour in the capital. Even 12 years ago, this speed was 21 kilometres per hour. Besides, the congestion eats up 5 million work hours annually. The financial loss is about BDT 37,000 crore a year; it's necessary to say that the way traffic congestion is worsening day by day, it will further increase the amount of financial losses. Cyclists are also seen hanging out and forming communities regularly through social media. To keep themselves updated and well-connected, they have formed organisations like BD Cyclists, Dhaka Cycling Club, Mirpur Cyclists, Dhaka-Northern Cyclists, Mohammadpur Cyclists and many more. These organisations encourage people to buy cycles and organise training programmes on how to ride through the traffic. Apart from this, various awareness programmes on the benefits of cycling are arranged too. In addition to cycling, the organisations hold environmental awareness and blood donation drives, and distribute winter clothes and relief supplies among the poor and flood victims. For example, during the Rana Plaza collapse, the cyclists were able to reach the victims with medicine, blood, food, and water within the shortest possible time, braving the capital's severe traffic. Different city-based courier service companies like Pathao and Pick and Drop have proved that it's not very tough to earn extra money if you have a cycle. Now let's talk about the benefits of cycling. Cycling burns calories from the body, eliminates the risk of stroke, reduces diabetes, and helps control blood pressure and hypertension in patients. The risk of cardiovascular diseases decreases by more than 50 percent if one cycles around 35 kilometres per week. One can go anywhere with a bicycle, within reasonable time. There is no waiting for buses and auto-rickshaws; there is no bargaining over fare.  Sadly, the daily experience of those who cycle in Dhaka is very horrible. To them, it is a highly disordered city. According to Traffic Division of Bangladesh Police, many pedestrians in Dhaka lose their lives in road accidents every day. Therefore, it is very important to build separate lanes for cycles. Bangladesh Cycle Lane Implementation Council observed the 7th Cycle Lane Day on April 6 this year demanding separate lanes on the road. On that day, cyclists of different age groups held rallies on the southern side of the Parliament House. In addition to encouraging cycling, they proposed the creation of separate lanes for cyclists for safe riding. As bicycles are environment-friendly rides, many countries around the world have given highest priority to making separate lanes for safe cycling. Citizens of countries like China, Germany, and South Korea are riding bikes, leaving cars in their homes; about half the Danish population in its capital Copenhagen use bicycles as the transport to their workplace. The question arises, is it possible to create a safe environment in cities like Dhaka? We are hopeful. The awareness of people and the construction of the cycle lanes have awakened our hope.

      "text": "Fresh threat is looming over flash flood-affected district of Moulvibazar from the north with the surging Kushiyara River gradually weakening its embankment. Cracks are showing up along the embankment in Sadar's Holdikul area due to the force of water stream. If the dam fails, it might inundate parts of Sylhet and worsen the flood situation in Moulvibazar town and adjacent areas. The Kushiyara is a trans-boundary river, flowing in from northern hills of Assam, entering the Bangladesh through Sylhet's Zakiganj. The Kushiyara and Surma rivers have the same origin point, and Kushiyara merges into the Surma again at Habiganj. Moulvibazar District Councillor Tofael Islam told The Daily Star the flood situation improved in the past two days, but the damages to Kushiyara embankment are growing concerns. Last reported this afternoon, the Kushiyara, was surging 31cm above the danger level at Sherpur point in town, Ronendro Sankar Chakraborty, an executive engineer of local Water Development Board (WDB), told The Daily Star. \"Due to heavy rainfall coupled with onrush of hilly water, the soil under the embankment is eroding, causing the rifts to appear on the embankment,\" he said. Water Development Board, Bangladesh Army and locals are working in arms to repair the rifts of the embankment with the help of timbers and sand sacks. Though such temporary repair is not helping the condition much, they are trying. If the embankment is not repaired soon, it will flood a huge area, worsening the present flood condition in Moulvibazar district, Engr Chowdhury added. The locals are blaming the indifference and negligence of Water Development Board officials behind the failing embankments of Kushiyara River. The prevailing flash flood in Moulvibazar was triggered by the breach in embankments to Monu River. After showing cracks for the previous couple of years, the dam finally collapsed at different points last week. Now, according to District Councillor Tofael Islam, waters of the Monu, Khowai and Dhalai rivers have receded - resulting in retreating flood water in Moulvibazar."

Our Patuakhali Correspondent reports: Two bridges in Mirzaganj and Dumki upazilas, completed three years and one year ago respectively, are lying useless due to lack of its approach roads. In Mirzaganj, Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) built a 9.15-metre-long bridge on Chatra canal at a cost of Tk 19.50 lakh three years ago to ease communication with Mirzaganj upazila town. But local people cannot use the bridge as the approach road has not been made.  In Dumki, LGED built a bridge on Khormatola canal at Jalisha village at a cost of about Tk 25 lakh a year ago to ease communication with Dumki upazila headquarter. \"But we can't use it as its approach road hasn't completed,\" said Md Shahjahan, a local resident. Meanwhile, people of five villages including a good number of schoolchildren are suffering for long as they have to cross a 250-foot-long bamboo bridge on Gorai canal in Patuakhali Sadar upazila for going to school and communicating with the upazila town and the district headquarters. The Gorai canal is situated on the boundary lines of Auliapur, Motherbunia and Morichbunia unions, all under Patuakhali Sadar upazila. At least 150 children of Motherbunia and Morichbunia have to cross the bamboo bridge to go to Pashchim Auliapur Government Primary School and adjacent Auliapur Adarsha High School situated on the east bank of Gorai canal. Md Humayun Kabir, chairman of Auliapur Union Parishad, said they submitted prayer to different authorities including LGED to build a bridge on the canal but no step has been taken. Md Hossen Ali Mir, Patuakhali Sadar upazila engineer of LGED, said, \"We sent a proposal to the higher authority to build a bridge on the canal. If we get allocation we will construct the bridge.\" Our Mymensingh Correspondent reports: Movement of vehicles other than very small ones has virtually stopped on Kalmakanda-Durgapur road in Netrakona as the approach road of Chanduail Bridge got damaged on Friday due to landslide amid heavy rain and huge pressure of water from hills across the border. This is the only road to connect with Kalmakanda and Durgapur upazilas and Netrakona Sadar, locals said. The approach road of the 40-metre-long bridge was in bad shape for months but the authorities concerned did not take any step earlier, said Abul Hossain, a truck driver. Farmers will be seriously affected if the suspension of plying of goods carrying vehicles continues, said Md Saiful Islam, executive member of Kalmakanda upazila Awami League.  Contacted, Kalmakanda upazila LGED engineer Md Haider Ali Miah said, \"For repair of the approach road, a Tk 19 lakh work order was earlier passed. We are pursuing the assigned contractors to start the work soon.\" Our Lalmonirhat Correspondent adds: A bridge over Kumor Dola canal at Dhairkhata village of Lalmonirhat Sadar upzaila's Kulaghat union collapsed during last year's flood but it is yet to be reconstructed. People of Dhairkhata, Shakher Bazar, Madoner Chak, Kodalkhata and Saptana villages use the route for their communication and transporting goods to the district town and other areas.       \"After a month of the bridge collapse in September last year, we set a bamboo bridge there on our own expenditure. We set another new bamboo bridge there in last month,\" said Azizul Islam Aziz, 52, a resident of Shakher Bazar village. \"Now we use the route for communication but we can't use it for transporting agricultural products by vehicles,\" Lutfar Rahman, 45, of the same village said. Kulaghat Union Parishad Chairman Idris Ali said they submitted application to the LGED authority for reconstruction of the bridge. LGED's Lalmonirhat Sadar Upazila Engineer Mokhlesur Rahman said demand note was sent seeking fund to the higher authorities for construction of the bridge."

      "text": "Orange backpacks, with the word \"Sputnique\" on them, made their way to different corners of the country. And somehow, everywhere these backpacks, each weighing about five kilograms, went, they brought significant benefit to those who were able to use them to their fullest potential. But how much potential can one backpack have, one might ask. To answer this question, \"Light of Hope\" made the ultimate solar power-run multimedia solution, ensuring learning through edutainment -- the Sputnique. Sputnique is not simply a backpack. Inside it, one can find an LED projector, a sound box, USB hubs, a power bank, a microphone and a laptop -- everything one might need to hold a successful and entertaining class, training session or workshop, even in the absence of electricity. Institution and organisations can buy the backpacks at the cost of Tk 1-2 lakh, depending on the equipment needed.  With such facilities readily available in a single backpack, organisations and educational institutions can easily conduct multimedia based classes and sessions not only in regular classrooms but in areas that lack electrical support or in flood-affected zones where there is no power. Sputnique comes ready to give all-out technology based support to conduct classes in adverse situations. An education start-up, \"Light of Hope\" was founded by Waliullah Bhuiyan, an EEE graduate from Islamic University of Technology, with an aim to bring significant progress to the country's education system through a sustainable business model. Asked how and why he came up with Sputnique, Waliullah said when he went to Germany for his master's degree in energy and environmental management in 2013, he submitted a project titled \"How to make multimedia classrooms with solar power in schools without power connection\" in a global competition organised by Dell. Bagging the third prize among 816 project applicants, he then began planning on how to use this project in Bangladesh. Waliullah returned in 2014 equipped with his prize money and made multimedia classrooms in Chattogram's Swapnanagar School and Kishoreganj's Parashmoni Shikkha Academy, where there is no power connection. A few days in, Light of Hope then handed over laptops, projectors and other E-learning material to the authorities of both schools. \"The idea of how to place an entire multimedia classroom inside a backpack like Sputnique was executed in 2016 when Sisimpur, the Bangladeshi version of Sesame's Street, came to us with a project proposal, in which they wanted to reach school kids in remote areas with their awareness programme. But it was difficult to move through the narrow village roads with generators, projectors, laptops and sound boxes on rickshaw-vans,\" said Waliullah. That is when Light of Hope took up the challenge and began designing these backpacks with a cause. \"Everything in the backpack is powered by flexible solar panel,\" he said. \"The implementation of the project would have been impossible without the help of my team members -- Maruf, Soheb, Momel, Tripti and Taizul Islam Anik,\" Waliullah added. After Sputnique was ready, Sisimpur bought 10 backpacks. \"After that, we never had to look back,\" Waliullah said. So far, Light of Hope was able to sell 30 backpacks, bringing a change to thousands of lives. \"When we were working on our own project, we turned to Light of Hope to give us a viable solution to our problem. We wanted to take Sisimpur's content to Narsingdi's Raipur upazila, in 112 schools for children aged between three and eight. That is when Light of Hope came up with Sputnique. From the services of the backpack, we took the power back and the LED projector. The power bank provided us with back-up electricity for three hours, where as the projector's light was sufficient to carry out the projects successfully,\" said Gopal Kumar Dey, senior manager (programme, research and M&E), Sisimpur. He further said that, with the help of Sputnique, their project helped benefit almost 40,000 people. Sputnique's speciality lies in its ability to hold multimedia learning sessions with ease and at a lower cost. While it may be difficult and costly to carry projectors and other multimedia equipment to rural areas, Sputnique offers a viable alternative. Waliullah said, \"Trainers and teachers can conduct classes and sessions smoothly as Sputnique's power bank can provide back-up electricity for up to three to six hours.\" Sputnique is already being used in projects in the slums of Rayerbazar by Save the Children and other projects run by various organisations. It has also travelled to the Rohingya Refugee Camps through Jaago Foundation, to support hundreds of children by providing a high-quality, engaging and educational environment, he said. \"We are trying to help traumatised Rohingya children recover by providing them with children's visual content. The screening of the contents, in a place like the camps where electricity in unavailable, would have been impossible for us without the services provided by Sputnique,\" said Mohammad Quamrul Kibria Ayon, Manager of Jaago Foundation. Including 500 Rohingya children, over 70,000 people, especially children, have found a path towards better education and quality training through the invention of one simple backpack."

      "text": "Having just returned from a scoping mission to Cox's Bazar to see the environmental situation both inside and outside the Rohingya camps, I am going to share some thoughts on the immediate and long-term needs from an environmental perspective. Before doing so, I would like to pay tribute to the people and government of Bangladesh as well as the international agencies and NGOs who have managed to handle the immediate humanitarian crisis extremely well under the circumstances. If one were to look at a satellite image of the Cox's Bazar region from early last year, one would see forests in which wild elephants roamed. The same picture today will show a city of over 700,000 people where there was once a forest. This has happened almost within a blink of an eye! However, while the immediate need was to find shelter, provide food and medicine as well as water and sanitation to the incoming Rohingya, the time has come to move from the immediate crisis management stage to a slightly longer-term vision. This needs to be done both within as well as outside the camps. I will describe the major environmental issues and suggest some actions for each one. This is by far the biggest danger looming in the next few months, with the makeshift shelters perched on sloping hills that are most vulnerable to landslide. This is a problem that is quite predictable, and hence needs a priority action plan to be implemented urgently. The elements of such a plan can include relocation of the most vulnerable, improving their housing and drainage conditions, and most importantly, building human resilience to enable the people themselves to be better prepared when the problem inevitably occurs. This is also true for possible cyclones as there are hardly enough cyclone shelters for the local population, let alone for the lakhs of newcomers. Hence, an urgent cyclone and flood preparedness programme needs to be undertaken, drawing on the significant capacity that already exists among the government, its development partners and NGOs. This is the second major problem and consists of the denudation of several thousand hectares of forestland to house the Rohingya in camps as well as the ongoing cutting of trees for firewood for cooking. While the allocation of forestland for the camps could be justified, the ongoing deforestation needs to be addressed, as it is spreading the seeds of environmental degradation well outside the camps also. The immediate need is to identify and supply an alternative fuel source. While more environment-friendly sources should be explored moving forward, the best immediate option may be LPG (as required). One associated problem has been the human settlement on wild elephant trails which has already resulted in a number of deaths by trampling. This needs to be addressed through a more careful allocation of camp areas and fencing to divert the elephants. This is the third most important issue both for supply of drinking water through tube-wells and toilets for defacation. The main challenge is human faecal waste management, which needs to be done more scientifically in \"closed treatment\" rather than \"open treatment.\" I saw a couple of excellent closed faecal waste management systems in Kutupalong camp done by Practical Action. Many more of these are needed urgently to replace the existing open systems that are there now. The final issue is the need to move from an ad hoc crisis management mode of reactive interventions to a more systematic and planned approach. In this regard, I would like to propose setting up of a National Environmental Expert Group with local and international experts who can develop an environmental management plan, and more importantly, monitor it and report to the higher authorities on a regular basis. This can easily be done through platforms like Gobeshona which has already brought together over 50 public and private universities, research institutes and NGOs from Bangladesh and abroad. Such a group should have a mandate to monitor the environment both inside as well as outside the camps. To sum up, while the massive influx of the Rohingya refugees into Cox's Bazaar region was unexpected, the resulting environmental problems are quite predictable, and hence we need to urgently address this issue in a much more systematic and coordinated way. The Bangladeshi scientific community stands ready to do its bit. Saleemul Huq is Director, International Centre for Climate Change and Development at the Independent University, Bangladesh.

We wonder how any civilised people can treat anyone in such a bestial way as our women workers are being treated, particularly in Saudi Arabia from where there has been a flood of returning women workers with sorrowful tales of their stay there in the last several months. And we have written about the nauseating and inhuman behaviour of the employers in this country. We had also cautioned our government, when employment in the Kingdom was resumed in 2015, to ensure all the necessary guarantees for workers going there. Since then, over a lakh women workers have been sent to Saudi Arabia. If anything has changed, it has been for the worst. In this regard, there is much for the employing agencies to do. It must make foolproof terms of contract with the employers for physical and job safety of the workers. And should any of them return home prematurely, particularly because of physical abuse, they must be compensated adequately, although no recompense is enough for the trauma they go through. They should be rehabilitated in appropriate jobs since most of them on return are either deserted by their husbands or divorced. But above everything else, our government should take up the matter strongly with the Saudis that as host country,it should ensure that all the clauses in the agreement are followed and take punitive action against the errant employers. It is high time for the government to reconsider sending women workers to countries where they are not treated as human beings. If at all, women workers should be trained in skilled jobs and employed in countries where there is no chance of physical ill-treatment.  "

      "text": "Sufia Kamal, (June 20, 1911-November 20, 1999), lived a long and eventful life. She not only witnessed great cataclysms in history but played a major role in empowering women in an oppressive society. The life of little Sufia, aged seven months could have been very different, especially after her father, devoted to Sufism, left home in search of divine enlightenment and was never to be seen again. But fate had other plans for the future poet, champion of women's rights, pioneering cultural icon in the Bengali nationalist movement and Liberation War activist. Sufia's young mother had little option but to take her two little children to live at her parents' home in the Shaistabad estate in Barisal. But although the extended family lived in a palatial home with a rich library, studying anything other than the holy scriptures was considered taboo for girls. Sufia was tutored to read and write Bengali by her mother, even though Urdu was spoken in the household. This opened up a whole new world for her and she became an avid reader of literary journals such as Tagore's Probashi with write-ups by Begum Rokeya, Tahera Banu and more. Her life took another turn when at 12 she was married off to her cousin Syed Nehal Hossain, a budding writer. Soon after, Sufia settled down in Barisal. The bustling town gave her a chance to finally emerge from seclusion. She busied herself in social work. She even took part in the non-cooperation movement of Mahatma Gandhi and began to spin cloth with a charka as a mark of protest against the British rulers. Inspired by her husband, she authored a short story \"Sainik Badhu\" and a few poems which were published in a literary journal. But these small steps at emancipation attracted the ire of her relatives as they went against the norms of Muslim aristocracy at the time. Despite the challenges, Sufia came in contact with literary giants, social reformists and educationists including Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam, and Mohammad Nasiruddin, (editor of Saowgat), who was not only keen about politics but also about women's emancipation. She began to write for Saowgat. She briefly came in contact with Rokeya Sakhawat's social organisation that stood for women's freedom. Begum Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain had made great contributions to society by devoting her life to making education accessible for Muslim girls. Slowly the societal perception of women started changing in urban areas. But just as Sufia was starting her work as a writer and social activist, her life took yet another turn. Her husband died of tuberculosis in 1932 and shortly afterwards a flood destroyed her grandparents' palatial estate. A widow at 21 with a six-year-old daughter, Sufia Kamal was compelled to move to Calcutta (now Kolkata). With no formal education, her back to the wall, Sufia Kamal took a bold decision. She became a school teacher at the Calcutta Corporation on a meagre salary of 50 rupees. But within a year, conservative society was up in arms against her. Even her family publicly denounced her close association with literary personalities. But such barriers only pushed her to become a crusader against such imbalances in society. Her poetry reflected both her struggles and her convictions. In 1937, her first book, Keyar Kanta (The Thorn of Flowers), a collection of short stories, was published. The following year, her poetry collection, Sanjer Maya (The Twilight Illusion) was published. In spite of the popularity of the books, depression engulfed her. At this juncture, she got married to Kamaluddin Khan. He was a liberal and educated young man who became a great supporter of her literary and social pursuits. It was at this time she changed her surname to Kamal. The 1940s were turbulent times in the history of undivided India and communal riots flared up frequently. Sufia Kamal worked at a temporary shelter camp set up at Lady Brabourne College during the 1946 riot in Calcutta. In those difficult times, her belief in humanitarian work strengthened, and she became a fierce opponent of societal division along communal lines. Immediately after Partition in 1947, Sufia Kamal moved to Dhaka, the capital of erstwhile East Pakistan. She lived in an orphanage where she came in touch with legendary revolutionary Leela Roy, a close associate of Indian nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose. Sufia Kamal founded the Peace Committee to rehabilitate victims of communal riots and maintain Hindu-Muslim harmony. Sufia Kamal took active part in the 1952 Language Movement and was at the forefront of many protest movements. Meanwhile, Mohammad Nasiruddin relocated Saowgat's offices to Dhaka. He continued the publication of Begum, the first weekly magazine for women, where unsurprisingly Sufia Kamal was one of the earliest editors. Sufia Kamal played an active role in organising the annual literary conferences that provided a major platform for liberals to come together in the 1950s. Kanchi-Kanchar Ashor, an organisation for children's cultural and educational development, was also founded by her. During the birth centenary of Tagore in 1961, the Pakistan government tried to derail the celebrations as they considered Tagore an ideological misfit in Pakistan. Sufia Kamal and her fellow workers resisted and formed the National Committee to conduct the celebrations with her at the helm. She also founded Chhayanaut, a cultural organisation, which gradually became the iconic centre for promoting Bengali culture. In 1969 she founded Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, which is now the largest women's organisation in Bangladesh. She remained its president till her last days and inspired women all over the country to stand up for their rights. Sufia Kamal led the way through sheer courage in many other instances. Whenever the authorities imposed any black law curtailing civil liberties, she was at the forefront of the protest. Once General Ayub Khan, the military ruler of Pakistan, remarked at a meeting that laypeople are like beasts and as such, not fit to be given franchise. Sufia Kamal at once stood up and protested, \"If the people are beasts then as the President of the Republic, you are the king of the beasts.\" During the Liberation War, she took great risks to help the Freedom Fighters with medicine and money. She did not adhere to any political party's philosophy--her only motivation was her devotion to humanism and a fairer society. Less than three weeks after the independence of Bangladesh, Sufia Kamal along with Badrunnessa Ahmed, MP of the Awami League, took up cudgels to rehabilitate women war victims of 1971. Together they set up Bangladesh's Central Women's Rehabilitation Centre on January 7, 1972. A deeply concerned Sufia Kamal sought the advice of Mother Teresa on the vital issue of children born to captive women during the war. She stood up for their rights and worked relentlessly for their adoption and rehabilitation. She continued her work on the other great battle front of women's rights. To her it stood for the liberation of humanity. This gained momentum under her leadership. Gradually, the association gained momentum and spread to the grassroots level. She organised international assistance and legal assistance for women and won the trust of men and women alike. Her struggle for a society free of disparity, and her ideologies earned her over 50 awards including the Ekushey Padak, Swadhinata Padak and Bangla Academy Padak. Despite her uncompromising stance on social values, she was seen as a humble and deeply religious person. A frail figure in her later life, she was seldom seen in anything other than a white sari, her head covered and always an expression imbued with intellect and humanism. Although her father had left her side at an early age, she seems to have followed him in Sufi traditions in standing against the wave of hatred and intolerance. Her name--Sufia--seems to be a derivation of the belief that devotion and sincerity of purpose can be an indomitable force for the service of humanity.

Now it is being choked with waste and plastics,\" sixty-year-old Siraj Mia, a local, said, spitting on the ground. 15 years ago, the area had no incidents of water-logging. \"Now a little rain submerges the whole area and it is all because of indiscriminate dumping of household wastes and plastic in the water body. It has become the breeding ground for mosquitoes,\" Siraj said. As more products wrapped in plastic are being sold, the use of the synthetic has increased.  And the major impact of plastic bags in Bangladesh is seen in the storm water drainage systems. Due to the unchecked and improper disposal of plastic, drains and sewerage systems have become blocked and resulted in increase incidences of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria. \"Due to huge accumulation of polythene in the water beds, the whole drainage system of Dhaka collapses frequently. The situation is so bad that frequent cleaning up of the drainages and canals could not bring any respite for us,\" Iqbal Habib, joint secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (BAPA), told The Daily Star. He said the most dangerous result of indiscriminate dumping of plastic was the heavy accumulation of polythene in the soil which has created a false layer acting as a barrier between the soil and water. \"If any earthquake happens, the lower part of the Dhaka city will collapse.\" \n Durability, flexibility, lightweight nature and a cheaper price have attracted consumers in buying more plastic products. Plastic is also suitable for creating a container for almost any item. Once the product is consumed, the plastic container is discarded improperly, harming the environment.    According to the non-governmental organisation, Environment and Social Development Organization-ESDO, in 1989 almost 70 percent of the country and more than 90 percent of Dhaka was submerged during the monsoon season due to plastic bags clogging drains and waterways. \"Drainage systems blocked  by  plastic  bags  have  been  identified  as  a  major  cause of flooding in Bangladesh during monsoon season. Following the 1998 flood, it was estimated that up to 80% of the city's water logging was caused by polythene blocking the drains,\" Shahriar Hossain, Secretary General of ESDO, said. Different raw materials were used in producing different kinds of plastic products with all becoming sources for plastic waste. And plastic--the synthetic material--has left harmful imprints on the environment and human health. Currently, Bangladesh generates around 381.36 tonnes of plastic waste every day while around 249.86 tonnes is going to the landfill, according to a report of the NGO Waste Concern, the largest waste management and recycling company in Bangladesh. Iftekhar Enayetullah, director of Waste Concern, said usage of plastics was increasing in Bangladesh but the recycling industry was not yet interested in recycling plastic waste as it was not fiscally attractive for them. \"The government should take steps to ensure source separation and incentives for recyclers while private organisations should be encouraged to come forward to resolve the crisis,\" he said, adding that green products should be promoted. Visiting the Rupnagar canal in Mirpur, it was seen that it had almost vanished and a thin layer of blackish polluted water could be seen. Locals said indiscriminate dumping of huge quantity of waste resulted in severe waterlogging. \"During monsoon, almost all the roads go under water as most of the canal and its branches are clogged with wastes. Water-logging is now a common scenario in the area,\" Abdul Hakim, a 50-year old businessman, told this correspondent. He said the slow death of the canal began in 1991 and now it was almost dead. The canal gives a passage to wastewater as well as rainwater from West Shewrapara, Kazipara, Monipur, Mirpur, Rupnagar, Duaripara and Alokdi into the Turag River. Visiting the Mohammadpur area, it was found that Ramchandrapur canal turns into a regular garbage dumping ground for the locals residents. Water is stagnant due to accumulation of waste. The canal waste includes non-degradable materials like polyethylene, which deteriorates environmental condition. Quazi Sarwar Imtiaz Hashmi, additional director general of the Department of Environment, said, \"Human behavior is mainly responsible for polythene pollution. We regularly conduct drives against polythene but it is not possible to contain the use of polythene by launching drives.\" He also said there was no alternative to generating mass awareness against use of polythene and its adverse impact the on environment."

      "text": "A large number of commuters in different districts are suffering as a few damaged bridges are lying without repair. A part of the Nolka Bridge near Bangabandhu Multi-purpose Bridge got damaged last week, causing suspension of movement of heavy vehicles there, reports our Pabna correspondent. \"After knowing about the damage of the Nolka Bridge on Friday night, we asked the drivers of heavy vehicles, especially loaded trucks, to use the roads through Sirajganj town to reach Bangabandhu Bridge,\" said Rafikul Islam Bhuiya, officer-in-charge of Banagabandhu Bridge West Zone Police Station. The area sees huge traffic jam as other vehicles including passenger buses have to move very slowly on the Bangabandhu Bridge link road, he said. \"The bridge turned risky as heavy vehicles including loaded trucks started using the bridge after opening of Bangabandhu Bridge in 1998,\" he said. Some 500 to 600 vehicles move on this road in each hour every day because it serves as the most convenient link of Dhaka with 24 districts after opening of bridge over the Jamuna, he added. Md Ahad Ullah, executive engineer of Sirajganj Roads and Highways Department, said, \"A portion of the bridge got damaged due to displacement of earth from the basement of a pillar. We have set sandbags for its protection. Bridge experts visited the spot and repair work is likely to resume soon.\" Our Lalmonirhat Correspondent reports: A bridge over the Ratnai river on Lalmonirhat-Mogholhat road in Lalmonirhat Sadar upazila's Durakuti area faces the risk of collapse as three of its four girders are vulnerable. \"For the last ten years, four local farmers have continued farming on around 15 bighas of land in the riverbed after earth-filling it. It has turned the main water course of the Ratnai river into a zigzag channel, affecting the bridge's three girders,\" said Akkel Ali, 43, a farmer at Durakuti village. A warning sign forbids movement of heavy vehicles on the risky concrete bridge over Napitkhali canal on Kawkhali-Swarupkathi road in Pirojpur's Nesarabad upazila. Photo: Star\n Atiar Rahman, 56, a businessman at Mogholhat Bazar in Lalmonirhat Sadar upazila, said, they have to transport goods on light vehicles as the bridge over the Ratnai river is not usable for loaded trucks. Executive Engineer of Roads and Highways Department (RHD) in Lalmonirhat Ali Noorayen said, \"A design of a new bridge over the Ratnai river on Lalmonirhat-Mogholhat road was sent to the higher authorities for approval two months ago. After its approval, we will make an estimate to float tender for work.\" \"I will inform the local administration for taking step to free the riverbed from grabbers to minimize the risk to the bridge,\" he said. Meanwhile, around two thousand people of three villages are suffering as the bamboo bridge over Kalikura canal is lying unused after its approach was damaged during last year's flood at Kalikura village of Chalbala union in Kaliganj upazila. Local Government Engineering Department's Kaliganj Upazila Engineer Parvez Newaz Khan said the approach road of the bamboo bridge will be repaired before the rainy season if fund is allocated. Our Pirojpur Correspondent reports: A concrete bridge on Kawkhali-Swarupkathi road over Napitkhali canal in Jalabari union of Nesarabad upazila under the district has become risky for vehicles. The RHD has set two signboards on both sides of the bridge, prohibiting movement of heavy vehicles as parts of the bridge broke and subsided two years ago. Every day around 20 buses and over 200 of different small sized vehicles cross the road, said Bellal Hossain, a local. \"We cross Napitkhali Bridge amid anxiety as it is very weak and shaky,\" said Alamgir Hossain, a driver of a bus plying the route. Hamidur Rahman, sub-assistant engineer of Pirojpur RHD office, said they will repair the Napitkhali Bridge within a short time. Another small bridge on the same road has also become risky."

      "text": "The city residents saw their living costs go up by 8.44 percent last year compared to that in the previous year, it said. The voluntary organisation urged the government to form a separate wing or division under the Prime Minister's Office or the commerce ministry to keep prices of 12-15 essentials within the reach of the low-income and poor families. \"Most of the people were deprived of the fruits of the country's overall development because of the price hike of essentials, including rice, in 2017. Many people are suffering due to high food prices. Savings of many families are falling. An urgent remedy is necessary,\" CAB President Ghulam Rahman said while presenting the CAB report on living cost in 2017 at the Dhaka Reporters Unity. Living cost of the two crore city dwellers hit the highest since 2014 when it rose by 6.82 percent, according to the CAB. The CAB report is based on price data on 114 food items and 22 everyday products collected from 15 markets in the capital. It also took into account the prices of 14 services, including gas, electricity and water. The report, however, did not include the education and health expenses of the city residents. Earlier in 2013, the cost of living had shot up by 11 percent compared to that in the previous year because of increase in the prices of fish, spices, rice, pulses, onion, electricity and petroleum, said the CAB. Prof Shamsul Alam, energy adviser to the CAB, said around 12 crore of the country's 16 crore people earn $2 a day, and price hike of essentials seriously affected the lives of this section of the population who represents the low-income and poor people. \"The soaring cost shows lack of competition in the market, high profit motive, corruption and extortion in almost every stage of the supply chain of commodities,\" he said at the press conference. The CAB said the average price of rice soared by 20.4 percent in 2017 -- the highest since 2011 -- from that a year ago. And prices of coarse rice rose higher than that of fine rice. Architect and CAB's complaint cell convener Mubasshar Hussain said the increase in prices of coarse rice has hit the poor and low-income people hard.  The CAB noted that rice millers and big traders hiked prices of the staple, cashing in on flood-induced losses of crops and depleting stockpile at public granaries last year. They would not have got the scope for increasing prices by creating an artificial supply shortage if the government had built adequate stocks of rice, said the consumer rights organisation. Onion saw the highest price hike last year, followed by other vegetables, household gas, rice, liquid milk and beef. Besides, house rent soared by 8.14 percent and electricity by 6.44 percent in 2017 from that a year ago. However, prices of some items such as lentil, egg and potato fell last year compared to that in the previous year. Referring to the hike of gas and electricity prices by the government, it said, \"The CAB thinks the decision to increase prices was not logical and justified.\" Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission increased the electricity price in November, and the new rate became effective from December last year.   On transport, the CAB said there was no mentionable improvement in public transport last year. It also mentioned that healthcare facilities have increased but questions still remain about the quality and costs of healthcare. The report also touched on the issue of repeated leaks of question papers of various examinations last year. The CAB noted that Bangladesh's economy is growing more than 7 percent annually and per capita income has exceeded $1,600. The number of poor people has also declined remarkably. Yet, around two crore people are still suffering from poverty, said the non-profit organisation. \"There is no alternative to keeping the prices of essentials within the reach of the poor,\" added the CAB president.

      "text": "A Pakistani court yesterday handed four death sentences to a man charged with raping and murdering a six-year-old girl, in a case that shocked the country and sparked major riots in his home district. Imran Ali, 24, was on trial for killing Zainab Fatima Ameen in the eastern city of Kasur last month. He faces further charges in the cases of at least seven other children attacked in the Punjab city -- five of whom were murdered -- in a spate of assaults that had stoked fears a serial child killer was on the loose. He has confessed to all eight attacks, including the death of Zainab. Ali was handed four separate death sentences after being convicted of the rape and murder of Zainab, as well as terrorism charges, prosecutor general of Punjab province Ihtesham Qadir said after a special anti-terrorism court passed its judgement. Under Pakistani law, crimes that are considered to have spread terror in society can be charged as acts of terrorism. The prosecutors said he also received life imprisonment and fines totalling 3.2 million rupees ($30,000) for additional charges of hiding his victim's body. One million rupees of the fine would be given in compensation to Zainab's family, public prosecutor Abdul Rauf Wattoo told AFP. The trial was held in Lahore's Kot Lakhpat prison under tight security. Journalists were stopped 500 metres (yards) from the prison and only relatives of the victim were allowed in court for the hearing. Zainab's mother Nusrat Bibi demanded he be executed in public. \"I want him to be hanged publicly at the place where he took Zainab,\" she told reporters after the verdict. Zainab's murder last month sparked outrage across Pakistan, with riots erupting in Kasur as thousands swarmed police stations and set fire to politicians' homes, while Pakistanis across the nation took to social media demanding action. Television stations repeatedly broadcast chilling CCTV footage purportedly showing the young girl walking hand-in-hand with an unidentified male in what may have been her last moments. The killing sparked calls for the public execution of Ali after officials said his DNA had been recovered from the scene of the crime and matched samples from similar cases. At least 12 cases of rape and murder have been recorded in the Kasur area in the past two years. Ali confessed to eight cases, but it is not clear if the four others are linked. According to the victim's father Ameen Ansari, Ali -- who lived nearby -- had taken part in the initial protests that erupted after Zainab's body was discovered. Prior to the recent flood of cases, Kasur was already infamous for sexual abuse, after authorities uncovered a huge paedophilia ring in the city in 2015."

      "text": "I went to Chattagram to celebrate Eid with my family. It took me two hours and a half to reach home from the city's Shah Amanat International Airport. The distance was about 10 miles. I was jubilant to reach home quicker than what I was anticipating. My sister-in-law took over four hours the previous day. This is the state of affairs in Chattagram. While a lot of road \"beautification\" goes on in the city--for instance, a bizarre heat-producing concrete wave near the airport on the road median--the road itself is literally hell. People pray for enduring the punishing traffic congestion near the Export Processing Zone! The journey from the airport to the city is one example of why Chattagram today seems like an orphaned city. Going around Porto Grande--as the Portuguese once called it for its strategic maritime location--one feels that nobody cares one bit about this city, neither the central government, nor the local. The city has no \"parents\" to take care of it, no guardians to champion its promises. The city seems hopelessly abandoned. Is it destined to die a slow, painful death? Here is an example from the orphaned city. The mayor recently said: It is not the responsibility of the Chittagong City Corporation (CCC) to fix the city's waterlogging problem, but we would be happy to help out whoever tries to solve the crisis. How benevolent! When the mayor makes such a statement, it should raise a huge red flag. The city's real crisis is the lack of leadership, exacerbated by a weak civil society. Consider the city's perennial waterlogging problem. Nobody seems to have a genuine desire to solve it. The most devastating waterlogging in Chittagong of recent times, in June 2014, should have been a wake-up call. The submerged areas of Bakalia, Chawkbazar, Agrabad, Halishahar, Kapasgola, Chandgaon, Shulakbahar, Bahaddarhat and Probartak intersection became a climate-change icon around the world. But we know that we can't blame it on global warming and excessive rain alone. It is also a spectacular failure of the city's urban administration, or rather its absence. Four thousand years ago, the Indus Valley Civilisation probably had a better water management system! Chattagram continues to go underwater even after moderate rain. And, the authorities in charge of the city's water management--CWASA, CCC, Bangladesh Water Development Board, Chittagong Port Authority, and Chittagong Development Authority--blame each other and shirk their responsibilities. Despite the five-stage Chittagong Storm Water Drainage and Flood Control Master Plan 1995, proposed for the period 1995-2015, the city today appears to have no plan whatsoever. Even if there is one, there is no real change on the ground. The problem is that we don't think holistically and proactively. We just don't do it as a nation. We do reactive planning. There is a problem, and we try to come up with a solution. Rearguard planning often fails because the problematic urban DNA has already been set. For instance, in 1961, the first master plan for Chattagram was proposed with emphasis mostly on zoning maps for housing and industries, with very little consideration for drainage planning. And, since then, drainage planning has been developed, without any integration with ongoing land-use planning, and often as a reactive solution when waterlogging started to become Chattagram's constant urban problem. Politically-driven ad hoc planning made the city into a permanent band-aid urban agglomeration. Blaming budget constraints is a popular excuse. But the real problem is nobody is owning up to the city's problems. Let's again use the \"parent\" metaphor. Would a parent wait to see who put his or her child in danger? The fact is that if the child is in danger he/she must be saved and protected before anything else. The self-proclaimed nagar pitas seem more eager to transform the city into a giant supermarket--market, market everywhere! While visiting the old town recently, I wondered: What does it take to restore the Chaktai canal, the backbone of the port city's drainage system? While the city fails to revive its life-sustaining canal network, Chittagong City Corporation is happily building a mega-swimming pool (with paid membership?), sacrificing the once-picturesque outer stadium in Kajir Dewri, next to MA Aziz Stadium. The green outer stadium used to be Chittagong's identity-shaping maidan, a sort of city centre where generations of kids played football and cricket. Thus, memories abound here. Like many other kids, I, too, learned how to play cricket in the outer stadium. Once Chattagram's famous outdoor eatery, Darul Kabab used to be located in the adjacent green patch in front of the Circuit House. That green disappeared too, because nagar pitas decided that a kitschy shishu park was the most urgent necessity for the city! If you visit the area today, it feels like a war zone: the battle to occupy every square inch of land with buildings, shops, dumpsters, noise, and greed. There is no polis, only people, chaos, congestion, and the spectre of disaster. What did this city of rich history, unique geography, and immense tourism potentials do to deserve this state of despair? The uniqueness of its land-water topography, its historic origin, its local dialect, its multi-faith social amalgamation, its history of anti-British movement, its Porto Grande global attraction through the ages--all remind us today how we have failed this city. Would we think for a second how the Chinese traveller poet Hsuan Tsang's 7th-century depiction of the city as \"a sleeping beauty emerging from mists and water\" was a reference to Chittagong's hilly idyll? Where are the hills today? These days we learn about the city's hills only when landslide kills the urban poor living in shacks at their foot or when the powerful land-mafia flatten them. What went wrong? What did Chattagram do to deserve this? With a population of about eight  million, Chattagram is Bangladesh's second largest city, and the main sea port of Bangladesh. The city hosts about 9.4 percent of the country's urban population and nine percent of urban economic establishments. The port city enables about 75 percent of the country's total exports and 80 percent of total imports. Its GDP contribution is about 12 percent. Yet, about 30 percent waste in the city remains uncollected. Streets stink and the city quite literally becomes a \"smellscape.\" We can't expect to attract foreign investment in a city where garbage rots on streets for days. CWASA supplies only about 40 percent of the city's water need. Only about two percent of waste is recycled. Have you seen a functional traffic light in Chattagram recently? I haven't. Does this sound like the \"financial capital\" of the country? The problem is not that we don't have technical solutions or financial means. We do. We have technical examples from other countries that worked. Let's not forget that we are now building a tunnel under the Buriganga River. The real problem is leadership. Chattagram lacks city leaders who would go to bed at night thinking about a problem and wake up thinking about the same problem. This is the type of passionate ownership of a problem that leads to solutions. Unless somebody owns up to the problem, the city will continue to degenerate. This is where Anisul Haque seemed like a new type of urban leader in Bangladesh. We need serious city leadership in Chattagram and a vocal civil society.

      "text": "A 200-metre stretch of an embankment of the Water Development Board (WDB) was washed away in Southkhali union of Sarankhola upazila yesterday. Moreover, huge cracks have developed in at least 10 points within one and a half kilometres of the embankment from Bogi Bazar to Gabtala Bazar area. During high tide, water enters through the breaches on the embankment built under the Coastal Embankment Improvement Project (CEIP) funded by the World Bank. As a result, cropland, houses, fish enclosures and ponds in the area are flooded on a regular basis. Locals alleged that the WDB authorities had given priority to less vulnerable points of the embankment and neglected the more vulnerable ones near the Baleshwar river. Southkhali Union Parishad Chairman Mozammel Hossain said, ''In order to make the 63-kilometre-long embankment sustainable in the Sidr and Aila affected areas, a Chinese company named CHWE started work on January 26, 2016 at a cost of around Tk 300 crore.  ''However, they did not work much in the 20km risky areas of Bogi, Gabtala, North Southkhali, South Southkhali and Rayenda sections of Sarankhola upazila,\" he added. The UP chairman expressed his frustration at the project saying they did not see much hope from it. Upazila Nirbahi Officer Lincoln Biswas said, \"The authorities have been asked to take immediate action to protect the embankment.\" Engineer Shyamal Dutta of CEIP said they were working in other points as the embankment was strong in Bogi and Gabtala Bazar areas at the beginning of the project. As the embankment experienced a collapse, they have been trying to protect the areas by building ring dams and using soil sacks on an urgent basis, he added."

      "text": "Creating one's Sims would be taken to a whole new level. The natural physical frame of the males would come with a paunch with changeable sizes. The wardrobe collection would include lungi and panjabi. For the female Sims, the player would have to avail the option \"desensitise the neighbourhood\" before giving it any look he wills. If this prerequisite is not fulfilled, every time the Sim is donned with a \"modern\" look, a bubble would pop up by default with the message \"manush ki bolbe?\" The language of Sims, Simlish, would obviously be discarded and replaced with 'Banglish' and subdivided into Sylheti and Chatgaiya accents for enhancement.  A variety of remarkable characters would be introduced in the Bangladeshi edition. For starters, the professional and expensive housemaid in its black and white afternoon uniform would be replaced by \"Jorina'r Ma\" clad in a saree who would reign alone in the neighbourhood, haggling for higher salary every other week. She would never mind her own business and along with the other female Sims of the house, Jorina'r Ma would gather around the television to watch a series based on a mother in law-daughter in law feud at 7 pm, every day. To generate the spooky effect, instead of the grim reaper, a few jinns would be added who would possess the Sims family from time to time. A few trespassers would also be included in this package who would pee on the lawns and go about their business. An integral circle of characters known as \"the bhabi group\" would be developed. They would be the unwanted visitors, spying on the families in the hood and being aggressively indiscreet about all the gossip that they pick up. This group would infest the house under any occasion and complain about the food. During birthdays, the group would arrive with wedding proposals as they would disapprove an aging Sim who is single.  NEXT LEVEL WEDDINGS\n All the Sims would only have one motive, that is, to save up as much ''Simoleon'' as possible in order to throw the most ostentatious wedding party. Every time a character would get invited to a wedding, he or she would also be able to avail the option of \"attend the holud\". This option would require the Sim to go for dance rehearsals every other day to ultimately perform a synchronized group dance with other Sims at the holud, to violent Bollywood beats. The saved Simoleon would get reduced to zilch once the wedding ceremony is done with. No longer would the Sims just swivel around in their wedding costumes and politely begin their new relationship. There would be days of preparation leading up to the big day and the clothes for the special occasion would arrive in a dala. The houses would be decorated with the brightest fairy lights. All the quintessential formalities of a typical Bengali wedding would be implemented into the game which would finally accumulate to one thing: endless dawat. These lunch or dinner gatherings would follow even after the wedding ceremony.  CHILDREN WOULD BE A BIGGER DEAL THAN PETS\n Unlike in The Sims, where the adolescents are treated like mere pets with no prominent function of their own, in this version, they would have crucial life-and-death roles to play, which would be getting admitted to the most prestigious public Sims University. The young Sims would be given the options of beginning school with either an English or Bengali medium starting kit. The parents would be able to engage with the kids in only one way, which would be by screaming \"porte bosho\". In case, they fail to do so, instead of being sent to the military school like it's done in the original game, they would be married off. This part of the game would activate the bhabi group to its full potential. The original Sims held a maximum number of ten houses in the residential area but here it would be a completely different scenario. The buildings would be crammed together adding up to at least a hundred, with the traffic being visible from the very front door. Instead of snow, there would be monsoon season which would cause flood in the area and the cars in the gridlock would all be submerged. The incorporations and changes do not end here. Starting from the inclusion of new festivals to new furniture, the whole Sims world would be turned upside down. However, the most significant modification would be the addition of \"adda at Star Kabab\" to the option tree at social gatherings.   Iqra suffers from wanderlust, dreams of discovering the Loch Ness Monster and occasionally complains about Economics.

Locals said thousands of people, including students in the upazila and Fenchuganj upazila of Sylhet, need to use the road every day, overcoming serious problems. The suffering of critical patients is beyond description when they have to go district headquarters. On a recent visit to the site, this correspondent found a number of potholes on the road. In some places more than 90% of the road had collapsed, creating big ditches. CNG autorickshaw driver Md Sheful Ahmad told this correspondent that he takes students and passengers up to the broken section but does not cross it for fear of damage to his vehicle. Darach Mia of Shasarkandi village said most of the two-kilometre-long Rasulganj-Shasarkandi road collapsed during the flood in 2017, and the carpeting was washed away. Since June in 2017, the water level in Hakaluki haor has risen and many places on the road have become submerged, he said. Shimul Mia, a trader of Shasarkandi bazar, said accidents occur regularly and many vehicle owners have stopped operating on the road to avoid damage to their vehicles. Bhukshimoil Union Parishad member Hossain Khan said people of Barkkuri, Kamaura, Bhatera union, Naogaon, Shasarkandi, Bhukshimoil union, Sylhet, Brahmanbazar and Moulvibazar use this road. He contacted the union parishad chairman and everyone gave assurance that the road will be repaired, Hossain said, adding that no action has been taken in14 months. The roads have been so badly damaged that there is no scope for the villagers to repair it, he said. \"The road connects Bhatera union with Bhukshimoil union. I have erected bamboo fencing on different parts of the road to protect it from waves, but to no avail,\" said Bhukshimoil Union Parishad Chairman Azizur Rahman. The road has become unfit for vehicular movement due to lack of repair, he added. \"We tried to protect the road with sand-filled sacks, but it could not be saved. This road will require site protection,\" said Kulaura upazila Local Government Engineering Department Deputy-Assistant Engineer Shariful Haque."

      "text": "This year though, Matindra is relaxed. He does not need to wait for farm labourers to harvest the paddy anymore owing to his combine harvester. The shift towards automation is dramatically changing the farming scenario in the country. During the flood, the 66-year old could not harvest paddy from two acres of land due to the dearth of workers even after he had paid Tk 10,000, forty-three percent higher than the usual rate, to harvest crop from each acre. Helplessly, he saw his hard work wash away. This year though, he is no longer powerless. \"This [the combine harvester] gives me a lot of strength. I will be able to harvest my ripen paddy even if water comes,\" Matindra said over phone. With the machine, paddy on each bigha (33 decimal) could be harvested in less than one and a half hours, whereas 7-8 hours would be required if the same amount of land is harvested by five people, he said. Matindra bought the combine harvester in May last year, frustrated by the lack of farmhands. As more local workers move away from the agricultural industry, the wages of the remaining ones have risen. However, now Matindra has another option besides manual labour. Even for tilling his land, he can avail tractors and power tillers from rental service providers.  The same service is also available for threshing grain. After using the combine harvester, he will have to hire workers for seeding and transplanting the 12 acre he owns. \"Machines have made farming convenient. It saves our time and money,\" said the member of the 1.51 crore farm families, who are gradually switching to fully mechanised cultivation in the face of spiraling wages. Today, up to 95 percent of land is tilled by power tillers and tractors. Machines are also used for 90 percent of pesticide applications. Most of the grains, particularly rice, are threshed by machines, according to estimates by the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE). On the other hand, further expansion of mechanised means for seeding, transplanting and harvesting has been slow owing to a lack of machines that are suitable for the many different types of land, fragmented ownership, limited use and relatively higher prices, said some farmers and a senior official of a farm machinery marketer. Some one percent of transplanting and harvesting is done by machines, according to the DAE, which also estimates that a farmer would require Tk 8,000 if he manually harvests and threshes crops from one acre of land. The cost will decline to Tk 3,000 per acre if a combine harvester is used. Use of a combine harvester will facilitate farmers in harvesting and threshing crops in six hours compared to 128 hours when the same is done manually. Use of rice transplanter will help growers save Tk 5,000 and 74 hours on each acre, estimates the DAE. Refayet Ullah, a farmer at Pirgacha of Rangpur, said the use of machines has allowed them to cultivate crops timely and at a reduced cost. \"As a result, we can all cultivate in almost the same time and crops remain less prone to disease,\" he said, \"Yields have also increased.\" Refayet said he rents a power tiller for Tk 600 to prepare 22 decimal of land. \"In my locality there are four power tiller rental services. Therefore, the price is affordable.\" To irrigate the fields he pays Tk 1000 per 22 decimal a season. He said combine harvester would be beneficial for them. But its price is too high for farmers to bear as the use of the machine is limited to one month in a season, adding that the cost of a combine harvester currently stands at Tk 8-9 lakh. The government should take steps to reduce the cost of farm machinery, he said. Wali Ullah, a farmer in Ujirpur of Barisal, said the use of animals for tilling has come down to almost nil because of increased use of power tillers and tractors. \"We still harvest paddy manually as large harvesting machines are not suitable as the land is swampy here. Reaper is also not becoming popular as we have to hire workers to transport harvested paddy to the yards,\" he said. Rafiqul Islam, a farmer at Lalmonirhat, a bordering district in the northwest, said reapers are not becoming popular as growers have to hire workers to transport harvested crop. As a result, cost almost becomes equal the expenses for manual harvesting, he added.   \"None wants to leave straw in the field. This is valuable as it is used for cattle feed,\" he said. Saiful Islam, a farmer at Kotchandpur upazila of Jhenidah, said the use of machines in farm operations, particularly for tilling and threshing, has enabled him to bag three crops a year because of reduction in turnaround time. \"With the tractor, we can till land just after harvesting crop. This was not possible when we prepared lands manually with draught animals,\" he said. \"We grow more today than in the past. But it is sad that we do not get fair prices,\" said Saiful. Md Monjurul Alam, professor of Farm Power and Machinery at the Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) said mechanised cultivation reduces time and labour by 30 percent.  Use of machines for seeding and fertilizer application also saves seeds and fertilizer, he added. As less time is required for cultivation, use of machines also helps increases cropping intensity by 20 percent, he said citing a 2006 study. \"Mechanisation has played a big role in increasing cropping intensity in recent years,\" said Monjurul. \"As a whole, production increases by 15 percent.\" Sheikh Md Nazim Uddin, project director of farm mechanisation project phase-II under the Ministry of Agriculture, said mechanisation also helps reduce handling losses.  Subrata Ranjan Das, executive director of ACI Motors, a concern of ACI Ltd, said mechanisation is needed to attract the young generation to farming. \"They will not do everything manually,\" he said. He said mechanisation has expanded mainly because of growth of the rental service market. \"Given average farm land holding of 25 decimal, this is not feasible for a farmer to buy all equipments to mechanise farming,\" he said, suggesting provision of easy and low cost loans for rental service providers. Use of combine harvester remains at a trial and error phase and fragmented land ownership, lack of drainage system and absence of roads in the crop fields slows adoption of the technology, he said. \"Equipment, depending on the environment of every area, should be introduced to increase pace of mechanisation.\" In 2009, the government took up a Tk 150 crore scheme to speed up farm mechanisation by offering 25 percent subsidy for agricultural machineries such as power tillers, tractors, power threshers and combine harvesters, according to DAE. Later, the project was extended till June 2019 and the government raised the subsidy to farmers for purchase of agriculture machinery to 50 percent in two phases. The amount of subsidy was raised to 70 percent in January last year. Matindra bought the small combine harvester by paying Tk 2.14 lakh and the rest was borne by the government. During the immediate aman harvesting season, he used the machine to harvest paddy on 20 acres. He is waiting to use the machine to harvest the boro paddy by the end of April. \"The crop so far looks good,\" he said."

As of February 9, imports of the grain stood at 28.90 lakh tonnes in contrast to 1.33 lakh tonnes brought in to the country in fiscal 2016-17, according to data from the food ministry. Of the amount, private traders brought in 21.29 lakh tonnes and the government 7.61 lakh tonnes. The last time higher quantities of rice was imported was back in fiscal 1998-99, when 30.08 lakh tonnes arrived from abroad. And as of January 27 this year, letters of credit have been opened to import 37.55 lakh tonne of rice. The buoyancy in imports continues even though farmers are cultivating boro after harvesting aman paddy, the production of which is estimated by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to fall due to the three-day-long unseasonal heavy rain in December. The US agency in a report last week raised its forecast on Bangladesh's rice import to 34 lakh tonnes of rice in 2017-18, which is more than double its earlier prediction of 16 lakh tonnes in November last year. \"The private importers are aggressively taking the maximum benefit of a 2 percent tariff rate,\" said the USDA Foreign Agriculture Service in its January issue of the Grain and Feed Update on Bangladesh. The report said private sector imports have soared due to higher prices in the local market amid fears of possible lower production in the next boro rice season because of flood risks. \"A record high amount of rice imports did not contribute significantly to retail rice price reductions in the local market,\" the agency said. The report, citing Bangladesh Bank estimates, said rice imports from India cost Tk 37.89 ($0.46) each kilogram -- 19 percent less than the average retail prices of Tk 45 a kg in Dhaka. The rice production estimate has been reduced slightly on account of lower aman production due to three-day-long unseasonal heavy rain in the harvesting month of December. \"Some farmers reported that they had yield-loss due to 75 percent lodging during the grain maturing stage caused by heavy rains combined with high speed winds,\" the USDA said. Aman production estimate has been reduced to 1.25 crore tonnes. Last fiscal year, aman production was 1.36 crore tonnes, according to data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. As a result, Bangladesh's rice production may decline to 3.26 crore tonnes in the current year from the USDA's November prediction of 3.30 crore tonnes. BBS is yet to release its estimates on aus and aman production this year. The Department of Agricultural Extension of Bangladesh has targeted rice planting on 47.25 lakh hectares area during the current boro season to ensure production of 1.90 crore tonnes of rice this season."

      "text": "In December 2017, the High Court delivered a landmark verdict by ordering the bus owners, driver and insurer to pay compensation for the fatal road accident in 2011 that had led to the death of your husband filmmaker Tareque Masud, Mishuk Munier and three others. What was your experience in the long struggle for justice? As is the case with so many legal battles in this country, our struggle for justice in the compensation case against the bus driver, bus companies and insurers who were directly and indirectly responsible for the crash was a long and difficult one. We first filed the case in February 2012, knowing full well that it could be years before there was any resolution. But I was convinced that it was an important legal battle because of the precedent it could set given the high-profile nature of the case. In parallel, the criminal trial against the bus driver was also going on at the district court in Manikganj, and it was very stressful to pursue both cases at once. Testifying in court for me was like having to relive the events of August 13, 2011 all over again. But we had an excellent team of lawyers in both the criminal and the civil cases, and I am particularly grateful to our legal team led by Dr Kamal Hossain, Sara Hossain, and Ramzan Ali Sikder who handled the High Court case, and also to Khan Khalid Adnan who supported us in the criminal case. Because there was so little precedent, the case required a tremendous amount of research and preparation, but now that the groundwork has been laid, hopefully it will prove useful to others in future. When the verdict was handed down in December 2017, we were tremendously relieved that it had gone in our favour. However, we were disappointed that the insurance company was let off with so little liability. We have appealed the case on this ground, and the opposite side has also appealed the High Court judgment, so we are still awaiting the final decision on the case to be handed down from the Appellate Division. The unique student movement we saw this year propelled the issue of road safety into the limelight. Do you think there are any visible effects of these student protests on our roads today? In terms of the situation on the roads, things have changed very little because there remain fundamental structural issues in the transport sector that have not been resolved. However, I think the change has occurred in the minds of the people, particularly young people who provided a brave example to the country of what might be possible. The memory of what these young people achieved in those few short days cannot be erased, and the issues that they brought to public attention have also not gone away. The much-anticipated Road Transport Act 2018 was passed in Parliament in September. Critics have observed that in the new Act, the right to sue for compensation (which was included in the Motor Vehicles Ordinance) has been replaced by the right to apply for compensation from a Financial Aid Fund. What are your thoughts on this? While the government is to be commended for this attempt to revise some of the outdated aspects of the earlier road transport legislation, with respect to the issue of compensation, the 2018 Act actually represents a step backward. The Motor Vehicle Ordinance 1983, under which we filed our High Court case, contained a provision for suing for compensation from not only drivers but also the transport company owners and insurers. This provision for compensation on the basis of vicarious liability is a standard one in many countries around the world, and is a fundamental necessity for ensuring accountability of those at the apex of the transport sector who are ultimately responsible for the negligence and misconduct of the vehicles they own or insure and the employees that drive them. Only when transport owners and insurers are made financially liable will lasting positive change come to this sector, as they will be motivated out of self-interest to make sure that vehicles meet safety standards, drivers are properly trained, licensed and paid, and traffic rules are enforced and obeyed. But the 2018 Act removes the right of the victims of road crashes to sue for compensation from transport owners and insurers. Possibly it is the powerful lobby groups for these interests who ensured that this provision was dropped from the new Act, out of fear that the precedent set by our case would lead to a flood of similar cases. In place of this provision, which should be a fundamental right, the new Act provides for a mechanism of monetary assistance through a vaguely defined \"Financial Aid Fund\", whose name implies charitable support to victims rather than true compensation for their losses and suffering. Although such a Fund may play an important role in providing more immediate, interim relief to victims of road crashes and their families, it can by no means replace a mechanism of legal compensation, but rather can play an important supplementary role. So with the Road Transport Act of 2018, the owners and insurers have been let off the hook, and they can proceed to operate with impunity as many thousands of lives continue to be lost every year."

      "text": "Rejected tyres of motorcycles and bicycles have traditionally been used to play the game, locally called \"Tyre game\". Nasrin Akhter, who works for development of the people in Char Dawabari, told this correspondent that around 90 percent of the children aged below 12 play 'tyre game,' those above 12 years play ha-du-du and gollachhut while a few children play football, but cricket and other expensive games are not seen in the char. \"It isn't possible for the char children to buy cricket bat and ball, football and other sports accessories due to financial constraint, so they play games that don't need expensive equipment,\" said Nasrin, who works for a non-governmental organisation. Hamidul Islam, 48, of Char Sholmari in Kaliganj upazila, said he bought two rejected motorcycle tyres for Tk 120 from the mainland for his two sons who have been playing in their leisure time for the last one year. \"Our children like to play tyre game,\" he said, adding that char people cannot afford to buy sports equipment for their children. Hamidul's son Sabuj Ali, 6, said he plays tyre game with his elder brother Mobarak Ali, 8, and neighbouring children every day. \"I play tyre game before and after school,\" said Mobarak, a student of Class II at a local school. Aktarul Islam, 45, of Char Khatamari in Sadar upazila, said he also played tyre game in his childhood with bicycle tyre but now the children use motorcycle tyres. \"Tyre game is traditional in our char and our children get great pleasure playing it,\" he added. Nur Islam, 13, said they play ha-du-du and run races during their leisure and sometimes they also play football. \"We don't get football and other sports equipment easily in the char, so we play the games that don't need expensive equipment,\" he said, adding that he reads in Class VII in a mainland school. Schoolteacher Majidul Islam, 55, at border village Jawrani in Hatibandha upazila, said children in the border and remote villages played tyre game a few years ago, but now this has changed and they play modern games, especially cricket. \"The tyre game is still played by the char children, along with other traditional games like ha-du-du, gollachhut and chenku panti,\" Majidul said."

The loop his life goes through is simple: earn, feed, and hope the traffic sergeant won't check his papers when I suddenly halt in the middle of the street and refuse to start. However, I'm not angry that he won't fix me. The fact that he's educating his fifteen year-old daughter instead of marrying her off is the reason I start functioning again despite my wheezing engine.   0800 HOURS We are on the street now, and the weather is convenient for me to function at my best. A woman with a kid ushers for Master to stop, and I impatiently wait as they bargain over the fare, finally settling on something 50 Taka less. Since the road is clear, it takes me less than twenty minutes to reach the school. The woman indifferently pays the fare, which still seemed a little too much for me considering how quickly we reached our destination. But who am I to argue with my Master? He seems pleased that the day has started well, and it gives him a false sense of assurance that the rest of the day is going to be good as well. We take two more uneventful trips with slightly high fares. At least he will have some extra money to fix my engine.   1000 HOURS A young woman bargains with Master regarding the trip fare to her destination. She does not bargain much, however, as she seems eager to escape the impenitent onlookers who are taking in her outfit and probably thinking, \"How dare a woman wear that on the streets?\" As soon as she gets in, relief seems to flood into her. She makes a few phone calls to probably her parents and her colleagues, assuring that she has got a CNG and was on the way. After we drop her off, I really start hoping the other CNG she will hire to go home won't take her somewhere she's not supposed to go.   1200 HOURS I go through the usual drudgery the whole time, except for the short moment when Master kills off my engine and goes off to pee in an open sewer. One of my questions regarding Dhaka is why there aren't enough public bathrooms and awareness about peeing in the open. Don't they know it harms the environment? But then again, I look at my exhaust pipe contributing an unholy amount of carbon into the atmosphere and wheeze.   1500 HOURS The traffic congestion gets worse, and so does the heat. My engine suddenly stops cooperating in the middle of the bustling road. No matter how hard Master tries, I can't start anymore. The passengers throw in a few harsh words, handing Master a quarter of the initial fare and storms off. Master tries a few more times. When he finally realises that I won't be working anymore unless he fixes the faulty gear, I take one last breath before muttering, \"I don't feel so good.\"   Zarin Rayhana likes to spend her time by pondering over alternative theories about the universe instead of studying for school.

      "text": "On August 19, 2017 Bangladeshi NGOs for WHS and COAST(Coastal Association for Social Transformation Trust) Bangladesh in cooperation with Oxfam International organised a public dialogue on \"Strengthening Civil Society and Promoting Localisation Agenda: Development Effectiveness (DE), WHS and Grand Bargain (GB)  Policy Outcomes and its Implementation in Bangladesh\" in observation of the World Humanitarian Day 2017 at Lakeshore Hotel, Dhaka. Oxfam in Bangladesh and Start Fund Bangladesh supported in organising the seminar with the solidarity of ADRRN (Asian Disaster Risk Reduction Network) and NEAR (Network for Empowering Aid Response). Here we publish a summary of the discussions. Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, Executive Director of COAST Trust and Coordinator of Bangladesh NGOs for World Humanitarian Summit (BNW)  and moderator of the session: The organisers' group in the last four months has translated and prepared brief papers on DE, WHS and GB policy outcomes and discussed the implications in Bangladesh, especially with respect to partnership relations with Bangladeshi NGOs (non-government organisations) or civil society with INGOs (international NGOs), donors and UN (United Nations) agencies. The group has developed the Charter of Expectations (CE) both in English and Bangla through a participatory way within BNW which has been sent out to all the dialogue participants in the last seven days. I request the participants to focus on the expectations agenda during their deliberations. Bangladesh is known for its vibrant civil society with respect to development, so along with the state and market as a third sector, sovereign, accountable and sustainable growth is needed, where the DE, WHS and GB outcomes' major thrust on \"localisation\" gave new dynamics. This is the first event prior to go for a country wide campaign and we are planning a convention at later part of the year with the feedback and its culmination. Rasheda K Choudhury, Advisor to the Former Care Taker Government, Executive Director, CAMPE and Chair of the dialogue: I am pleased to take part in this programme graced by all the major development partners and stakeholders including government representatives and NGOs. One cannot imagine the sufferings young girls and women come across in flood-affected areas. To pave the path for visible change, we feel the urgency of strengthening the civil society in Bangladesh as well as the whole world. We also feel the need for promoting a localisation agenda. But a big question mark hangs over how the global agenda can be translated into the local context. Three Cs are crucial: context, capacity and commitment. What's the context, or to be precise, the local context? Where is the capacity to deliver from the government's end, civil society's end or that of other stakeholders?  Shawkat Ali Tutul, Assistant Director- Social Accountability and Disaster Risk Reduction , COAST as keynote speaker: Since 2008, humanitarian partners have been observing the day to pay tribute to those who risked their lives for humanitarian assistance. On the occasion of the day this year, we have poised ourselves to strengthen the civil society and promote a localisation agenda. As part of promoting this agenda, we recommend that the local NGOs operating in a particular area are prioritised when projects related to that specific locality are being handed out. Our commitment and strategies align on mainly three international policies: development effectiveness, world humanitarian summit and grand bargain policy. Development effectiveness is basically a partnership among the government, civil society, donors and other stakeholders for effective development, especially in the third world countries. We have proposed a host of demands in the form of the Charter of Expectations from INGOs, donors and UN agencies for equitable and dignified partnership. Shova Rani Mandol, Executive Director, SASUS: I can tell you the story of a woman, raised in a remote area, desperately trying to provide humanitarian assistances to those in need but ending up being a victim of gender discrimination, communal discrimination, and above all, facing false allegations. People like us who run local NGOs are the ones who need the funding and assistance most. You know we don't receive bank loans without mortgage. If we don't receive funding, we will be uprooted like a plant in times of flood. Rafiqul Islam, Executive Director, Dwip Unnayan Procesta (DUS): Following liberation, Bangladesh was greatly in need of relief. But now, in Bangladesh's transition from relief to development--we are in a state where we do not need much relief--lies contribution from local NGOs. People like Shova Rani made a difference. They worked voluntarily and ran their organisations. The time has come for development partners to collaborate with local NGOs. You know climate change is leading to innumerable issues like abrupt rainfall, inundation and food crisis. If today a calamity hits the coastal area and washes away tens of thousands of people or riverbank erosion renders them homeless, should we expect international organisations to come forward and salvage us? Therefore, the solution has to come from within. AHM Bazlur Rahaman, Chief Executive Officer, Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication (BNNRC): I fully agree with the policy outcomes and Bangladeshi NGOs' expectations in view of the policy outcomes of WHS, GB and DE. I have observed the urgency of bridging the gap between INGOs and local NGOs, which would be tantamount to achieving part of the sustainable development goals. I believe that we should immediately make an action plan on these and implement them without further delay. We should also arrange yearly review programmes on how much we have progressed in terms of this. AM Nasir Uddin, Manager -Disaster Risk Reduction, Action Aid Bangladesh: It is a sad fact that the hurdles women change-makers used to face 40 years back are the same as the ones they are facing even today. They are still encountering the same issues like social stigma while working on their own ideas or coming up with an NGO. Though our Constitution dictates equality at all levels, we are yet to get there. We have envisioned transforming ourselves into a middle-income nation by 2021 and a developed nation by 2041. If we don't communicate the message to the local actors, it will be hard for us to make any significant change. Foyezullah Chowdhury, Executive Director, Borendra Prochesta: The capacity, vision and transparency of NGOs are not always beyond question. Sometimes the donor organisations are doubtful about whether or not the NGO they are going to fund will be able to serve the cause rightfully. That doesn't necessarily mean that all NGOs are incapable or lack transparency; it is also a question about who or in what context the capacity is defined. There should be a clearly defined method to find out which local NGOs lack in which way. Their lacking has to be overcome and their strength intensified. Asaduzzaman Shiekh, Executive Director, Udayan Bangladesh: In the aftermath of cyclone Sidr, the super-cyclone that killed 11 of my relatives, we, local NGOs, started reaching out to people on our own. We approached donor agencies. They were a little doubtful about our capacity since we lacked any formal identity like that of a registered organisation. However, donor agencies later involved us in their project. They may get their job done and leave the region but we will never cease to work in the coastal areas. Sumon Islam, Academy Centre Director, Humanitarian Leadership Academy: If we estimate that the top five percent of people have USD 10,000 income per capita, and many of them are willing to help people, or if we observe that a British man is eager to help our people through a trusted international organisation, I must ask whether or not our people entrust local NGOs with the same task. The challenge is how the money pumped in by local benevolent people can be mobilised through local NGOs. I also recommend that a proper certification system be introduced based on the transparency, strength and experiences a particular local NGO possesses. Momtaz Khatun, Executive Director, Ashroy Foundation: INGOs often have a tendency to directly reach out to people instead of partnering with local NGOs. I recommend INGOs take part in capacity-building of local NGOs. I also recommend that local women's organisations be prioritised when it comes to offering any project. Sonjit Leo Gomez, Senior Coordinator-Programmes, Stromme Foundation: As a representative of an INGO, I observed that the local NGOs we partner with understand the cause we work for; but they fail to communicate the message to their employees. This ultimately leads to a sort of communication gap. Another burning issue is transparency, which INGOs give the highest importance to.  Sajid Raihan, Country Manager, Start Fund Bangladesh: When we talk about localisation agenda, its definition should be well-clarified. If local NGOs are endowed with the lion's share of total funding, it will not guarantee their empowerment or automatically translate into the empowerment of the communities. If local NGOs always look for funding from INGOs, the scenario will not change to a great extent. Rather, we recommend that the local NGOs ensure the maximum use of local resources, which would strengthen their capability. Moreover, proper coordination among the government, local NGOs and INGOs should be maintained to bring in visible change. Shaheen Anam, Executive Director,  Manusher Jonno Foundation: People talk about corruption of NGOs, and I would like to ask how one can expect NGOs to be an angel when corruption is endemic in every sphere of society; after all NGOs are also part of this society. Just like not all government officials are corrupt in the same manner, not all NGOs are corrupt; in fact I would say most are not. The positive changes brought about by NGOs in Bangladesh have earned us worldwide recognition and should be appreciated. The job of an NGO is not just providing people with better healthcare, education or other services but to build their capacity and enable them to raise their voice to demand those services as their right and entitlement. Murshed Alam, Executive Director, POPI: In Bangladesh, we have already observed that a handful of organisations began their journey in a little village but ended up going national or even global. This is a great example to be emulated by others. In reality, local NGOs can run with their own resources but INGOs cannot survive without international funding. So, in terms of capacity, local NGOs can outshine INGOs when it comes to mobilising local resources. Local organisations can implement humanitarian initiatives at the minimal administrative cost. Edouard Weigbour, Country Representative, UNICEF: Definitely, localisation is the best way to extend humanitarian assistance. To pave the path forward for this, different types of links between the NGOs and the government must be built for providing better services. Orla Murphy, Country Director, Plan International: We know Bangladesh is transforming. And the role of humanitarian actors is as well. We all feel the urgency of empowering the voice of local communities, the voice of local actors and understanding the impact at the local level. At the same time, there are other voices in a partnership. So we have to hold each other accountable to catalyse the process of building capacity and strength. Each of the actors such as the community, local government, the national government and the donor agencies has to complement the role of the other. Mark Pierce, Country Director, Save the Children International: I must mention that a child in a disaster-hit area doesn't need any explanation as to where the assistance is coming from. All that matters is the assistance reached out to the child timely and adequately. We all agree to the point that local NGOs have an instrumental role to play when it comes to carrying out humanitarian actions. One thing should be noted: Disasters are particularly more devastating when there is lack of planning or preparedness. So local NGOs have to be strengthened in line with those issues. Khandakar Rakibur Rahman, Director General of NGO Affairs Bureau, Prime Minister's Office: The government is enthusiastic about promoting small-scale local NGOs by providing them with support including funding. Both local NGOs and NGO Affairs Bureau have to build up their capacity and maintain a close link for providing better services to the countrymen. Reiza Dejito, Country Director,  Handicap International:  On the occasion of the World Humanitarian Day, we are talking about inclusion and unity and are mulling over a common platform where we all will stand upon to carry out humanitarian actions together. We have to go back to our roots and deliver on our commitments by resolving all the issues through mutual understanding. Nipin Gangadharan, Country Director, Action Against Hunger: I don't think there is any tension between INGOs and NGOs. At different times of disasters, we have worked hand in hand for extending humanitarian assistance. In the last two decades, the instrumental role of partnership has become very clear. Gowhar Nayeem Wahra, Member Secretary of  Disaster Forum and Adjunct Faculty Dhaka University:  Employees of small organisations are not adequately paid. Another thing is that these organisations lack access to funding. This is a burning issue we have been dealing with over the last three decades but haven't been able to resolve yet. Local NGOs are being washed away like objects in the face of floodwater. I don't necessarily agree to the point that local NGOs lack capacity. In Istanbul, we talked about GB. But, we haven't figured out how it can be translated into the local context. We must face the question as to whether we are partnering with local organisations on the grounds of low payment or working with them for strengthening their capacity. It's a basic moral question. I believe that a close relationship \"based on dignity\" has to be maintained between local NGOs, INGOs and donor agencies for serving the people better. MB Akhter, Program Director, Oxfam International: We need a locally accepted and designed pathway for the localisation campaign. What are the asks of this Charter for Change and how does it fit with Bangladesh? We need to find out at least five short- and long-term asks that actually create an environment which facilitates the localisation. I am sure if local CSOs find the asks interesting, they will join and support the localisation process. AKM Jashim Uddin, Director, Association of Development Agencies Bangladesh (ADAB): There are several studies that concluded that if INGOs and donors invest money in local NGOs and do the project with them, then results turn out to be sustained and transaction costs become less.  Md. Arifur Rahman, Chief Executive,  Young Power in Social Action (YPSA): INGOs and donors most of the time create new networks as a part of their project achievements, but later on the networks hardly sustain. So, we urge the INGOs and donors to try first with the existing networks, make the efforts transparent, inclusive and participatory, rather than creating unnecessary tensions within the wider NGO sector. Anwar Zahid, Executive Director, Integrated Community Development Association (ICDA): Sometimes donors and INGOs do projects of the same nature both directly and through partnership, but in both respect they maintain different levels of salary and benefits-especially when it's direct, they give high salary and input to show better results, thus creating bad results, but blame outcomes on the poor local NGO partners. It is unfair. Rafiqul Islam, Executive Director, Rupantor: Using the local language should be the prime concern with respect to localisation. All the INGOs and donors have highly professional local staff who can easily introduce local language for inviting submission of project proposals and communication with local partners. It is not fair to introduce English, even at the field level, only for one or two foreigners."

      "text": "In 2002, Bangladesh became the first country in the world to ban thinner plastic bags. The unprecedented step generated a lot of positive buzz. The ban is still on. But so is the use of polythene shopping bags. Such bags, known as polybags, continue to flood kitchen markets across the country. A complementary polybag is given to shoppers for whatever they buy. It is evident then that more than a decade after the ban, not one government agency has been able to control the production, distribution, usage and dumping of these polybags. Worryingly, because there is no control, nobody has any authentic data on how many polybags are produced and used in the country. The environment department says they do not have enough capacity to ensure the implementation of the ban. \"We only conduct raids in the shops and storage units [of polythene bags]. But it is hard to reach their factories and [conduct] raid because those are located in narrow lanes in the old towns and our people get assaulted when we go there to raid those factories,\" said Masud Iqbal Md Shameem, director, Dhaka division, Department of Environment (DoE). \"There is an exemption on [the use of] polythene bags for packaging industries. Some dishonest businessmen take this opportunity and produce polybags...,\" he said. Compounding the problem has been the government's inability to provide a widely-used alternative. Thus, demand for polythene bags never reduced, he said. Visiting kitchen markets, including in Mohammadpur, Indira Road and Karwan Bazar, it was found that synthetic bags made of discarded cement bags and net bags made of nylons threads were available in the markets. However, the customers would have to buy those whereas traders were giving the polythene bags for free. Zahir Mia, a vegetable trader from Mohammadpur, said they could buy polythene shopping bags from the town hall market itself. \"And the supply of those bags never fall short,\" said Zahir Mia. \"We provide these shopping bags to the customers because they also want it.\" When asked how many polybags are produced in Bangladesh, Shameem said, the department had no data about it. The DoE had no data as the factories were not legal, he said. As per their data, a total of eight taskforces of the department conducted 152 raids and seized 125,05,808 kgs of polybags since 2015. They also charged Tk 147, 22,100 as fine and accused 1,308 in this connection. However, sources in the department said, Bangladesh imported plastic raw materials worth Tk 2,000 crore and the country generated nearly 1,700 tons of plastic waste everyday of which only half was being recycled. Although the history of plastic is more than a 100 years old, in Bangladesh, plastic products, especially polythene shopping bags, were introduced widely in the early eighties. Within five years, they became a serious threat to the environment, said environment experts. Then, Bangladesh became the first country in the world to ban such bags. But due to lack of regulation, local markets continue to be flooded with them. According to Rule 6ka of Clause-5 under Section-9 of Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act (2010), restriction has been imposed in the production and uses of polythene shopping bags. According to the rule, the production and sale of environmentally harmful products is restricted. Though plastic bags are widely available, no plastic trader or entrepreneur admits their role in the business. \"I used to produce polybags till 2001. But I left that business when the government banned it. Now I only import plastic beads. I do not know who produces them,\" said a former president of Bangladesh Plastic Babsayee Samity under the condition of anonymity. Experts feel that Bangladesh took a great initiative but could not continue it."

The day is not far off when we will have no water in the rivers. All the bilateral and international efforts to solve the problem are bearing no fruit. So what should we do? Can we survive without water in the rivers? The answer is an unqualified \"no\". With no water in the rivers, Bangladesh will eventually turn into a desert and we as a race will go extinct. Do we have to wait helplessly for the fait accompli? We do not have to depend on the water that will trickle down the rivers after other countries have sucked out every drop from them. Bangladesh is a blessed country which gets plenty of rain. With the exception of the relatively dry western region of Rajshahi, where the annual rainfall is about 1,600mm, most parts of the country receive at least 2,000mm of rainfall per year. But what happens to all that water? Most of it drains out to the Bay of Bengal. Can we not do anything to prevent the enormous waste of water? Bangladesh is full of ponds, dighies, beels and haors which store considerable amount of water. But that is not enough for our needs. Moreover, many of them are not accessible to the farmers. But there are many dried out rivers and canals all over the country. Some of them get flooded by the water flowing from the big rivers and some do not even get that but get filled up by rainwater. There are no efforts to save this water which flows into the sea leaving us with virtually no water for the dry seasons. Can we do anything to save this precious water? Harvesting this rainwater is the only way to meet all our needs.  We have to create storage structures throughout the country. Perhaps the experts are already thinking about it. I suggest we build multiple dams along all the dried out rivers and canals in the country to harvest rainwater and create artificial lakes. It may be necessary to dredge them to ensure depth in order to make them capable of holding water which is sufficient for the dry seasons. The heights of these dams should be calculated to ensure that there is none higher than normal flood in the adjoining lands during the rainy seasons. They should be constructed according to the gradient of the rivers or canals. There should also be provisions to get rid of extra water. Similarly, we have to create planned water bodies out of the existing ponds, dighies, beels and haors. We may even have to dig ponds within agricultural lands that have no access to water. To make it sustainable the people of the country have to be involved in rain harvesting. We need to create mass awareness on the benefits of rain harvesting. People have to be trained on how to use the water from these artificial water bodies without harming the environment. They will also have to know how to maintain them. It goes without saying that these water bodies can be used for fishing also. Moreover, they will create a good environment for different kinds of flora and fauna. These water bodies will even attract migratory birds during the winter seasons. Finally, let us not depend on the mercy of other countries for our water needs. The skies give us more than sufficient water for drinking, cooking, bathing, washing, farming and running industries. Nature's bounty is there all around us. Do we have eyes to see and will to use them for our survival? Brigadier General QM Shahjahan Hafiz is a former director of Medical Service of Bangladesh Army and a WHO consultant."

This facility is a most commendable effort, which is built with material that is widely available and environment-friendly. Our local government authorities should build this design in several char areas on a test basis to see if it lives up to the promise of being the floating dream house with income-generating potentials. And if the design is a success, we should go for nationwide building which will benefit our climate-vulnerable communities. The government should also provide monetary help, particularly to people living in the more vulnerable areas, to build the new type of weather resilient houses."

      "text": "Elite divers hauled four more young footballers out of a flooded Thai cave yesterday, authorities said, bringing to eight the number saved in a stunning rescue mission but still leaving five others trapped. \"Hooyah,\" the Thai Navy SEALs, who have played a crucial role in the against-the-odds operation, said in a Facebook post as they announced that a total of eight members of the \"Wild Boars\" football team had been rescued on Sunday and yesterday. Thais have been fixated on the crisis, hoping desperately for the safe return of the 12 boys and their 25-year-old football coach, after they ventured into the Tham Luang cave complex after practice and became trapped by rising waters more than a fortnight ago. The extraction of the four yesterday followed a similar pattern to the previous day, with the youngsters emerging in quick succession just before nightfall after navigating a treacherous escape route of more than four kilometres (2.5 miles) that included extremely narrow and flooded tunnels. Although the rescued eight were all presumed to be the boys, aged between 11 and 16, authorities did not reveal their identities nor confirm whether the coach remained inside the cave. Asked if the remaining five would be shuttled out together, rescue operations chief Narongsak Osottanakorn said it was up to the divers whose meticulous plans, including stashing extra oxygen tanks along the route, are \"set for four people, if we bring five we have to change the plan\". The rescue mission was stood down at nightfall to allow officials to replenish oxygen supplies, and has again stood down last night to begin again today. In a late-night press conference Narongsak Osottanakorn also delivered a message from Thai premier Prayut Chan-O-Cha, a gruff former general: \"The Prime Minister wants this to be a lesson, this should not happen again in Thailand,\" Narongsak said. The saga has dominated global headlines, with the team spending nine days unaccounted for inside the cave, before British divers found them -- emaciated and dishevelled -- huddling on a muddy bank above the flooding. Authorities then struggled to determine the best way to save the \"Wild Boars\", with the group stuck on a shelf above the floodwaters in pitch darkness. Among the ideas were drilling an escape route through the mountain, or leaving them for months until the monsoon season ended and the flooding subsided. But with oxygen levels inside dropping to dangerous lows and the prospect of heavy rains flooding the area completely, authorities decided they had to move quickly and take the group out through the water-filled tunnels. Narongsak described Sunday's initial rescue bid as \"D-Day\" when it was launched, and there were fears that any one of many potential pitfalls could prove deadly. Among these were that none of the boys had scuba diving experience, and that they could easily panic while swimming underwater across twisted passageways in darkness. Dozens of foreign divers and other experts from around the world were brought in to help the rescue effort, working alongside the Thai Navy SEALs. But the death of a former Thai Navy SEAL diver who ran out of oxygen in the cave on Friday underscored the danger of the journey. The first successes on Sunday offered hope of a fairytale ending to the ordeal. Rescue chief Narongsak on Sunday described their journey out, escorted by the elite divers, as \"smooth\". Crucially, round-the-clock pumping to ease some of the flooding paid off and threatened heavy rains did not arrive. That led an upbeat Narongsak to promise more \"good news\" yesterday afternoon that materialised a few hours later with the emergence of the other four. But although the eight were rescued, there were concerns they may have contracted an illness while in the cave. Narongsak said after the first four boys were rescued that they would be quarantined \"for a while because we are concerned about infections\". And rain could still re-emerge as a threat for the remaining five, particularly if there are complications that could delay the extraction further. Authorities have repeatedly said the rain could re-flood crucial parts of the cave complex that have been drained and make the escape route much harder or even impossible to navigate. Weather forecasters warned heavy rain could hit the area through the week. Premier Prayut visited the rescue base yesterday night to deliver his congratulations to all those involved, but also to offer a note of caution. \"Everyone should be proud. (But) the mission is not over yet,\" Prayut said."

      "text": "At the very core of our entire ecosystem is the location and availability of fresh water on which sustaining lives and human livelihood are fundamentally dependent. One school of thought envisages future wars being fought over steadily depleting water resources, required by humans, other species and vegetation that sustain both. To prevent this situation from deteriorating further to the point that it could become an existential threat for man's survival in whatever geo-space he inhabits, we need to engage in collaborative management of the shared ecological space and resources, particularly fresh water resources that are critically taxed and in a state of alarming depletion today. A steady growth of population in South Asia has made this region one of the most densely populated globally, with very large numbers subsisting on marginal land. This region, comprising Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, has, as of 2015, a combined aggregate total of over 1.743 billion, registering a staggering 336 percent increase over a mere 476 million in 1950. It will almost double its present numbers by 2050. Its burgeoning demographic \"youth bulge\" is a factor of critical importance. South Asia's average percentage of population between ages 15-59 in 2015 was 60.75; in 2050, this average is projected to be 60.88 (ECOSOC 2015). The trend of population growth, unless reversed or brought to a halt, will surely add pressure on already tight food and water supplies. For a deltaic region like Bangladesh, which is the natural drainage for most of the Eastern Himalayan rivers, a double-whammy effect is already in progress. The sheer increase in population and the cumulative effects of glacier melts in the Himalayas (Himalayan glaciers have reportedly shrunk from 500,000 square kms coverage to 160,000 square kilometres) and depleted ground water aquifers are already significantly adversely impacting the availability of fresh water supplies. Bangladesh finds itself in an extremely vulnerable situation in respect to water security, despite being a land of countless rivers comprising three major river basins, of which 54 rivers are shared with India, its immediate upper riparian. An incompletely executed bilateral treaty exists on only one of the shared rivers (The Ganges), while an agreed draft on another remains frozen in a state of suspended animation. Taking a river-by-river approach would leave Bangladesh very vulnerable to the vagaries of nature and the unpredictability of geopolitics. The narrative of sharing, furthermore, is evocative of the partitioning of waters which leads into the realm of contestation. In fact, most of the problems contributing to this situation of increasing water distress may be squarely attributed to The Partition Syndrome of 1947. While segmenting land and territories on terra firma is entirely feasible and achievable, what was forgotten in the heat of inflamed passions at that time was that the principles of partitioning land cannot be applied to the hydrosphere, atmosphere and ecosphere. In my view, this fallacious thinking was reflected in the formulation of the Constitution of the new Indian Union of 1947, in which sovereignty of the rivers was accorded to the respective states of the Union through which those rivers traversed. This is at the heart of the myriad problems of water sharing that India has struggled with over almost all of its rivers, whether within its domestic sphere or with the post-Partition transnational configuration of those rivers. The conditions described above pose several challenges today for the entire region. Governments must now cater to overall ecological and environmental security, food security, water security, energy security, employment security, and health security. Additionally, governments also must prepare for unexpected disasters from natural phenomena or threats of disease pandemics breaking out. Ensuring water security and integrity is perhaps the most important of all, water being vital for agriculture, industrial use, fisheries, human consumption, health and sanitation, but addressing this will pose formidable challenges. Towards this end, all governments now have no alternative but to collectively address and treat rivers--and indeed all sources of fresh waters--as Commons. To move towards putting in place a viable governance structure for collectively and jointly managing their common waters, South Asians must put in place a governance structure to reasonably manage their shared water commons. In 2010, participating in a dialogue contemplating what South Asia's response would be to the non-traditional scenario likely to buffet the region in 2025 (extrapolating from then existing and known facts and situation on the ground), I had advocated the formation of a comprehensive, multi-bodied architecture of cooperative mechanism that South Asians, I had hoped, would have the common sense to move towards, chastened by an angered Mother Nature and an enraged environment. I repeat that call today, with a greater sense of urgency than ever before, for collective consideration by all South Asians, to come together to put in place a South Asian Water Security Authority (SAWSA). SAWSA's water security mandate should exercise overall jurisdiction over all types of water bodies, viz. ground water aquifers, surface water, rainwater and even sea water. It should be tasked with monitoring and managing all water resources in the region in a holistic manner to regulate conservation of these resources as well as to prevent abuse or wastage. For managing surface water resources, SAWSA should establish an empowered subsidiary body, namely the Eastern Himalayan River Basins Management Body (EHRBMB), to deal with the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Meghna and related basins. This body will undertake to train the entire course of each river, including its tributaries and distributaries, through building embankments, dredging, creating small-to-medium sized pondage areas to serve not only as reservoirs but also for hydroelectricity generating projects. Where deemed necessary, flood drainage canals will also be excavated to distribute/disperse unexpected seasonal surges of flood waters evenly, with populations in vulnerable areas being properly educated and trained to deal with such events. Service roads should be constructed along one or both banks along the entire course of a river to the extent possible. Also, each bank should be lined with a belt of several rows of indigenous trees that serve to enhance carbon sequestration areas. Maintenance of these will be done throughout the year on a continuing basis, involving the local population along the course of the river, who will act as guardians of the rivers. This will create a constant bank of employment for the local people, integrate with rural employment schemes that are gender-blind, be more labour-intensive rather than capital-intensive; it will also generate local wealth besides creating a sense of local ownership of the commons as well as ensuring continuous maintenance. As guardians of these rivers, the local communities will comprise an early warning system alerting concerned authorities to the impending risk or dangers to the river and its environ. South Asians need to come together, for the sake of self-preservation at least, if nothing else, to pacify Nature, arrest and start rolling back the grievous damage that they have thoughtlessly inflicted on the common ecosphere, and to collectively manage, conserve, and restore the health of their shared river basins for optimum use of their steadily diminishing water resources. We must do it now, not later. Procrastinating on collectively and collaboratively addressing an existential challenge can never be an option for this region ready to burst at its seams.

In fiscal 2017-18, letters of credit settlement stood at $51.53 billion, up 16.40 percent year-on-year, on the back of rising demand for food grains and petroleum products. Rice imports ballooned more than 23 times to $1.71 billion thanks to abnormal flooding last year that destroyed crops. Import of petroleum products stood at $3.34 billion last fiscal year, up 32.70 percent year-on-year, according to data from the Bangladesh Bank. The requirement for petroleum products has increased significantly in recent times as a number of fuel-based power plants are being set up to meet the growing demand for electricity, said Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Dhaka Bank. The recent price surge in global oil market also played a role in increasing the payment for the item last fiscal year. The bulky import bill caused a large trade gap and current account deficit last fiscal year, and in the process, depreciation of the exchange rate against the dollar, said Rahman, also the chairman of the Association of Bankers, Bangladesh, a platform of the chief executives of private banks. On June 30, the inter-bank exchange rate stood at Tk 83.75 per dollar, up from Tk 80.60, according to data from the BB. M Kamal Hossain, managing director of Southeast Bank, forecasted further widening of the current account deficit as a large amount of private sector foreign loans would mature next year. Some unscrupulous persons might be laundering money in the name of imports by over-invoicing, which might have pushed up the import bill, said AB Mirza Azizul Islam, a former caretaker government adviser. Typically, over- or under-invoicing is done for import of industrial raw materials and capital machinery. Last fiscal year, import of industrial raw materials increased 12.36 percent year-on-year to $18.22 billion and that of capital machinery 4.48 percent to $4.66 billion. The opening of overall LCs stood at $69.42 billion last fiscal year, up 44.25 percent from a year earlier. \"The huge import growth will also stoke inflation,\" Islam added."

      "text": "For Bangladesh 2017 has been a mixed year of achievements and challenges. Though some macro indicators reflect the positive trends, the overall strength of the economy is weakening due to a number of developments toward the second half of the year. One of the major achievements of the economy has been a 7.28 percent economic growth in FY 2016-17 breaking the six percent cycle that continued for a decade or so. Like previous years, major boost of growth has come from the industrial sector followed by the services sector. Though average inflation has been around 5.5 percent, food inflation is showing an increasing rate in recent months, mainly because of agricultural loss due to two rounds of flood. Investment is a major impetus to Bangladesh's growth. Target was set to increase investment to 32.7 percent of GDP in FY 2016-17, keeping in mind the need for a growing economy. In FY 2016-17, investment as a share of GDP went up to 30.5 percent, a marginal increase from 29 percent in FY 2015-16. However, the private sector's investment has been almost stagnant since FY 2015-16 hovering around 23 percent. The major boost has come from the public sector that saw an increase to 7.4 percent in FY 2016-17 from 6.7 percent in FY 2015-16. Domestic savings-GDP ratio increased by only 0.3 percent in FY 2016-17 while national savings-GDP ratio declined by 1.2 percentage point to 20.6 percent in FY 2016-17 from 30.8 percent in FY 2015-16 in the backdrop of the large current account deficit. This has narrowed the gap between national savings and total investment as a share of GDP for the first time in recent years, which otherwise displayed a gap implying that resources are not fully utilised. The external sector has been a source of strength for the Bangladesh economy for several years. This has changed in recent periods. Export growth in FY 2016-17 was only 1.7 percent as opposed to the target of 8 percent. A glimmer of hope is in the horizon with both RMG and total exports picking up during July-December of FY 2017-18. However, imports growing at a higher rate than exports led to a negative current account balance that continued during July-October of FY 2017-18. In FY 2016-17 remittance earning growth experienced a negative growth of (-)15.9 percent despite increase of manpower export. One important reason for low remittances despite high growth of manpower exports is the flow of remittances through informal channels. Strong Bangladeshi Taka against the US Dollar also played a role for low export and remittances growth to some extent. Though remittances have started to pick up in recent months it is not significant since it was negative during the last fiscal year. In 2017, the banking sector exposed further weaknesses through major indicators such as rise of non-performing loans, lower capital adequacy and the overall lack of governance in the sector. Though the period of BASEL III implementation is approaching in 2019, most banks are not prepared. The government has been recapitalising the state-owned banks for their loss every year without any fruition. This has been an unfortunate example of using public money towards compensating for the greed of bank defaulters. The proposed law allowing more members of the same family to be directors of the privately-owned banks and extension of their tenure are apprehended to further deteriorate the governance in private banks. Despite the central bank's attempt to improve performance of the banking sector, improvements are not visible yet. The independence of the central has been gradually diminishing due to political influence. If reform measures are not taken, the crisis of the banking sector will have serious implications for the economy. Another setback in FY 2016-17 was that the government backed out from passing the value added tax (VAT) law which was all set to be launched in FY 2017-18. Meeting the target for domestic resource mobilisation has thus become challenging. From a geo-political point, 2017 has been most challenging for Bangladesh as the Rohingyas from the Rakhine state of Myanmar started to flee to Bangladesh from August 25, 2017 onwards following a fresh round of torture and killings by the Myanmar army. Rohingyas moved into Bangladesh in thousands every day, bringing their number in Bangladesh to one million in total if the previous influx of the seventies and the nineties are taken into account. Though they are supported by the international community, some fiscal burden will befall the government of Bangladesh which will have budgetary implications. The year 2018 will be a turning point for Bangladesh in many ways. Bangladesh will prepare to graduate from the least developed country status in 2018. It will also continue its efforts toward becoming a middle-income country. Additionally, it will continue to implement the sustainable development goals (SDGs). These will hinge on a number of factors such as accelerated resource mobilisation, higher investment, efficiency in infrastructure implementation, skilled human resources and strong institutional set up. Lastly, Bangladesh has placed significant emphasis on the growth rate of its gross domestic product while the quality and distributional aspects of GDP growth have been overlooked. Incremental benefit from such growth has accrued to the rich rather than the poor. It is disturbing to note that top 10 percent possess 38 percent of Bangladesh's total income while the bottom 10 percent only has one percent of the total income of the country. High growth is yet to be translated into generation of enough income for the poor, creation of employment, access to quality education and better healthcare for all, and above all, reducing income inequality. In the coming years, policymakers must make broader development goals their objectives instead of being overwhelmed by narrow growth targets.

      "text": "However, the project, scheduled to complete by June 2021, will bring no respite for city residents this monsoon. It is expected to benefit five million residents when completed. Shahid Uddin, a Wasa director, said that the project work would start after the funds are released. Excavating the old canals and protecting them with retaining walls are two main components of the project, Shahid, also a former Wasa chief engineer, said.  The project on drainage extension and canal digging will be placed at the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) meeting today for approval. According to a planning ministry report, 26 out of the capital's 44 canals are under Wasa's supervision. Most parts of the 26 canals have not yet been developed. During heavy rainfall in monsoon, the city suffers from water-logging due to the poor state of canals. About 20 km old canals will be dug and improved under the project. Dhanmondi, Hajaribagh, Shankar, Jigatola, Rayer Bazar, Mohammadpur, Shyamoli, Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, Darus Salam, Mirpur, Pallabi, Cantonment and Uttara areas are under the project. The scheme that officially began last month is expected to end in December 2020. About 52 lakh out of 2 crore Dhaka residents will be benefitted, the planning ministry proposal said. Meanwhile, Khandker Mosharraf Hossain, local government, rural development and cooperatives minister, said that the government would instruct Dhaka Wasa and two city corporations to look after the storm drainage system in the capital. On April 3, the Ecnec with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair approved the draft proposal for another canal excavation project that would cost Tk 607 crore. Over 82 percent of the money would be used for acquiring 30.5 acres of \"private land\" in five canals--Hazaribagh, Baishteki, Sangbadaik Colony, Begunbari and Manda Khal--flowing through the city. Rest of the money would be spent for compensating the people owning structures on the land, excavation and bank development. Excavation of a new canal, named Kurmitola, on 4.5 acres of private land is also under the scheme. The Kurmitola canal will drain rainwater out of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport and the old airport in Tejgaon. The local government ministry proposed the two-year scheme to be implemented by Dhaka Wasa by December next year. Urban planners say the inadequate drainage managed by seven authorities with little coordination and reckless filling-up of wetlands and flood flow areas are the key reasons behind waterlogging in the capital. They repeatedly warned against the continued destruction of the flood plains and wetland for \"mindless commercial gains\". The city's natural drainage system--comprised of a network of 65 canals and four rivers, numerous water retention areas (ponds, ditches), extensive low-lying areas and flood flow zones--has been destroyed in the name of development, they said. Canals, rivers and water retention areas collect, carry and retain rainwater and are connected to each other as a drainage network. The low-lying wetlands and flood flow zones earmarked in the Detailed Area Plan of Dhaka city no longer exist as they have been filled up, in many cases with government approval, resulting in severe urban waterlogging, experts said."

About Bangladesh's success in the agricultural sector, Hasina said Bangladeshi scientists have developed salinity-, flood- and drought-tolerant crops, aiming to boost food production in the country. She informed the Thai princess that Bangladesh has become self-sufficient in freshwater fish and is producing huge amount of meat every year. The prime minister showed interest in boosting cooperation between the two countries on mango cultivation, as Thailand is famous for producing the popular fruit round the year. The Thai princess said her country has given Bangladesh \"Vetiver grass\" which is long and thick in size, to plant these in coastal areas and on river slopes, to prevent erosion. She said Thailand is importing Bangladeshi litchi, which is very popular among Thai people. PM's International Affairs Adviser Dr Gowher Rizvi, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Md Shahriar Alam, Principal Secretary Md Nojibur Rahman, Bangladeshi Ambassador to Thailand Sayeeda Muna Tasneem and Thai Ambassador in Dhaka Panpimon Suwannapongse were present at the meeting."

He was speaking at an informal gathering with the team at the BFF House yesterday, following the team's return in the early hours. \"I want to congratulate you for being champions. It makes me happy that the city [Hong Kong] you came back from as champions is the one I also played and my elder daughter, too, was born in that city,\" the BFF boss told the team in presence of media. However, he asked them not to get carried away with the triumph and the subsequent flood of congratulations as he felt much tougher tests await them. \"It is only the beginning of a long journey. To reach the top is much easier than staying there. There are many players who play very well for a week but if he/she can't continue the next day he/she will fall behind. So it is tough to reach the top but even tougher to stay there. \"You are only 14, 15 and 16 years old, in the next 4 to 5 years, you have to train/practice six times more than now. When the level of your training increases by ten times after 4 to 5 years, then you will be a real footballer,\" Salahuddin said. The head of Bangladesh football gave the example of Sabina Khatun, the national women's team captain who is now playing in the Indian Women's League, to inspire these budding footballers. \"You see Sabina. I want to see you playing the league in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and if you can do that then today's gift would be nothing,\" he said. The team's proud coach Golam Rabbani Choton informed there is hardly any time for these girls to relax. \"These girls will join the ongoing long-term camp today as we have a number of international tournaments ahead including a futsal tournament in Thailand next month,\" he said. He however, feels that the young players have already benefited a lot from the camp. \"They have obviously improved in technical skills as well as mental toughness, but the difference was physical fitness. Our players played in full tempo for the entire matches all throughout the three games. This happened due to the continuous camp that the girls are in,\" Choton added. The tournament's top-scorer Saraban Tohura, who scored eight goals, including two hattricks in three matches, said that the biggest gain from these competitions for them is earning the courage to fight against other teams. \"When I first went outside the country, during the U-14 AFC Regional Championships final in Nepal in 2015, I cried. I was afraid when I had to board a lift for the first time. But now after playing so much in different tournaments we have got used to these things,\" the youngster from Kalshindur in Mymensingh said. \"We used to have neck-and-neck fights with teams like Iran. But this time we have beaten Iran 8-1. So we have the courage now when we take on other teams,\" she added."

The operator received 4G licence on February 19, and till date its 4G coverage has been extended to seven major cities, he said. Currently, a few lakh of its 3.20 crore customers are getting the 4G services and the number is increasing by 20,000 to 25,000 on an average every day.  The operator faced huge challenges last year for flood along with low spectrum coverage, especially in 3G service, but it has overcome the situation, Aas said. \"We had serious quality issue last year and have made a remarkable advancement in ensuring better customer experience by upgrading network capacity this month,\" he said. The initial target is to provide customers with the latest service by Ramadan in June, he added. Banglalink has recently increased the amount of its total spectrum by 53 percent by acquiring 10.6 MHz spectrum at over Tk 3,000 crore, which will give the operator a huge mileage, he said. \"Now we are focusing on digital services which will also push customers to empower their digital life.\" The 4G services will play a vital role in boosting socio-economic growth of the country by facilitating healthcare services, remote education, transportation and financial services, he said. The super-fast mobile internet provided by 4G network will enable the users to enjoy zero-buffer high definition (HD) video streaming, HD quality video calling, high-fidelity music streaming, online gaming, social networking and all sorts of other internet services. Banglalink also reiterated that they would invest $1 billion over the next three years which would give a huge boost to their customers. \"Not only Banglalink, no operator has profited from the 3G business and it will take time to get returns from the 4G investment as well,\" said Aas. Providing 4G requires a very expensive network to build but at the same time, this will give users a huge boost in availing different digital services. Mike Michel, chief marketing officer, and Taimur Rahman, chief corporate and regulatory affairs officer, were also present."

      "text": "He was hardly known to outsiders until his father, General Ziaur Rahman who became Bangladesh's president in the process of several coups and counter-coups, died in another military putsch in May 1981. For the first time, through a Bangladesh Television programme \"Jodi Kichhu Money Na Koren\", the countrymen came to know Zia had two sons and one of them Tarique Rahman. For one reason or another, the general did not expose his family to much public interactions. Tarique grew up in the shadow of his mother Khaleda Zia and was hardly visible until 2001 when the country was heading for another election, a routinely tense time for the two main power contenders -- the Awami League and BNP. The Awami League was in power then and the BNP seemed directionless and lacking the political steam. It was then that a young Tarique suddenly came to the rescue and took charge of BNP's political future. Starting with BNP's manifesto to conducting of the election, everything fell into place. With the election victory, Tarique emerged as the new \"Zia\" and heir apparent. The rest was history. He later flung BNP into such an arrogant, repressive, corrupt and aggressive path that it ultimately upended the party in a few years time. In true sense, everything was up and easy for him -- there was little doubt in people's mind that given the legacy power politics he would one day soon lay his claim on the country's leadership. There was nothing to keep him off the job of prime minister. But then that was not to happen because of his own doing. For the first time in Bangladesh's political history, parliament was completing its full five-year term from 1996 to 2001 and another parliamentary election was coming. The Awami League government had tackled the economy quite well in the aftershock of a devastating flood of 1998 that had drowned three-fourths of the country. The  government was proactive on contentious issues (remember Syed Abul Hossain lost his minister's post after media reported his having two passports or a minister losing his job because of outcry over the eviction of a slum?) . But then as the election years approached, AL became restless and took a hard line on the BNP (remember how Khaleda's road march was blocked at Narayanganj by Shamim Osman or the violent rise of Joynal Hazari in Feni or Abul Taher's criminal activities in Laxmipur or AHM Iqbal's brandishing a handgun from a procession in Dhaka?). For the BNP, there was no big political issue this time to go for a vigorous movement, as is customary in Bangladesh politics before any elections.  Just in the previous election in 1996 when Awami League was in opposition, it had marshalled a wider coalition, demanding a caretaker government, and called frequent hartal for months, ultimately getting its way and establishing an election time non-partisan  caretaker government.  It was then that the 34-year-old Tarique stepped in. With a promise of young leadership and dynamism in party, he set up his office in Hawa Bhaban, a two-storey building in Gulshan, with the election in view. It, however, did not take time for Hawa Bhaban to stand as a simile for corruption, reckless power abuse and terrorism. Tarique would sit on the first floor of Hawa Bhaban where he would invite academics, political thinkers, former ambassadors and journalists and try to convince them about the authenticity and necessity of the politics that BNP represented. He would discuss with them how BNP should see itself in the future, how to best abase Awami League, what communication strategies should BNP follow to win voters' hearts and so on. As an election strategy, Tarique then oversaw the formation of a coalition between BNP and Jamaat along with Jatiya Party and Islami Oikya Jote and embarked on a whirlwind tour of districts, meeting grassroots and young leaders. Soon there was a frenzy around him and a group of young leaders, \"educated and energetic\", were attracted to him like bees to honey. It became a usual scene to find Tarique himself driving his SUV surrounded and followed by young supporters, waving to the crowds in the hallmark style of his father. Full-throated slogans were chanted -- \"Tarique tumi egiye cholo, amra achhi tomar sathey\" (Tarique you march forward, we are with you), \"Moder neta Tarique Zia\" (Our leader is Tarique Zia -- people ultimately started using his father's name as a suffix). A signpost went up on the wall of the BNP party office that said: \"Ziaur Rahman WAS our leader, Khaleda Zia IS our leader and Tarique Rahman WILL BE our leader.\" There was now no doubt that he was the heir apparent in the legacy politics.  In the party Tarique held overwhelming authority as the son of Khaleda and he harboured a special disdain for the senior party men who he would openly chide as \"old fashioned\" and without spirit. The senior leaders grudgingly accepted his leadership and knew their political career now depended on this young man's whims no matter what their experience and contribution to the party was. They started talking to him literally with \"folded hands\" and with \"due respect\", not daring to even point out the weaknesses in his strategy. BNP's leadership became kneecapped to this young man in his thirties. On a same breath, Tarique churned out some political surprises when he visited Tungipara and prayed before the grave of Bangabandhu. This reconciliatory gesture was widely praised as a sign of new wind in politics. As the election neared, BNP unveiled a smart manifesto, outcome of an intense effort by Tarique, with a focus on making Bangladesh an IT savvy country. As the 2001 election result came out, the verdict was overwhelmingly in favour of BNP that alone bagged 193 seats and the BNP-led alliance together gained a two-thirds majority in parliament. Tarique basked in the glory of his achievement. But that glory did not take much time to fade and turn into disgrace as power came home. His mother Khaleda Zia heading the government, Tarique soon turned his Hawa Bhaban as an alternative power house, dictating state affairs from there. He found a state minister for home in Lutfozzaman Babar who had a murky past and popularly known as Casio Babar because of his alleged link to smuggling of watches.  He had his trusted \"young men\" as state and deputy ministers and commanded an army of sycophants who swarmed around him in Hawa Bhaban. They knew where the power lay. Simultaneously, Tarique cobbled around him a group of curious people such as Giasuddin Mamun, his old time buddy along with  Ruhul Quddus Dulu, Nadim Mustafa, Aminul Huq and  Alamgir Kabir among a few. These political leaders from the northern districts had deep links to Islamic militants in the region and echoed the political vision of Tarique. Tarique found them to be a valuable weapon against the liberally-branded Awami League. But Mamun stood for something else. This crafty man knew how to spin money from every deal and that exactly matched Tarique's craving for wealth.  The message went to the business world as well -- if you want to do any business, you better get blessings of the Hawa Bhaban. Giasuddin Mamun took up a new role. He became the front man to negotiate deals and collect rents. Any big public tenders had to be negotiated through certain henchmen. For example, a former Chhatra League leader who died a few years back of a heart attack looked after the roads and highways contracts.    The corruption of Tarique and his cronies became so widespread that then prime minister Khaleda Zia's principal secretary Kamaluddin Siddiqui during a meeting with US ambassador Harry K Thomas on March 13, 2005 mentioned \"PM Zia's indulgence and protection of her corrupt son\" as her \"biggest political failure\", a WikiLeaks disclosure in 2011 of a US cable reveals. US ambassador James F Moriarty cabled to Washington on November 3, 2008 mentioning that Tarique represents the symbol of \"kleptocratic government and violent politics\". The cable was leaked by WikiLeaks on August 30, 2011. \"His theft of millions of dollars in public money has undermined political stability in this moderate, Muslim-majority nation and subverted US attempts to foster a stable democratic government, a key objective in this strategically important region,\" reads the cable. His cable further mentioned Tarique as \"notorious for flagrantly and frequently demanding bribes in connection with government procurement actions and appoints to political office\". Moriarty also suggested that Tarique be denied entry to the US for his links to corruption and terrorism. Another cable sent six months later by US Charge d affairs Geeta Pasi said the State Department was considering visa revocation for him under the Presidential Proclamation. Allegations of extortion and bribe taking went rife against Tarique and much later when BNP was dislodged from power at least 23 cases were filed against him on such charges which are now under trial. He was convicted to seven years in jail and Tk 20 crore in fines in a money laundering case in 2016 which in short concerns Tarique used his political power to help his close friend, Giasuddin Mamun, to get and then launder $2.5m. Mamun had taken the money as a bribe for securing a power plant contract for a construction company. The FBI investigated this particular case of money laundering and for the first time in the history of Bangladesh, a FBI special agent testified in a Dhaka court. Tarique was sentenced to ten years in another case in February this year -- Zia orphanage graft case.  In other cases, the charges against him run like this. He had threatened the boss of a construction firm, Al Amin Construction, with closure of the company unless he received a payment of $150,000. A number of other construction firms also came up with similar allegations against him. He had received 2 percent of all the deals that a famous German company bagged during the BNP regime. A Chinese firm paid $750,000 to Tarique to open its plant and the money was deposited with a Citibank account in Singapore. A Bangladesh construction firm paid $450,000 to secure a deal. The long list of allegations thus goes on and on, indicating the blatant and crude style of power abuse. It was how Tarique built up an empire based on wealth, greed, corruption and raw muscle power. As he exercised his power to amass wealth, there was no doubt in public mind that he would sooner or later become the prime minister of Bangladesh. He was one election wonder boy turning power hungry and considering the country to be his for the taking. He was now the senior joint secretary of the party and virtually calling the shots. With wealth and power flowing in, he then took interest in another sinister matter -- patronising militants. His followers Aminul Huq, a minister; Nadim Mostafa, a lawmaker;  and Alamgir Kabir, a state minister, took the lead and started using a so-called Islamic militant group Jagrata Muslim Bangladesh led by Bangla Bhai in unleashing a reign of terror in the northern districts. The group started openly lynching people in the name of religion. The state denied media reports when these activities were brought to light.  Khaleda Zia while exchanging views with editors in August 2004 said Bangla Bhai did not exist, parroting what her state minister Babar and industries minister Motiur Rahman Nizami earlier stated just a month ago.  Nizami even went on to say \"Bangla Bhai was created by some newspapers\", hinting at The Daily Star and Prothom Alo that did most of the stories on Bangla Bhai. Much later after the end of the BNP rule, inspector general of police Nur Mohammad in an interview with The Daily Star in June 2007 said: \"From whatever I could know, former prime minister Khaleda Zia had the consent to the JMB activities.  Her son Tarique Rahman had been supporting the vigilante activities of the militants.\" But something even darker was swirling in his mind. Something hateful and murderous of grotesque proportion. It was midway through the BNP tenure and history so far had shown that no party in power could win for a second consecutive time, But Tarique wanted to win the election anyhow and one easy way was to annihilate Awami League. A sinister Islamist terrorist group named Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami or Huji had surfaced in Bangladesh when BNP was in power with the participation of Afghan war Mujahedeens through an open press conference at the National Press Club on April 30, 1992. The group was shrouded in mystery as it had supports from some pro-Israel elements and much later an American, Richard L Benkin, campaigned across the globe for Huji after it formed a political wing called Islamic Democratic Party (IDP), portraying it as an Islamist party that can bridge the gap between different faiths. He himself was of a Jewish faith. Adviser to IDP Kazi Azizul Huq told this to The Daily Star which was later confirmed by Benkin through an email to this newspaper in 2008. The terrorist outfit had no problem in doing its politics with BNP's support and tolerance. It was the same Huji that had tried to kill Sheikh Hasina, who was then prime minister, in 2000 when it planted a 76kg bomb at a rally venue in Gopalganj.  Huji leader Mufti Hannan, who later played the key role in the August 21 grenade attack, was given death penalty last year in this case. So Tarique considered Huji as the ideal group to be used to eliminate Sheikh Hasina and AL leadership. A few days before the grenade attack, he held two meetings with the Huji men at the Hawa Bhaban and assured them all the support needed to carry out the crime, the investigators of the August 21 grenade attack revealed. Huji leader Mufti Hannan, who was hanged last year for grenade attack on former British high commissioner Anwar Chowdhury in Sylhet in 2004, had been given the charge to execute the plan. Hannan was assured that he would remain above the law. The rest is history. On the fateful day of August 21, Awami League had organized an anti-terrorism rally in Bangabandhu Avenue. As Sheikh Hasina got on a truck used as a podium to deliver her speech, grenades rained down from the buildings around. Hasina, by sheer luck, escaped death but 24 Awami League men including Ivy Rahman, wife of late president Zillur Rahman, died. It was this one single incident that changed the course of politics in Bangladesh forever. But history had its twist waiting in the wings for Tarique Rahman. Three years down the line, Tarique was arrested and unceremoniously dragged to the jail with a helmet saddled on his head and bullet-proof vest around his chest when after much uncertainty and tumult a caretaker government backed by the military came to power. The man who wielded so much of power suddenly looked scared and uncertain. From that day Tarique's future in Bangladesh politics has plunged in jeopardy and sheer uncertainty. The man for whom the most powerful post of the government was just a cakewalk had to leave the country under a deal that he would never return. And today, he is facing life term as the court verdict goes. From the crux of political power he now lives the life of a fugitive."

      "text": "A recent World Bank report--an environmental analysis of Bangladesh--should erase any remaining doubts about the critical level that environmental pollution has reached in the country. The report titled \"Enhancing Opportunities for Clean and Resilient Growth in Urban Bangladesh\" should be an eye-opener for policymakers who seem to have had their eyes set on boosting economic growth alone without paying attention to the concomitant environmental costs. The data shows that deaths caused by pollution in 2015 in Bangladesh stand at 28 percent--the highest in South Asia. In the same year, there were around 234,000 deaths due to environmental pollution and related health risks, including 80,000 in urban areas. This is more than ten times the number of deaths resulting from road accidents in 2015. That the environmental situation has come to this is hardly surprising. The filthy outside air that the average Dhaka dweller has become so accustomed to breathing is just one of the daily manifestations of the city's worsening environmental conditions. This is a major reason behind Dhaka slipping down in the Economist Intelligence Unit's liveability index. It went from being the fourth least liveable city in 2017 to being the second worst this year--now ranked only one notch above war-torn Damascus. Despite there being more than 25 environment-related laws, policies and guidelines, pollution in the country has increased dramatically in the last few decades. While the list of factors responsible for the exponential rise in pollution is a long one, the underlying problems are a culture of non-implementation of existing laws and a general mindset of total disregard for the environment. In the absence of implementation of relevant laws, the effects of the dual threat of urbanisation and industrialisation to the environment have been far-reaching, particularly for the capital Dhaka. For urban planners and city engineers, modern-day Dhaka serves as a microcosm of urbanisation gone haywire. As people from all over the country throng to the capital, Dhaka seems to have reached its saturation point in terms of provision of basic infrastructure and services. And the impact on the living conditions of Dhaka as a result has been devastating. Although urbanisation and increase in income levels are thought to be accompanied by a remarkable improvement in the standard of living--and this has been the case for a sizeable population of the country--the resulting environmental impact has now reached an unbearable level that threatens to undo much of what we have achieved. It is the lower strata of society that is bearing the brunt of the consequences of the environmental havoc being wreaked by unplanned urbanisation. For instance, in Dhaka, heavy metal-contaminated sites are mostly located in poorer neighbourhoods--making the poor extremely vulnerable to lead contamination. This can lead to IQ loss in children and increases the risk of miscarriages and stillbirths for pregnant women. The fact that low-income groups are disproportionately faced with many such deadly health risks has repeatedly been highlighted by researchers over the years but sadly very little has been done to address these concerns. Urban slums--a modern-day paradox of cities' growth--are mushrooming and so is their population. According to World Bank, the latter is growing at double the average urban rate, which means that the situation will only get worse if the myriad issues affecting slum dwellers' living conditions continue to be neglected. Lack of basic hygiene and sanitation and clean drinking water, for instance, are some of the most pressing issues in Dhaka's slums. A study conducted early last year came up with this startling finding: water samples collected by slum dwellers from the last delivery point had 99 percent faecal contamination. There are many reasons for this including a network of ageing damaged underground pipelines, lack of waste disposal mechanisms and a poorly managed sewerage system. This is perhaps what you'd call unplanned urbanisation at its worst. The current trend of urbanisation in Bangladesh, if allowed to continue in the years to come, would spell death for its cities' liveability. Estimates already show that the national urban population rate is expected to increase from 28 percent of the country's entire population today to 40 percent by 2025 (World Bank, 2015). This means that almost half of Bangladesh's population will be living in cities only seven years from now. We are already witnessing the horrific consequences of decades and decades of encroachment upon wetlands, destruction of rivers and filling up of low-lying areas in the capital--the worsening waterlogging situation every year after only minutes of rain being one of them. Whereas countries around the world are increasingly prioritising proper urban planning--including green infrastructure and low-carbon solutions to urban mobility--urbanisation in Bangladesh is being led by thoughtless development. On paper, good plans do exist--but they are just not being properly implemented. For instance, most of the conservable flood flow zones earmarked in the detailed area plan (DAP) published in an official gazette in 2010 were filled up giving into demands of real estate developers. Not much progress has been made either with regard to making greater Dhaka pedestrian-friendly despite this being one of the focal points of the Strategic Transport Plan. Environmental degradation is one of the unfortunate by-products of 21st-century urbanisation and industrialisation. And so aspirations of higher economic growth must be based on a smart urban development model that takes into account environmental concerns. In the context of Bangladesh, this would require empowering and reforming institutions at the national level. One of the many recommendations made in the World Bank report is reforming the Department of Environment and equipping it with adequate resources and skilled staff in order to respond effectively to environmental issues. Another oft-repeated point made in regard to urban planning and environmental management in Bangladesh is the need to decentralise. This cannot be highlighted enough. Decentralising to division and district levels is the need of the hour so that the areas with the highest levels of pollution can be prioritised. Similarly, a lack of local-level urban planning partially explains why unplanned urbanisation in the country has spiralled out of control. Departmental and ministerial coordination is yet another longstanding problem that just can't seem to be solved. This not only hampers implementation of existing plans but also leads to confusion and gives leeway to departments and agencies to play the blame game and evade accountability--as is the case every time the city becomes inundated after minutes of rainfall and Wasa and Dhaka city corporations keep passing the buck to one another. The severe environmental impact on Dhaka and other cities cannot simply be passed off as a result of rural-to-urban migration--it's a direct consequence of thoughtless urbanisation. It is a result of the lack of an urban development model that puts people, their wellbeing and the environment first. The lack of accountability and transparency in the way many of the existing plans are being implemented--if at all--continues to be a major thorn in our side. It's time policymakers understood that urbanisation and growth and the liveability of a city are not mutually exclusive, and thus environmental degradation cannot simply be swept aside or justified as an \"inevitable\" by-product of growth. The slow environmental destruction we are witnessing today is the consequence of a failure to plan for and execute a vision of a liveable city.

      "text": "South Africa is fighting to revive its frayed clothing industry, once a crucial provider of jobs in a country suffering from high unemployment, as a flood of cheap imports forces local factories to shutter and lay off workers. Once the economic lifeblood of many small regional towns, the abundance of cheaper products from China has led to the loss of nearly two-thirds of the sector's jobs over the past two decades. \"After being employed for 22 years we were informed that the factory would close down in eight weeks,\" said Vimla Padayachee, 46, who lost her job three years ago. The clothing factory in Verulam, north of the port city of Durban, shut down after years of battling low demand for its products. \"A person of my age is not likely to get another job again, and so are my colleagues,\" she said. The former seamstress is one of thousands of clothing sector workers who have been made redundant, in a country where official unemployment is nearly 30 percent. The dire situation forced the government to intervene while business has called for a radical policy overhaul to stem the crisis. Inside a bustling factory in Maitland near Cape Town, workers bowed in front of rows of whirring sewing machines, stitching at a brisk pace to fulfil daily orders from a local chain store. It is one of the producers benefitting from government grants and loans designed to help companies recapitalise their operations. \"We've had a very rocky ride, and we have lost ground to the rest of the world,\" said Christopher Kinross, who runs a clothing company that bears his name and employs 253 people. \"The industry is stagnant at the moment.\"Kinross, who has been in the industry for more than 50 years, said the government's scheme had brought \"some stability\". But he stresses that more had to be done to promote competition and create jobs. \"There is no doubt that there is a will to help the industry... but the problems go beyond the influx of imports,\" said Kinross. One of the main challenges facing the industry is a tax on importing raw materials essential for manufacturers. \"We pay 22 percent duty on imported fabrics... if they remove that duty, our businesses could grow in a spectacular fashion,\" he said. \"The industry has an amazing potential to create jobs but that is not happening.\" Years of talks to remove the duty have been unsuccessful and there are no quotas on clothing imports. South Africa's textiles and clothing sector contributes 3.3 percent to the nation's overall economic output -- and is heavily reliant on domestic consumption. Foreign investment in apparel has repeatedly bypassed South Africa and instead gone to Lesotho, Swaziland and Madagascar, among other African nations. \"We pay wage levels that are relatively high for clothing manufacturing countries,\" said Kinross. As much as 45 percent of sector income is spent on labour costs, he added. Only textile businesses that agree to pay a minimum wage set by the government qualify for official assistance. The support for the industry has been running for six years, supporting 505 beneficiaries and distributing 5.3 billion rand ($390 million). \"Whatever is needed to be done to protect the industry, it must be done,\" said Rob Davies, the trade minister. \"But it should be in the interest of industry development and to improve the local supplier base.\" The arrival of giant international \"fast fashion\" brands such as H&M and Zara opened another front in the battle being fought by South African clothing manufacturers. Fast fashion retailers, which largely source their products from outside South Africa, have aggressively expanded in the country in recent years -- denting sales of locally made garments. In November, the Southern African Clothing & Textile Workers Union staged protests outside malls across the country to pressure retailers to buy locally. \"These foreign retailers cause fewer orders in South African factories which contributes to local (redundancies) and factory closures,\" the union said. Despite the challenges facing the sector, but the green shoots of recovery are starting to be seen. \"In almost 15 years we have probably lost somewhere between around 160,000 - 170,000 jobs, but from around 2011 (job losses) began to taper off -- and within the last 18 months we have seen it pick up,\" said Simon Appel, an industry researcher. \"A decline in retail sales is causing a devastation in the local industry,\" he said, adding that boosting exports would be vital to turning around the situation. \"Our industry is struggling to break back into the export market.\""

      "text": "Due to freshly deposited silt in the Jamuna river, ferry services along the Balashi Ghat terminal in Gaibandha and Bahadurabad Ghat terminal in Jamalpur are almost at a halt. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) carried out dredging in the river last year to increase navigability. But during monsoon this year sediments again found their ways into the river bringing down the water level at many points. As a result, a plan of BIWTA to create road link between northern districts and Dhaka by placing barges (large, flat-bottomed boat for carrying heavy freight on rivers, canals) is now in limbo. The pontoon at Balashi Ghat is currently lying inactive. The terminal is mostly used to carry passengers and goods to the capital from northern districts. Communication via different routes of the Jamuna river gets largely disrupted every winter as water level goes down drastically. At some points, it becomes knee-deep making it impossible for vessels to move. Vessels run into shoals and get stuck, according to local boatmen. Everyday hundreds of people travel to different destinations by engine boats from Balashi Ghat. The terminal connects Gaibandha town to Sundarganj, Fulchhari and Sagata upazilas of the district. It also connects the town with Chilmari, Raumari and Rajibpur upazilas of Kurigram, Sariakandi and Sonatola of Bogura, and Dewanganj and Islampur of Jamalpur, according to Gaibandha District Council. Navigability on the routes are almost lost as water flow from the upstream has gone thinner over time, said locals. \"In rainy season, it takes only one-and-a-half hour to reach Bahadurabad Ghat but in dry season it takes three to four hours,\" said Abdul Hye, a boatman of Kalasona Char in Fulchhari. \"We thought that navigability would be restored by excavation, but flood again brought silt from upstream and the situation went back to square one,\" said boatman Jamaluddin of Balashi Ghat. \"Passengers cannot reach their destinations on time in winter, as a number of shoals develop in the riverbed impeding movement of country boats,\" Asaduzzaman Hashu, leaseholder of the terminal, told this paper. Moklesur Rahman, executive engineer of Bangladesh Water Development Board, Gaibandha, said, \"We need a master plan to do dredging in such a way that ferry channels remain navigable throughout the year.\" During British rule, railway authorities had launched train ferry services in the Jamuna. Following the construction of Bangabandhu Bridge, the railway ferry services between Balashi Ghat and Bahadurabad Ghat was withdrawn in 2005."

The key roads including Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, Green Road, Rajabazar, Bangabazar went under knee water resulting in thousands of commuters to suffer in the traffic jams, reports our staff photographers from the spot. Additionally, hundreds of vehicles on the roads were seen stranded for hours in the traffic jams. Meanwhile, the entrance of the administrative building at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) and some rooms of the hospital's morgue got waterlogged due to the downpour, said Sekendar Ali, morgue assistant at the DMCH. The capital Dhaka witnessed 19 millimetres rain from 2:00pm to 6:00pm, Shahinul Islam, meteorologist of the Bangladesh Meteorological Department, told The Daily Star. The rains may continue for three more days across the country, including the capital, he said. The Met office recorded sporadic rainfall across the country and the highest rainfall was recorded in Sylhet at 33.3mm, Shahinul Islam added. According to the Met office, light to moderate rain/thunder showers accompanied by temporary gusty wind is likely to occur at most places over Khulna, Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions at many places over Dhaka and Mymensingh divisions and at a few places over Barishal, Chattogram and Sylhet divisions with moderately heavy to heavy falls at places over the country."

Ongoing global trade war and geopolitical tensions are uncertainties in the external front that may or may not impair attainment of BB's FY20 monetary program outcomes, the governor added. The Bangladesh Bank will be closely monitoring the risk factors to attainment of FY20 monetary program objectives and will address them if the need arises. The BB's FY20 monetary policy stance and monetary program will cautiously accommodate monetary and credit expansion needs of all productive pursuits for attaining the FY20 real GDP growth target of 8.2 percent. They will also keep the CPI inflation contained within the targeted ceiling of 5.5 percent. \"Recent upward revision of fuel gas prices and new VAT law implementation has already imparted some impact on prices in the beginning of FY20 and the lingering effect over the coming month remains to be seen,\" he further said."

The sandy shoals that were nowhere near fertility, are now yielding different kinds of vegetables and Robi crops (crops that are sown in winter and harvested in spring). The change is visible in 70 percent of the shoals in six unions under Sundarganj upazila, according to the district agriculture department. \"Alluvial soil flow from the upstream with flood water and deposit on the shoals during rainy season. As a result, the shoals no longer go under Teesta river and become fertile instead,\" explained Sundarganj Upazila Agriculture Officer (UAO) Syed Reza-e-Mahmud. Hashem Ali grows chilli and maize on his five bigha land in Lalchamar char. Last year he earned Tk 27,000 through maize cultivation and this year he is looking forward to earning profit particularly from the chillies. \"Five years ago, it was unimaginable that crops and vegetables will grow here. The residents used to rear cattle, do fishing or other petty jobs but now the situation has drastically changed,\" Ali told this paper. During monsoons, the char dwellers have no option but to leave their homes with cattle and little belongings. But unlike before, now they get back in dry season to take up contractual works in croplands.  Three years ago, Mottaleb Ali left Badamer char due to river erosion. But he returned after hearing about the changes in the quality of soil and now works as a labourer at a maize field. In 2012, an international Non-Government Organisation (NGO) started growing pumpkins on the sandy chars of Gaibandha. They filled up sacks with fertile soil and buried those under the sands. The success of the project encouraged locals. \"Living standard of people in these chars have gone high with cultivation of Rabi crops,\" said Sundarganj UAO Mahmud. Rafiqul Islam, a landless farmer of Madaripara char, earned Tk 45,000 last year by cultivating pumpkin on two bighas of land. This year, he ploughed three bighas under sharecropping. Winter vegetables mostly grow in these chars during dry season. Boro paddy, wheat, maize, pulse, chilli, and pumpkin are among other produces. \"I have cultivated chillies on one-and-a-half-bigha land. Last year I had earned Tk 35,000 by cultivating chillies on one bigha land. This year I am expecting more profit,\" said Khaiber Hossain of Putimari char. \"Char people used to grow millet grains like kaon, cheena, teel, and Boro paddy in small scale. They never thought of cultivating anything else. It was the pumpkin farming that showed them the way,\" said Belka Union Council Chairman Md Ibrahim."

He said the directives were issued in line with instructions of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, now on an official visit to the UK, from where she was monitoring the current flood situation as well. Islam said the premier simultaneously instructed the officials concerned to minimise sufferings of the deluge victims alongside damages feared to be caused by the flood. He said representatives from the concerned ministries and city corporations also came up with various opinions and spelled out their strategies to check rumours, dengue and face the flood. Principal Coordinator of SDG Affairs at the PMO Md Abul Kalam Azad and Executive Chairman of Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) Kazi M Aminul Islam were, among others, who joined the meeting chaired by PMO Secretary Sajjadul Hassan. \"The PMO asked the authorities concerned of the two Dhaka city corporations to strengthen their anti-mosquito drives to check dengue,\" the spokesman said. It also instructed the health authorities to form a special medical team in each city hospital to ensure smooth and proper treatment for the dengue patients. Decision was also taken to observe a dengue \"awareness week\" from Thursday. The PMO asked all government officials to clean their respective offices and to prevent dengue alongside motivating people to keep their residences and neighbourhoods clean by removing stagnant clean water from different pots, particularly flower tubes, air conditioner machines and refrigerators."

      "text": "While our higher judiciary has no original jurisdiction on environment matters, its writ jurisdiction has been frequently invoked in the last few decades for protecting and preserving our environment. On the occasion of 5th June, the World Environment Day, let us revisit some notable decisions of our apex judiciary on environment matters.  HCD declares rivers as 'legal persons' Following a report in The Daily Star titled - 'Time to declare Turag dead', Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh filed a writ petition on the legality of earth filling, encroachment and development of structures along the banks of Turag river. Thereafter, the HCD accorded legal entity to Turag along with all the other rivers of Bangladesh, in a bid to save our rivers from being polluted and encroached upon. Liberalising the concept of 'locus standi' In Dr. Mohiuddin Farooque v Bangladesh (1995), our judiciary paved the way for public interest litigation by liberally interpreting the terms \"person aggrieved\" as anyone who, despite not being personally affected, has sufficient interest in the subject matter. The petition was filed challenging the legality of the experimental project of the Flood Action Plan (FAP) in Tangail. Following the court verdict, the government reformed the project, doing away with the initial scheme, and also introduced environmental impact assessment plan consulting the local people.    First instance of judicial recognition for environment protection Before the insertion of Article 18A via the 15th Amendment, there was no constitutional provision for the protection of the environment. Thus, Dr. Mohiuddin Farooque v Bangladesh (1996) became the first instance of the judicial recognition of the protection of the environment. The petition was filed challenging the nuisance and sound population during the campaign for the 1996 general elections. The court ordered the Attorney General to take necessary steps for preventing damages to public and private property in the guise of election campaigning.        HCD orders phasing out of two stroke motor vehicles Owing to the environmental hazards caused by two stroke three wheelers in Dhaka via smoke emissions and excessively shrill horns, Dr. Mohiuddin Farooque filed another writ petition seeking implementation of the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1983. The HCD recognised that a pollution free environment is a component of the right to life guaranteed under the Constitution. Hence, it ordered the government to phase out the two stroke three wheelers and replace them with cleaner alternatives by December 2003. This verdict has led to CNG auto rickshaws being fielded in our streets ever since. SC orders government to ensure safe drinking water In Rabia Bhuiyan, MP v Ministry of LGRD & others, the writ petition was filed regarding the failure of the government to seal tube-wells contaminated with arsenic. The court acknowledged the extreme gravity of the situation and the health hazards of consuming arsenic-contaminated water by the public. It linked environment pollution to violation of the right to life under the Constitution and the need to improve the environment to uphold this right. SC prohibits the construction of multi-storied shopping mall in violation of Dhaka City Master Plan In Sharif Nurul Ambia v Dhaka City Corporation, the SC ordered to stop the construction of a 10-storied shopping complex in the reserved place for public car parking in the Master Plan of greater Dhaka, despite the activities that the respondents had carried out so far. It held that the construction began without any approval of the building plan and it would be detrimental to public health by causing traffic congestion and blocking the free passage of air and light in the area.    SC orders eviction of tanneries from Hazaribagh In 2017, the SC upheld the eviction order of 155 tanneries from Hazaribagh and fined BDT 55,000/- each for polluting the neighbourhood and the Buriganga river. Environmentalists and the government had rallied against their operation and advocated for their relocation. A follow-up report in 2019 revealed that the tanneries had moved out of Hazaribagh. RAJUK now plans to construct parks, playgrounds, community halls, shopping malls and a site for indoor games in the area.   The writer is a student of law, University of Dhaka.  "

The damage of infrastructure including roads, bridges and culverts in the district amounts to Tk 209 crores and the figure may rise when the final assessment is done after flood water recedes completely, according to Local Government Engineering Department (LGED).  So far, the LGED has assessed that about 817 kilometres of the district's 275 roads have been damaged by the flood. In addition, the number of damaged bridges in the district now stands at 96. Total number of culverts assessed to have been damaged is 1,119. Another 30 kilometres of roads in the district under Roads and Highways Department (RHD) were also assessed to be damaged by the flood. The damage incurred by the LGED is estimated at Tk 194 crore, while it is Tk 15 crore by the RHD.   Most roads were damaged by torrential rain and surge of water from hills, while many other roads degenerated due to submersion.    As per the LGED, 185 km of road were damaged in Doarabazar upazila, 45 km in Shalla upazila, 60 km in Sunamganj Sadar, 126 km in South Sunamganj, 28 km in Derai, 168 km in Bishwambharpur, 16 km in Tahirpur, 6 km in Jamalganj, , 75 km in Jagannathpur, 50 km in Dharampasha and 58 km in Chhatak upazila. Asphalt upper layer of most of these roads have been washed away. Many other roads have developed large craters and potholes all over.  Munem Mia, an auto-rickshaw driver in Tahirpur upazila, said the road damage is so extensive that vehicles are getting into accidents frequently. LGED Senior Assistant Engineer in Sunamganj Anwar Hossain said roads in many upazilas are still under water and a more accurate assessment of damage would be possible only after the water recedes completely. The repair work on the damaged roads would start after the authorities allocate necessary funds, he also said. RHD Executive Engineer in Sunamganj Shafiqul Islam said Sunamganj-Sachna, Sunamganj-Kachirgati, Chhatak-Doarabazar and Anwarpur-Tahirpur roads are among the 30 km of damaged roads under RHD. He also said his department already started urgent repair work on some of the roads and they would complete elaborate repair work on the roads once the flood situation improves."

      "text": "At least two century-old rail bridges on Santahar-Lalmonirhat rail tracks, which connects the capital with cities in northern districts, continue to be in service despite their ramshackle state. On the same tracks, there are six other run-down bridges, also built during the British era, that require immediate attention of the authorities. Among the two risky bridges, one is located in Bheramara over the Ghaghot river near Gaibandha rail station's south outer signal. The other one is at Badiakhali rail station. The last one sustained heavy damage during the recent flood.   As many as 14 trains including four intercity express trains pass the bridges every day at an exceedingly reduced speed as a cautionary measure.   Abul Kashem, station master of Gaibandha rail station, told this correspondent that the rail authorities deployed a watchman at the Bheramara bridge to ensure the trains slow down while crossing it due to its appalling shape. The bridge near Badiakhali rail station in Gaibandha is also in a deplorable condition. A section of it was washed away during last flood, suspending rail communications for three weeks. The bridges were built with lime and brick dust during the British rule, nearly 120 years ago. Cracks have developed in a number of bridge piers and many of the wooden slippers and metal parts on the bridges have worn out, the station master also said. A frequent train traveller and a private firm employee, Monwara Begum, said train passengers spend nervous time in their seats while the train moves on the bridges at a snail's pace. Atwar Hossain, a signal man at the Bheramara bridge, said before an approaching train gets on the bridge, he stops it by waving a red flag. He then gets signature of the train driver before allowing the train to cross the bridge at a speed of 10 miles per hour.   Bangladesh Railway's Sub-Assistant Engineer Afzal Hossain at Bamondanga rail station said there are eight large and small bridges along the route and out of those, the ones in Bheramara and Badiakhali need immediate repair as those are in a vulnerable state. Anower Hossain, divisional railway engineer in Lalmonirhat Division, said they already floated tender for complete overhaul of the bridges and the works will start soon."

The officials of Bangladesh Water Development Board said water level of the Brahmaputra river rose by 10 cm in last 24 hours and was flowing 53 cm above its danger mark at Fulchharighat point of the district this morning at 6:00 am. On the other hand, the Ghagot river also experienced rise by five cm during the period and was flowing 27 cm above its danger level at New Bridge Road point of the district town this morning at 6:00 am. Additional deputy commissioner (General) Alamgir Kabir Saikat said around six lakh people of Sundarganj, Sadar, Fulchhari, Shaghata and Gobindaganj upazilas of the district have been marooned.  As many as 98,000 people have taken shelter at 190 schools, colleges and madrassas which are being used as flood shelter centers, he also said. Apart from it, thousands of flood victims have taken shelter at the government embankments, higher places and relatives' houses with domestic animals, poultry birds and other belongings, he added. Deputy director of Department of Agriculture Extension Dr Sarder M Ferdous said standing crops including T-Aman seed bed, Aus paddy, summer vegetables, and betel-leaf orchard of 14,021 hectares of land had been damaged due to on-going flood. District fisheries officer Abdud Dayan Dulu said fishes of TK 28.90 crore of 6290 ponds owned by 5100 farmers of the district had been washed away due to the flood. To mitigate the sufferings of the flood victims, relief distribution activity by the district and the upazila administrations had also been intensified and it had been continuing for couples of weeks. Deputy commissioner (DC) Abdul Matin told the BSS that 1380 tonnes of rice, TK 21 lakh and 6000 cartoons of dry food received from Relief and Disaster Management Ministry had been distributed to the flood hit people of the district so far. TK two lakh to purchase fodder for cattle and same amount of money to purchase food for children were found from the ministry, the DC concluded."

      "text": "Dr Maminul Haque Sarker, Deputy Executive Director, Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS), talks to Naznin Tithi of The Daily Star about how early prediction can help minimise the impacts of river erosion and the importance of developing a national strategy for river erosion. We have been witnessing increasing incidents of river erosion this year, which has already devoured vast areas of croplands and homesteads of people across the country. Do you think river erosion has been causing more damage this year compared to previous years? Recently, we came across a lot of news reports in both print and electronic media about river erosion--how it has already affected a large number of people and damaged vast agricultural land and properties of people. But it cannot be said based on these reports that river erosion has particularly increased this year. When a char or agricultural land erodes, it does not get much attention from the media. But when big structures such as roads, bridges, hospitals, townships are devoured by the rivers, it becomes news. We often do not give much attention to small scale river erosion, but if we look at the erosion and damage done throughout the year, we would find that a lot of the damage remain unaccounted for. Usually, we take account of the losses and damage at the beginning of each year using dry season satellite images. We publish a prediction report annually which also includes location-wise annual monitoring of erosion and damaged infrastructure. This report is for the use of the national level stakeholders, such as the Planning Commission, BWDB (Bangladesh Water Development Board), LGED (Local Government Engineering Department), Disaster Management Bureau, etc. Analysing the time-series satellite images, we found that the annual river bank erosion along different large rivers, such as the Ganges, Jamuna and Padma, increases with the upsurge of annual peak flood discharge. Do we currently have any erosion prediction system or early warning mechanism? Also, what about developing a strategy for addressing the causes and consequences of river erosion? We at the CEGIS have been making yearly predictions for the last 15/16 years with the financial support from different projects of BWDB, WARPO (Water Resources Planning Organisation), UNDP and CEGIS. We are even giving predictions two years in advance since last year. We have seen from experience that our predictions are 70/80 percent accurate. Brac had worked in some erosion-prone areas based on our predictions and found the predictions to be 90 percent accurate. Such predictions should be a part of our river management strategy. Because these predictions and early warnings could minimise erosion or reduce the damage to properties. The government can take initiatives for river bank protection and also for the relocation of the local people who are supposed to be affected by river erosion. But it will only be helpful if the government makes a national strategy for river management and works based on the predictions. Moreover, river erosion is a natural disaster and the ministry of disaster management should be handling the issue. It is no longer a problem for the developed countries of the world, because they had taken care of the issue long ago. They have managed their rivers in a way that the rivers do not change their course anymore. However, since it is still a major issue in Bangladesh, it needs urgent attention of the authorities concerned. Could you elaborate on how the river erosion prediction system works? Understanding the morphological behaviour of braided and dynamic rivers is very important. It was found in late 1990s that time-series satellite images are very useful to understand the main rivers of Bangladesh. At the beginning of this century, CEGIS research team developed a method to predict the river bank erosion of the Jamuna River. CEGIS also developed the prediction method for the Ganges (Godagari, Rajshahi) to Aricha and Padma (Aricha to Chandpur). An interpretation of satellite images may provide huge information on the location of dry season channels, sandbar and chars (vegetated island). There are different parameters based on which the predictions are made, such as the curvature of meandering river bend, width of the river channel, approach of channel to the riverbank, location of the channel--upstream or downstream, right or left bank, starting and ending point of river bank erosion with respect to the meandering bend, etc. Several hundreds of data are extracted from the time-series satellite images and are analysed statistically. The extent of river bank erosion largely depends on the characteristics of the bank materials. Before developing the predictive tools, we have to know the properties of bank materials. Erosion also depends on the curvatures, width of channel, terrain slope and shape of upstream sandbar. We relate the extent of erosion with different parameters which provide the rules for erosion prediction. During the last one and a half decades, the accuracy of our prediction has increased significantly. By this time, we worked in India to develop tools for assessing vulnerability of different structures and river bank erosion along the Kosi River. Water Resources Department (WRD) of Bihar has been successfully using our tools for the last two years. River erosion has been affecting thousands of people annually in Bangladesh and many of the landless people have no other option but to migrate to the cities in search of a livelihood. Do you think the government's rehabilitation programmes are sustainable?  We have a database of how many people have been affected and how much land and resources have been lost to river erosion every year. But sadly, we could not take advantage of this data for lack of a proper plan. Our estimates suggest that currently river erosion affects some 55,000 people annually. Although thousands of people fall victim to river erosion every year, the affected people have little access to institutional support, and the government's measures are restricted to mostly relief distribution to the victims. It would be more effective if the vulnerable people could be taken under the government's Safety Net Programmes. It is important that the government agencies as well as the non-government organisations plan their relief efforts as well as the rehabilitation programmes based on the predictions. There are NGOs which have been doing a lot of work at the community level. They are building schools and healthcare facilities for the flood and erosion affected people. But often, such facilities are built in erosion-prone areas, meaning that these structures are often washed away by the rivers within a short time. In one instance, we predicted that a certain part of an area was at risk of erosion. But an NGO built a school in that area without taking into consideration the predictions. After a year or two, the school building was devoured by a river. Such incidents can easily be avoided if the early warnings are taken into consideration. Moreover, protecting the river bank becomes much easier with an early warning mechanism in place. We can take small-scale river bank protection plans or, in some cases, go for big-budget plans. For example, in order to save the banks of the Jamuna near the Jamuna bridge, the government has undertaken some big-budget plans, because the bridge needs to be saved at all costs. However, we can undertake small-budget programmes every year to protect the river banks in the erosion prone areas.  The most important thing for the government to do now would be to formulate a national strategy. The government spends a large amount of money every year to rehabilitate the victims of river erosion across the country. By developing a national level prediction system and proper guidelines for addressing the causes and impacts of river erosion, the process could be made much easier and a lot of money could be saved, and most importantly, the sufferings of thousands of victims of river erosion could be reduced."

      "text": "Imagine that time when people had no social media and everyone was filled with doubts whether they would get a second chance to meet their dearest friend once they parted ways at the end of their school year. Well, gone are those days. Thanks to social media, we can now stay in touch with our beloved friends, even years after school ends and it is a far memory.  These days it's very common for school friends to arrange reunions. One such initiative, bringing school friends together, was started by the students who completed SSC in 2002 and HSC in 2004 in Bangladesh. A Facebook group titled \"SSC 2002 AND HSC 2004 Bangladesh\" was created way back in 2012. The members of the group arranged to meet up in the capital's Supreme Court Bar Association on July 12 marking their 8th founding anniversary. At the same time, the group's founding anniversary was celebrated in 15 countries around the world. \"This will be brilliant if it really happens. As soon as the idea struck our mind, we along with some friends opened the group without any delay,\" said Md Habibur Rahman, one of the admins of the group, adding that it has now evolved to be a very helpful platform with around 50,000 members.       On May 13 this year, an agreement was signed between Sharda Hospital in India and the Facebook group with the help of group admins. Under this agreement, members of the group and their family members will get 15 percent discount for treatment at the hospital. This special discount offer will be available only if one receives an email through the admin before visiting the hospital, said another founding admin Zakaria. The group's activities do not stop there. Penned by 15 members of the group, a book named \"02 Dugune 08 (2x2=04)\" was released at the Ekushey Boi Mela this year. Publication house Pathaghar brought out the book with a compilation of 15 short stories, dedicated to all friends of SSC 2002 AND HSC 2004 Bangladesh.   The book won 'Best Seller Award' for its contribution to the field of literature in a program arranged by Bangladesh Heritage Study and Development. In addition to that, the group also works as a networking platform, arranging jobs for unemployed friends and relatives, arranging blood donors for medical emergency, distributing relief material and warm clothes to flood victims and also bringing necessary items from abroad, said Faruk Ahmed, an active member of the group.  They also arrange group tours, cricket tournaments, iftar parties, winter cake festivals and so on.  With the help of the group's members, new clothes were distributed to around 15,000 street children during Eid-ul-Fitr under the banner of 'Silent Smile'."

This match started at 11pm local time on Wednesday in Azerbaijan, but it was Thursday by the time it came to life with a flood of second-half goals started by Olivier Giroud's 49th-minute opener against his old club. Hazard then set up Pedro Rodriguez for Chelsea's second before grabbing a double of his own -- including a penalty -- either side of Alex Iwobi's consolation for Arsenal. The Belgian is widely expected to leave Chelsea for Real Madrid after seven years in England, and this was the perfect way for him to bow out. \"I think it is a goodbye, but in football you never know,\" the 28 year-old told BT Sport. \"My dream was to play in the Premier League and I have done that for one of the biggest clubs so maybe now it is the time for a new challenge.\" It is his, and Chelsea's, second Europa League this decade, while it is Maurizio Sarri's first major trophy as a coach. \"I am really very happy but the trophy is very important for the club,\" Sarri said. \"In the Europa League we played 15 matches, won 12 and drew three, so I think we deserved to win it.\" Chelsea will be back in the Champions League next season, but there will be no return to Europe's top table for Arsenal. Unai Emery's side had to win here to qualify, yet they were not good enough on a bizarre night. Emery was hoping to win this competition for the fourth time. He will get another chance next season, but for now Arsenal's 25-year wait to bring back a European trophy to north London goes on. \"We tried and we worked but Chelsea were better than us and congratulations to them,\" Emery said. Chelsea will remember their evening with fondness, as will Sarri, who 24 hours earlier had stolen the headlines when he angrily stormed off the pitch here during a training session in front of the television cameras. \"Sarri is a great guy, a great coach and he deserves this,\" said David Luiz of his coach. The players seemed short of rhythm in a match played two and a half weeks after the Premier League season ended. It came to life though, with a moment of controversy when referee Gianluca Rocchi dismissed Arsenal appeals for a penalty as Alexandre Lacazette went down under goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga's challenge. Granit Xhaka then saw his powerful strike from 25 yards graze the crossbar as the half-hour approached. Only after that did Chelsea stir, but Petr Cech -- in his final match before retiring -- blocked Emerson Palmieri's shot and denied Giroud at the end of a fine move. However, as the clock ticked past midnight after a goalless first half, Chelsea went ahead when Giroud stole in front of Laurent Koscielny and stooped to head home Emerson's cross. It was his 11th goal in this season's competition, and there was to be no comeback from Arsenal, with Chelsea quickly putting this final beyond their opponents' reach as Hazard took over. He set up Pedro for a clipped finish beyond Cech and into the far corner on the hour mark, and five minutes later Hazard calmly rolled in a penalty awarded after Ainsley Maitland-Niles barged into Giroud. Substitute Iwobi's sublime volleyed reply followed, but Arsenal had left themselves with too much to do, and Giroud and Hazard combined brilliantly for the latter to get his second and Chelsea's fourth in the 72nd minute."

TIB executive director Dr Iftekharuzzaman said, \"Such destructive work in the name of development occurred due to lack of governance foiled by a tripartite connivance of businessmen, law enforcers and political authority.\"  "

      "text": "Ajoy Roy has worn many hats throughout his life--as a bright scientist; professor of physics; human rights and secular activist; author; and perhaps, most significant of all, as a valiant freedom fighter. It is indeed hard to come up with an example of a Bangladeshi as decorated as Prof Roy. To sum up, the life of Prof Roy epitomises the famous Kennedy dictum, \"Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\" I have been lucky enough to interact and work with this courageous man for a brief period during the 2000s while serving as a co-moderator at Mukto-Mona, the online forum for Bengali secularists and freethinkers, founded by slain secular activist, blogger and Prof Roy's son, Avijit Roy. Prof Roy had been on the advisory board of Mukto-Mona. I have seen his passion and tireless energy to help and support the voiceless, poor and powerless. Mukto-Mona activists dared to stand by human rights, freedom of expression and critical thinking. At times I paused, slowed down but not Avijit. A software engineer by training, Avijit's unofficial, 24/7 job was to not let go of anything unchallenged when it came to fighting religious bigotry and fanaticism. Beyond writing, promoting reason and science, Mukto-Mona occasionally undertook projects to help the poor and needy in remote areas, using funds made of small donations from our members. One such project was to rebuild a primary school obliterated by the devastating flood of 2004 in Roumari, a remote village in Kurigram in northern Bangladesh. Often, from Dhaka, Prof Roy and his team (activists of Shiksha Andolan Manch) would travel several hundred miles by bus, boat to the project site to monitor the progress and would report back to us with meticulous details and pictures. I always marvelled at the man who was in his late 60s yet full of stamina and the spirit of a young man. As if the call from his motherland to serve was far from over, Prof Ajoy Roy rose to the occasions whenever human rights, people's freedom of expression were attacked. He protested, spoke and wrote about the plight of minorities and freethinkers in Bangladesh and beyond, including the vicious attacks on writers such as Humayun Azad. In 2015 Avijit Roy was murdered in daylight by extremists at Ekushey book fair in Dhaka. His wife, Bonya Ahmed, was seriously wounded. Avijit was only 42 but has inspired--via his writing of many thought-provoking articles and books (even more so after his death)--hundreds of freethinkers in Bangladesh and around the world. Yet for his family, Avijit's premature death had left a void that won't fill. Never. I can only imagine and would never quite feel the pain, shock, and disappointment Prof Ajoy Roy had to endure after the murder of his son. What could be more tragic for a freedom fighter than to live with the reality that his young, brilliant son was hacked to death only because he expressed his opinions freely? I do not know what the fighting in the field felt like in 1971 for Ajoy Roy but I am sure in his wildest dreams he did not envision this tragic reality in the country that he fought for.     In 2012, the Bangladesh government bestowed upon Ajoy Roy the country's highest civilian honour, the Ekushey Padak. Though ceremonial, it was long due and a praiseworthy step. However, the administration has failed a father who, at 84 with ailing health and in a wheelchair, had been, for four years, attending the court hearing of his son's murder case without a visible headway. Tragically he had to leave this world on December 9 without getting any justice.     Jahed Ahmed lives and works in New York. Email: humanistnyc@hotmail.com"

      "text": "GPH Ispat Ltd has given a clarification in response to a report published in The Daily Star on Sunday with the headline \"Dam makeshift, damage extensive\". Following is the full text of the clarification. GPH becomes the pioneer in the country's steel sector to install the world standard Quantum Electric Arc Furnace technology. The plant will generate several thousand employments, save electricity and natural gas, a huge foreign currency, produce import alternatives of Bangladesh's Steel demand and contribute a lot to the government exchequer. In compliance with the honorable prime minister's instruction to use surface water instead of ground water, the GPH management started works accordingly to fulfill its water demand for the upcoming plant that needs almost 6 million litres of water per day in its production process. According to suggestion of the water resource ministry, GPH has already completed the feasibility study through the nationally and internationally recognised Institute of Water Modeling (IWM) for the same purpose. Further, GPH has also engaged a consultant to prepare the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report in line with IWM suggestion to secure the water demand of the plant. Once the EIA report is approved by the Department of Environment (DoE), the dam or rain water harvesting project will be taken up. Any dam, if built on the basis of approval of the EIA report, will have no negative impact on the forest, environment and neighborhood. Currently we gathered some sand bags in our own land as a pre-preparatory work of the rain water harvesting project, which is plain area inside the hill. The most important fact is that GPH did not dig any canal, nor constructed yet any makeshift dam in the reported area to divert water of the streams that may jeopardise the neighbouring environment as well as indigenous people of Tripura Palli. The people of Tripura Palli use water of the \"ChotoKumiraChara\" which has natural resources of water flow round the year. The drain owned by the GPH has been linked with this Chara which is not a canal and no natural waterflow, simply a water flow measure from hilly area to facilitate during rainy season. If the dam or rainwater harvesting project is constructed in this area, it would be beneficial for the Tripura Palli and other surrounding areas to protect them from the flood in the rainy season. Besides, the director general of the Water Development Board (BWDB) has constituted a seven-member feasibility study committee on April 21, 2019 on the construction of the environment friendly water reservoir to use the unused rainwater springing from the hills in Sitakunda and its adjacent areas. It was referred in the news report that the forest department has filed a case with Sitakunda Police Station against the GPH. Actually a complaint has been lodged by the forest department in the Judicial Magistrate Forest Court and the complaint number is 56/2019. However, we are yet to receive any notice in this regard. The fact is that the forest department is claiming a piece of land owned by GPH Ispat. So, we have lodged an application with the Sitakundaupzilanirbahi officer to solve the issue by measuring the land by government surveyors. Our Additional Managing Director Almas Shimul, who has been quoted in the story, elaborated on all the above facts to reporter Mostafa Yousuf when he met him in Chattogram earlier. Unfortunately, in our views, Shimul's comments were not reflected properly in the report. That's why we are trying to explain through this communication actually what is happening in the reported area."

      "text": "Rajshahi City Corporation has planned to reclaim around 12 square kilometres of char land of Padma river for developing a satellite town adjacent to the city protection embankment. As the river's main flow turned towards its right bank, the satellite town might be built on the left bank, Rajshahi Mayor AHM Khairuzzaman Liton told The Daily Star yesterday. He said the part of the river near the left bank, where flood water remains for less than a month every year, would be turned into a huge lake. The lake would stand between the satellite town and the city protection embankment and there would be a bridge to the newly developed city, he added. \"Rajshahi would be beautiful if we can properly execute the plan,\" the mayor said, adding that \"the city's accommodation problems will be eased as well.\" Meanwhile, the city corporation signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with China's state-owned enterprise Power Construction Corporation Limited (Power China Ltd) on Sunday to conduct feasibility studies and prepare a master plan for 50 years. Eight schemes in the MoU include building the satellite town. Mayor Liton and Han Kun, business development manager of Power China Ltd, signed the MoU at Rajshahi Nagar Bhaban's conference room. The mayor said the Chinese company that has expertise in designing, planning, manufacturing and construction has agreed to bear all the costs for conducting the studies and preparing the plan within three years of signing the MoU. According to the MoU, the Chinese company would complete the master plan focusing on the eight schemes and then identify and propose priority projects. The company would also finance implementa-tion of the prioritised projects as a priority partner. In exchange, the city corporation would provide the Chinese company with relevant data, documents, coordinate them with relevant Bangladesh government agencies and allocate a dedicated office, guest rooms and vehicles. Protection of the Padma river's left bank and reclaiming the river's char land topped the list of eight schemes in the MoU. Other schemes include setting up a specialised hospital, creation of an eco-park and a science city, and expansion of Shah Makhdum Airport.    "

      "text": "A drought-like prevailing for the last couple of weeks hits Aman paddy farming in different areas. In many places of Gaibandha, cracks developed in the dried up crop fields and many farmers, especially poor and marginal ones, could not transplant seedlings as they cannot afford the irrigation cost, reports our correspondent. High prices of Aman seedlings is also discouraging many farmers to cultivate Aman while growth of freshly transplanted seedlings is hampered due to lack of water. Solvent farmers are using own power pumps to irrigate Aman fields, but others have to pay Tk 100 to 150 per hour for irrigation, which adds to the production cost. \"I planted pricey Aman seedlings on five bighas of land, for which I had to borrow money from different sources. Now I have to count additional cost for irrigation to save the seedlings but water in field dries quickly due to scorching heat of the sun,\" said Wahedul Islam of Sonaidanga village in Gobindaganj upazila. Sirajul, another farmer of the same village, said he cultivated Aman on three bighas of land after buying seedlings at a high price. \"Due to the high cost of Aman cultivation that includes irrigation, I have kept two bighas of land unused. It will be difficult to recover the production cost of Aman.\" Many poor farmers in seven upazilas of the district have already given up hope for Aman cultivation this season. SM Ferdous, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) in Gaibandha, said, \"The last flood damaged seedbeds on 2,881 hectares of land and transplanted Aman seedlings on 7,520 hectares of land. And so, it is difficult to achieve the target of cultivation on 1.23 lakh and 68 hectares of land.\" The department has started distribution of Aman seedlings among the flood-hit farmers free of cost for one bigha each to increase areas of Aman cultivation this season, he added. Our Bagerhat Correspondent reports: Aman farming in Narail faces a setback due to lack of inadequate rainfall this season.  This year farmers in the district have cultivated Aman on 37,260 hectares of land against the official target of 37,010 hectares, said sources at the DAE. During a recent visit to Chasra Dakkhin Para of Narail Sadar upazila, this correspondent saw cracks in dried up Aman fields while many farmers are planting seedlings with irrigation from shallow pumps. \"I have cultivated Aman on 10 bighas of land. Like me, many farmers prepared their lands for cultivation with water drawn by shallow or deep power pump. I will have to spend at least Tk 15,000 for per bigha of land till the harvest as irrigation adds to the cost,\" said Ali Haider Litu, 45, a farmer of Chasra Dakkhin Para. \"Many others, mostly marginal farmers and sharecroppers, are still waiting for rainwater. It would be helpful if the government provides shallow machines and pipes for the farmers,\" said Ali, also president of 130 farmer groups in Narail Sadar upazila. Each group comprising 30 members is called Common Interest Group (CIG). Raju Ahmed of the area said, \"I have cultivated Aman on about two bighas of land after reaping jute in Bangla month of Bhadra. But this year the production cost will increase as we did not get enough rain. It would be helpful if we get at least a shallow machine and pipe for every group.\" Chinmoy Roy, deputy director of Narail DAE, said, \"This year our target of Aman cultivation area has exceeded but lack of rain hits the farm ers. The ministry concerned has taken a Tk 1000-crore mega project for buying agricultural machinery including power pumps for farmers across the country. We will distribute the items for a token money to 130 CIG units of farmers.\""

      "text": "The US wants to sign two defence agreements with Bangladesh as the latter is seeking to buy advanced equipment from the US as part of its goal to modernise the military by 2030. The agreements are General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) and the Acquisition Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA).  US officials termed them \"foundational agreements\" meant to strengthen defence relationship between two countries. The move comes as Bangladesh last year sought to buy advanced military equipment, said US officials during a media briefing in the city yesterday.  \"We are currently working with the government of Bangladesh to conclude certain foundational defence agreements ... these are essential to enabling a close relationship, expanding opportunities for defence trade, information sharing, and military-to-military cooperation between our two countries,\" said a US official wishing not to be named.  According to the official, GSOMIA is a foundational government-to-government agreement that permits greater collaboration.  \"It's a reciprocal legally-binding agreement that ensures governments understand and commit to protecting classified military information,\" said an official.   The GSOMIA does not obligate governments to share classified information or material. It ensures protection of the information shared by partner governments, the official said. The US has GSOMIA agreements with 76 countries, including some countries in South Asia.  \"As our relationship continues to grow with Bangladesh, GSOMIA is essential to enabling the cooperation we both seek,\" the official added.  For foreign military sales or GSOMIA, US security authorities will work closely with Bangladesh's security authorities to develop a plan and standard operating procedure to implement required measures for making sure classified information will be protected in Bangladesh. \"It's two way. We also commit the same kind of protection of Bangladesh's military information.\" Explaining the ACSA agreement, a US official said its purpose was to allow US and partner nations' forces procure and pay for common types of supplies and services.  It could cover everything from food, water, clothing, transportation, training, petroleum, ammunition, maintenance to medical services.  For example, the US official said, if a US ship arrived at Chattogram and needed fuel, it could buy it from Bangladesh government and pay in cash. The US ship could also pay through similar amount in fuel to a Bangladeshi ship in other parts of the world. \"Its purpose is to make it easy for our militaries to have better cooperation. ... It's to make things easy,\" the official said. It could facilitate transfer of fuel from Bangladesh military to visiting US ship participating in annual exercise. It could also improve US's ability to respond to any potential humanitarian or natural disaster and facilitate the transfer of fuel from US military to Bangladeshi naval ships outside normal geographical area, an official added.  \"The agreement does not in anyway commit a partner nation to military action nor does it authorise stationing of ships, aircraft or military personnel in foreign countries. It only serves to simplify procurement agreement, logistic support, supplies, and services between partner forces,\" the official added.  For practical purposes, the US has ACSA agreement with over a hundred countries throughout the globe, including India and Sri Lanka.  Asked if the defence agreements were meant to promote Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) or counter China, the US official said it was not about IPS or countering China and that they were trying to respond to the requests from Bangladesh. US and Bangladesh have military cooperation, including that for training of Bangladeshi peacekeepers, counter-terrorism exercises, disaster response, and exchange of trainings.  Last year, the US provided $5.3 million to cover the total cost of procurement and delivery of five Metal Shark boats to support the maritime security objectives of Bangladesh Navy.   The US also provided $3.3 million last year to send 233 members of the Bangladesh military to attend various military professionalisation courses within the US and the wider Indo-Pacific region, another US official said. \"We desire to support the Bangladesh Military Forces Goal 2030, as Bangladesh seeks to modernise its military equipment.\""

Reflecting on his advice against women's education, Fakhrul said such comments are unwanted, unwelcome and regrettable. \"I am stunned and surprised at Hefajat-e-Islam Chief Allama Shafi's comment,\" said the BNP leader in a press statement issued to the media. On Friday, Allama Shafi at parogramme in Chattogram urged parents not to educate their daughters beyond the fourth or fifth grade. Reflecting on it, Fakhrul said, Bangladeshi people will be embarrassed before the international community with such remarks. \"Women education is an indispensable matter to eradicate social misdeeds and disparities.\" Claiming that women education is a must, he said: \"Our country and society will stay in far behind from the growing trend of progress if our women are not educated.\""

      "text": "Feroz, 13, leaves Habib from time to time in his makeshift wheelchair outside the High Court Mazar gate and disappears into the distance. The young boy was hired seven days ago to wheel around Habib -- who earns his living by begging. In return for the service, Habib has promised Feroz free food and enough money in a year to build a hut for his family. Feroz speaks only once but his words highlight how he feels about the arrangement. \"I am here for one year.... Not even a day more,\" he says. Habib, who hails from Patuakhali, was born with a congenital disability in the legs and hands. He resorted to begging after finding nothing else to do. Over the years, he has hired many like Feroz to accompany him. The deal between Habib and the child's family seems to be benefiting both the sides, save the fact that it is depriving Feroz of all the rights a child is entitled to. The 55-year-old Habib too has no choice. While the country has been experiencing a remarkable economic shift over the last decade -- with the economy growing at a record-high pace of 8.13 percent in the fiscal year to July 2019 -- prosperity has yet to reach people like Feroz and Habib. Although there are laws in place for people in need, those are only on paper. The Hawker and the Disadvantaged (Rehabilitation) Act 2011 provides for detention of vagrants at government or private shelter homes for a maximum of two years and creating employment or source of income through skill development before release. A detainee can also be handed over to his relatives or any socially well-known person willing to take the responsibility. The laws were also not the first step. In 2010, the government mulled banning begging and making it a punishable offence but backtracked after the move was considered a human rights violation. Afterwards, they turned their focus towards rehabilitation. But going by the scores of beggars visible all over the country, it looks like neither the law nor the plans are being enforced properly. According to an estimate gathered by representatives under the Department of Social Services (DSS) last year, the city had about 22,000 beggars, or 10 percent of all beggars across the country. GOVT REHABILITATION PROGRAMME  With the promise of an inclusive growth, the government in 2010 launched a programme on rehabilitation and alternative employment under the DSS of the social welfare ministry for rehabilitation and alternative employment for people engaged in begging. Almost a decade later, little progress has been made. Until 2015, the programme for rehabilitation and alternative employment for the people engaged in begging was limited to conducting surveys and a pilot project, which rehabilitated 37 people in Mymensingh and 29 in Jamalpur. Ten NGOs were engaged in making lists of beggars across Dhaka back in 2010, but according to those involved the surveys were not completed properly. Since 2010, about Tk 24 crore has been allocated for the programme in yearly budgets, with 80 percent of the funds left unused. Shah Jahan, who joined as head of the programme last year, could not explain why this was so. Earlier, according to Shah Jahan, the rehabilitation programme was Dhaka-focused.  But DSS data shows that no rehabilitation work has been done in the capital. As more people poured into the capital in migrations triggered by climate change, and social and financial shocks, the government realised it had to support poor people in their areas to prevent them from coming to cities and beg. The idea was to create employment for the vulnerable people in the areas they were in, so as to prevent the migration. In fiscal 2017-18, the government rehabilitated 2,710 people in 58 districts at a cost of Tk 3 crore. The number, however, was not even a drop in the ocean. A 2017 Unicef data puts the yearly influx of urban migrants at five to seven lakh people. Last year, deputy commissioners and district-level officers of the DSS were asked to estimate expenditure for rehabilitating beggars in their areas. They came up with a figure of over 2 lakh beggars and rehabilitation cost of Tk 422 crore. Meanwhile, as part of the Dhaka city corporations' efforts to show the beggar menace is being dealt with, it declared places such as diplomatic zones, VIP areas and luxury hotels as \"beggar-free\". Some 212 \"professional beggars\" have so far been detained from such zones in the city during drives by mobile courts, according to the DSS. Driving beggars out of some areas in the capital that the government considers its \"drawing room\" is not a solution, says Debasish Kundu, of Dhaka University's sociology department. Their socio-economic condition and geographical areas where they are coming from should be analysed to prepare short-, mid- and long-term rehabilitation plan. Issues related to begging may vary from place to place. Noted economist Hossain Zillur Rahman says the problem has to be seen from the humanitarian perspectives. Employment should be generated under social safety net for this most disadvantaged group, not focusing on skills, rather on the financial need of them, he added.  A problem with focusing on skills and employment generation has been the absence of children from being part of any rehabilitation programme ALL CHILDREN LEFT BEHIND Asked about the support provided to children in this regard, Shah Jahan says there are six shelter homes run by the government for vagabonds, where children stay until their families are traced. During anti-vagrancy drives, police detain them and then place them before court that sends them to shelter homes. After handing them over to their families, guardians or relatives, there is no follow-up to ensure that they get proper care and don't return to the streets. \"It [follow-up] is not possible,\" Shah Jahan says.  Forhad Hossain, executive director of LEEDO (Local Education and Economic Development Organisation), says it rescued about 2,000 children from the streets over the last four years. Most of them were between 5 and 12 and had left home to escape abuse or an environment where they were uncared for, resulting from separation between parents. Some of them were abandoned.  Around 700 of them were reintegrated into their families. Others were sent to shelter homes run by the government and NGOs. Fifty-two children were accommodated in the LEEDO Peace Home. A comprehensive, holistic approach is needed for rehabilitating child beggars, Forhad says. If they are rescued within days after they get separated from home, it is easy to get them off the streets and discipline them. \"But when they live on the streets for quite long, they get used to that life even if they have to beg, work under local thugs.\"  LEEDO runs open schools at Sadarghat launch terminals to connect with street children. Social workers working there have noticed that children get sucked into thuggish cartels who offer them food and money. With time, unscrupulous people gain their trust and engage them in begging and other exploitative environment.    The 2011 Disadvantaged Act and the Prevention and Suppression of Human Trafficking Act 2012 define engaging someone in begging as punishable offence. Asked if anyone has been punished for engaging children or adults in begging, Shah Jahan, director of the government programme on rehabilitation and alternative employment for the people engaged in begging, says there were several instances pointing to commissioning of beggars but mobile courts could never find information in this regard. A PROMISING SOLUTION When the state is still working out how best it can wipe out begging menace across the country, Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation (PKSF), a financial institution founded by the government to support rural development, set an example of success. A programme launched in 2013 has rehabilitated 1,032 beggars prioritising elderly people with disabilities.      Each beneficiary got Tk 1 lakh. The programme is implemented in partnership with 116 organisations that help spend the money in training, building homes and creating opportunities for self-employment -- for example by setting up a stall, giving a rickshaw or livestock to rear.  \"PKSF is working in a limited number of areas...the government can take lessons from our programme and can launch similar interventions in a focused way all over the country,\" Jashim Uddin, deputy managing director of the PKSF, said in an e-mailed response. A similar initiative in Narail district also showed promise. The district social services office in 2015 sought advice from people of all professions to rehabilitate beggars following surveys that estimated the vagrants' number to be 800. The fund was created accumulating money from government allocation, one-day pay from all government and non-government employees and donations from elites, civil society members and businessmen. A beggars' rehabilitation association was also formed to help sustain the programme. Each beneficiary is closely monitored by one person to support him in situations of need, said Ratan Kumar Haldar, deputy director of the social services office. His office also contacted relatives of those who could not work and provided them with means to income to support back the beneficiaries.  Until more such programmes are initiated, not much progress can be expected. Back in Mazhar gate, Feroz is compelled to accompany Habib, who has to fund his two sons' education apart from making ends meet. Habib says he earns Tk 15,000 a month and lives with his family in Chankharpool in a rented house for Tk 7,000. \"I am all good with the blessings of Allah,\" he says, adding that Feroz's family is very poor and were living in the remotest part of Barisal. So, when and if Feroz goes back, his family will have money to buy tin sheets for a roof overhead.   "

      "text": "The capital's slum dwellers with access to official water supply consume 3.5 times less water than that of the affluent people though they all pay the same price, found a study of Brac Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD). Slum dwellers and other informal settlers pay at least seven times higher for inadequate water than the official rate of Tk 11 per thousand litres, said Mohammad Sirajul Islam, head of BIGD's state of cities programme, while presenting the study findings at Brac Centre yesterday. Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Wasa) provides water to 6.5 lakhs or at best 16 percent of the city's informal settlements, he said citing the study on water governance in the capital. While the affluent living in areas like Gulshan and Banani consume an average of 310-litre water per person daily, a slum dweller uses an average of 85 litres. The standard requirement is 150 litres per person, Sirajul Islam said. Based on affordability, per capita water consumption increases with higher income far beyond standard actual need. It means, there is a serious concern of inefficient water consumption and waste, thanks to inadequate water governance, he added. That apart, 10 families in a building with a common water meter, for example, pay equal share though all the families do not consume the same amount. It also leads to waste of water, as there is no reward for saving water, said Sirajul Islam. Despite the ever-depleting groundwater table in Dhaka and pollution of surface water sources, Wasa still depends on mining groundwater (78 percent) and the rest on purified surface water for its total daily production. Though Wasa has undertaken three capital-intensive surface water treatment projects since 2010, it has simultaneously increased installing deep tube wells by 38 percent. So, safe water management in Dhaka is in a deplorable state with highly inefficient water consumption, excessive dependence on groundwater and fast disappearing retention areas, found the study. The Detailed Area Plan of Dhaka in 2010 identified 5,523 acres of conservable water retention areas that came down to 1,744 acres in 2017, according to a Rajuk finding, the study cited. The study recommended household water management with individual metered water connection for rational consumption, harvesting rainwater, reusing water and putting an end to contaminating available river water. Dhaka Wasa Managing Director Taqsem A Khan said according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, there are one million slum dwellers in the capital. But, Taqsem said, the figure is double according to Centre for Urban Studies, and they officially provide half of them with safe water. By 2021, Wasa aims at shifting two-third dependency on surface water, he said, adding that it is not easy to make water service a success with the exact number of population in the capital unknown. He said ground percolation in Dhaka is almost at a halt with flood flow zones and retention areas filled up. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, said there is no credible information on the status of Dhaka's groundwater. She demanded that the Wasa MD disclose all proposed water projects for public debate. Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives Minister Md Tazul Islam, among others, spoke while BIGD Executive Director Imran Matin conducted the discussion on the study findings.  "

      "text": "Bangladesh was the third highest recipient of loans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) last year, in further testament to the development partners' enhanced opinion of the country.\n\tOf the $21.58 billion pledged by the Manila-based multilateral lender, $2.20 billion went to Bangladesh, dwarfed only by the amounts received by India ($3.52 billion) and China ($2.62 billion), the two largest economies of the region.\n\tThe amount is the highest yet for Bangladesh from the ADB, which typically commits in the neighbourhood of $1.5 billion every year, according to a presentation during its 52nd annual meeting, which wrapped up yesterday.\n\tIn 2017 Pakistan was the third highest recipient of the ADB's loans at $2.10 billion, but last year it dropped to $1.08 billion.\n\tThe ADB also arranges co-financing with other bilateral or multilateral development partners and in 2018 it arranged $35.81 billion for the Asia-Pacific nations, of which $4.48 billion went to Bangladesh -- the highest.\n\t\"If an economy is growing at 7-8 percent the whole world will come and invest,\" said Hun Kim, ADB's director general for South Asia operations.\n\tSo, funding will never be an impediment to Bangladesh's growth ambitions, he said, adding that the ADB was willing to lend more provided the country was able to utilise it nimbly, effectively and with tangible end products.\n\tThe ADB offers mainly two kinds of loans. One of them carries concessional interest rate of about 2 percent and is of 25 years' tenure with a five-year grace period. The other is at competitive rates connected to the LIBOR.\n\tBetween 2019 and 2021, the bank is planning to lend $8.1 billion, which is 65.31 percent more than in the previous three years.\n\tAbout two-thirds of the 2019-2021 lending programme focuses on developing and improving infrastructure, according to the ADB's internal documents.\n\tPriority infrastructure support will go towards expanding power generation capacity, improving power transmission and distribution networks, supporting regional power interconnections, strengthening road, railway, and port connectivity; and improving urban infrastructure and services, water supply and sanitation. \n\tThe programme will also pay attention to ensuring high-quality education and skills development with a renewed focus on science, technology and innovation; developing economic corridors and improving rural market connectivity and agribusiness infrastructure and flood and riverbank erosion management.\n\t\"Your capacity to implement mega projects or many projects is growing but that will be the main bottleneck. Money will never be a bottleneck,\" Kim said.\n\tLengthy internal business processes often delay project approvals, while the limited capacity of the country's few executing and implementing agencies often leads to delays in project implementation, said the ADB documents.\n\tIn 2018, the ADB conducted special initiatives to help strengthen the implementation capacity of the government, finance project preparatory works to improve project readiness and enhance technical design covering environment, land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. \n\tThe ADB's new procurement policy and regulations, rolled out and operationalised in 2017, are helping ensure faster procurement and consultant recruitment as well as simpler and more effective fiduciary systems throughout the project cycle, the documents said.\n\tThe ADB has been a development partner of Bangladesh since 1973, and established its first field office in Dhaka in 1982. Since 1973, the ADB has committed a total of $22.9 billion and financed 282 projects in the country.\n\tEstablished in 1966, the ADB is owned by 68 members, 49 of which are from the region.  "

      "authors": null,
      "text": "Star Showbiz: 'Joler Gaan' has now touched the milestone of 12 glorious years. How do you evaluate the journey so far? Rahul Ananda: The name Joler Gaan came to be established on the year 2006, but my relation with Kanak Aditya goes even further back to the days when we studied together in Charukola. We both shared the similar passions for music and musical instruments. So it is sort of a 'musical-friendship', that we fostered amongst ourselves. We would express ourselves to each other through our songs, sitting in Charukola's bakultola, balcony, playing on  fields and where not! We would make the tables our percussions, and sing our hearts open, all day and all night. The two of us had a dream of making our own musical band. That is how Joler Gaan was born. I came up with the name.   Showbiz: Did you have any specific reason for choosing the name? Rahul: We were introduced to an organizer from the Edinburgh Festival back in the days of our singing together in Charukola. Later we received an invitation from him via email. He mentioned we would require a title for our troupe in order to follow the invitation. But we said we did not yet have one. It was then we also felt the need to have a title. Since we belong to a land of rivers, we reckoned our name shall also carry the impression. The water here is diverse, and hence we are Joler Gaan. Our fetus develops within the water of mother's womb, and hence we are Joler Gaan. Water accumulates the shape of its carrier, and hence we are Joler Gaan. Water has a wide range of names and forms; it is in seas, rivers, ponds, clouds, rains... it has such a vast diversity! We love the amazing diversity, and hence - Joler Gaan!   Showbiz: Have you written the major portion of 'Joler Gaan''s songs? Rahul: To this date, yes. Shawon Akhand has also contributed significantly. He used to write most of the songs in our primary days. Our beloved friend Sanjeeb, who unfortunately has passed away too early, wrote a couple of our songs.   Showbiz: Your songs yield the aura of our nature and our natives. Was it a part of your initial plan while forming the band? Rahul: Our innate affection for mother nature may have reflected on to the totality. Perhaps our root in Charukola is also a reason behind that. The course in Charukola naturally constructs a bridge between the cosmos and the innocence of minds. Only those who can see with the mind's eyes, come to Charukola. We wanted to play with harmony the way we played with colors and brushes. When I initiated Joler Gaan with my friend Kanak, we were certain that whether or not we succeed, our goal would be to portray the landscape of Bangladesh through our songs. I would often go to Baul Akhras with my friend Shawon, reside there, and learn from their lifestyles. I can doubtlessly say that my love for my land and my people is genuine.   Showbiz: How do you view band music in general? Rahul: When one person sings, we call it solo; when two does, we call it duet and when there are three, we name it trio. But after that, we do not have any tag anymore, and so we call it a band. But this cannot be an ideal description. We have seen band-parties playing as a part of our festivities. We have seen group of bauls performing together as well. Those who did palagaans also had different sorts of teams and troupes.  So what would be our reason for not calling them bands, too? We have to have a clear conception of the term before everything. Then we can discuss the rest.   Showbiz: What is your philosophy regarding music? Rahul: My years of studying in Charukola and working in the theaters have enabled me to realize that music is a path through which we attempt to discover our lives in this universe. We seek to find the divine, the unknown through whatever is known. We wish to touch what is beyond our reach through the harmony. Songs are only a part of the supreme quintessence of music.

      "authors": "\nUNB, Dhaka\n",
      "text": "Terming the dengue outbreak a big problem, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday urged the people of the country to remain aware about the mosquito-borne disease and keep their houses and surroundings clean to check the breeding of aedes mosquitoes. \"The dengue prevalence is still there...it used to be believed that these elite aedes mosquitoes are seen in posh areas... now they've spread elsewhere ...to many districts. So, we'll have to remain more alert about it,\" she added. Sheikh Hasina said this while exchanging Eid greetings with officials at the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). Dengue is not only seen in Bangladesh, but also in many neighbouring countries in South Asia and even South East Asia, the prime minister said. In other countries like the Philippines, it has turned epidemic forcing them to declare emergency, Hasina added. The prime minister extended thanks to her office as it has always been active over the dengue issue. She said the Health Ministry, the Local Government Ministry and all other agencies concerned remain active to deal the dengue problem. The city corporations have also been trying to rein in the dengue, Hasina said adding that all the authorities concerned have taken proper measures to deal with the problem. About the country's economic progress, the prime minister said the GDP growth reached 8.10 percent and the government has fixed a target in the national budget for the current fiscal year to achieve an 8.2 percent growth. The government has a target to reach the double digit, she added. Mentioning that it is tough to accelerate the GDP growth from 8 percent, Hasina directed the government officials to work harder to do that. The prime minister stressed the need for the revival of some pro-people programmes like 'Ghore Phera Project', 'Shanti Nibash Project' and 'Oboshor Project' introduced by her previous governments. \"We had taken these schemes for the welfare of people. But their tenures have expired. So, we'll have to re-launch the projects in the interest of people,\" she said. While talking about her government's steps for curbing corruption, the prime minister said those who take and give bribe both are equally guilty. \"We could have accomplished many works faster if steps had been taken keeping that in mind.\" She asked her office to strengthen its monitoring so that the physical works on development projects can be started right after the recession of floodwater. \"Since we've a good set-up, I think our office will have to strengthen the monitoring so that every ministry can prioritise works holding meetings right now.... and we can start the physical works (on the development projects taken for this fiscal year) immediately after the flood,\" she said. She said the Prime Minister's Office should give a special attention to taking preparations so that the projects can be implemented timely. Noting that the government has undertaken various development projects in the current budget, Hasina said different ministries should now prioritise works as per the development projects keeping it in mind that they get time to take preparations during flood. The prime minister said the country witnesses flood every year right after the national budget is placed. \"So, paper works on the development projects can be completed during the period of flood.\" Prime Minister's advisers HT Imam, Dr Mashiur Rahman and Dr Tawfique-E-Elahi Chowdhury, Principal Coordinator on SDG Affairs at PMO Md Abul Kalam Azad, PM's Press Secretary Ihasanul Karim, PMO Secretary Md Sajjadul Hassan and PM's Speech Writer M Nazrul Islam were, among others, present at the function moderated by PM's Principal Secretary Md Nojibur Rahman."

      "text": "It is indeed a seminal event in the history of Bangladesh that the UN last year declared Bangladesh eligible to step up to a developing economy from being a Least Developed Country (LDC). Of course the process is gradual and due to take effect in 2024 with a grace period of three years to wean off the special dispensations of the LDC status. The graduation process has been in the works for at least a couple of decades as the country steadied its economic direction and dug in deep with its market economy orientation since the early nineties. The consistent five-percent-plus economic growth over the last three decades combined with booming apparel exports and incremental development and strengthening of economic institutions such as Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission, Bangladesh Investment Development Authority, Competition Commission, Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection, and others have paved the way for Bangladesh to march ahead to the top of LDCs and steadily distance itself from other LDCs in terms of economic performance. That Bangladesh would be classified as a middle-income country ridding itself of the stigma of being at the bottom of the economic performance band known as the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in course of time was inevitable. In fact, when Bangladesh was first grouped under the LDC category in the mid-seventies, it actually did not meet one of the principal criteria of being a LDC: its population size was much above the threshold set for LDCs. It is claimed by the cognoscenti that Bangladesh's inclusion was engineered by an eminent economist of the soil who happened to be working for the UN at the time. The LDC classification is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it accords us duty-free access to the richer economies of the world, concessional credits from the multilateral development institutions such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and others, exemption from intellectual property rights enforcements for the time being and other economic benefits. There are numerous examples where a locally conceived development project worth a few crore taka taken over by such a development partner bloats in size to more than several hundred crores and ends up with a top-heavy project with no local inputs and gets shuttered as soon as the project ends.  On the other hand, the classification brings with it the dark stigma of the \"Least Developed\" label which subconsciously carries with it all sorts of denigrating ramifications that any citizen of the country travelling with the green passport around the world can attest to. Aside from inconveniences as a world traveller, the commercial implications of being a LDC are manifold. In trade negotiations there is this \"hand-me-down\" attitude making it difficult to trade as equals leading to lowest value addition in most of our exports; while-collar service exports are not taken seriously by potential overseas buyers who identify the country as a source of cheap unskilled labour, hardly the place to buy professional services from; the LDC classification combined with our large population size made us the favourite punching bag of the international media when it comes to lack of civic amenities or sufferings from natural calamities. Based on pure number of flooding incidents, Bangladesh would not even rank in the top 10 most flood-prone countries of the world but the scenes of flooding and destitute street beggars in Bangladesh making the rounds of BBC and CNN have created an impression that all of Bangladesh is submerged under water most of the year. I recall meeting the chief executive of a billion-dollar corporation in the US in the nineties who asked me in all seriousness whether I owned a boat as he thought that's the only way people in Bangladesh can move around. I was so aghast that I told him I did not but then again we really learn to swim very early! It took him several long seconds to realise the pun. But at the end of the day, when your trading partners take you as a \"Least Developed\" hand-to-mouth survivor at the bottom of the economic pyramid, it is not a lot of fun to make deals. And deals are what make businesses thrive and businesses are what create wealth for the nation, and the more wealth the nation makes, the higher it moves up the economic performance scale. So the bottom line is that while the LDC status gave us a concessional window into global markets and credits, it also held us back as if in a straitjacket of negative perceptions, making it extremely difficult for our businesses to move up the value chain and contribute more to the economic might of the nation. On a per-capita income basis, Bangladesh has crossed the lower band of the middle-income status as defined by the World Bank last year. Bangladesh has to maintain or exceed several other economic and social indicators over the next five years to be formally stripped of the LDC moniker. Aside from an economic and governance disaster happening in the intervening period, nothing can deter Bangladesh's graduation to middle-income status in 2024. Several other LDC countries are also en route to similar status change by then. The ICT policy adopted by the government in 2009 set the achievement goals based on economic development enabled by ICT and predicted graduation to middle-income country by 2021 and a developed economy by 2041. It is heartening to see the government aligning its overall development strategy in sync with the proclamations of the ICT Policy 2009 which was drafted by a working group headed by this author under the overall guidance of National Professor Jamilur Reza Choudhury in 2008. The impact of the loss of LDC privileges has been softened by a three-year grace period from 2024 to 2027, during which time the country must prepare itself, if not done already, to negotiate bilateral trade protocols with our major trading partners; carry out institutional strengthening of the World Trade Organization Directorate in partnership with the major national trade associations; and enhance productivity of both manufacturing and services industries to face off global competition. The threat of intellectual property rights enforcement is another major concern that will have to be concertedly addressed by the pharmaceutical and software industries, among others, but the gradual benefits of local IPR will outweigh the impact of overseas IPR costs. At the receiving end of being an LDC are the prescriptive charity packages from multilateral development partners such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and others. These funding agencies provide both outright grants and concessional loans that come with strings attached such as imposition of institutional reforms and development projects put together by international consultants that are detached from the ground realities and that most often turn out to be very expensive for the country. There are numerous examples where a locally conceived development project worth a few crore taka taken over by such a development partner bloats in size to more than several hundred crores and ends up with a top-heavy project with no local inputs and gets shuttered as soon as the project ends. The nation is then left with a huge loan tab to repay over many years. Such project bloats are all too common when donor funds are involved. With LDC status removed, such concessional lending with donor-imposed unrealistic conditions should be gone and that cannot be fast enough. Graduating from an LDC into a developing economy will see more higher-end exports as we move up the value chain. ICT services exports will get a huge boost as will professional services export. Developing economy also means that government employees will be better compensated and government services will become more professional and business-friendly. The big change will be perceptible lessening in corrupt practices whereby the informal economy will go down as a share of GDP, thus strengthening the economy further. LDC graduation is the beginning of a great march to economic emancipation of the nation as a whole. Let's all partake in it in realising a truly Shonar Bangla with no one left behind.

      "text": "Locals formed human chains in 10 upazilas of Sunamganj district yesterday morning demanding steps to protect Boro harvest of the haor region. \"Haor Bachao, Sunamganj Bachao Andolon\" organised the programme. They demanded forming Project Implementation Committees (PIC) after public hearing, prompt construction of Haor protection embankments and stopping the construction of unnecessary embankments. As per the policy, all works related to the embankments must start by December 15 and have to be finished by February 28. But the work is yet to start in full swing as it was delayed because of the parliamentary elections on December 30. Although the administration is hopeful of finishing the reconstruction on time, farmers and rights activists are worried about the quality of the work. In March-April of 2017, flash floods hit the district and other haor areas of north-east region, and the whole Boro cultivation was washed away. Following corruption related to the construction of the embankment, the ministry filed cases and had to revise its policy related to reconstruction. According to the revised Kajer Binimoye Taka (Kabita) Policy of 2017 of Water Development Board (WDB), all works related to the embankments must start by December 15 and have to be finished by February 28 every year. As per the policy, the administration will form Project Implementation Committees (PIC) headed by the upazila nirbahi officers (UNO) by November 30 every year. The PICs are responsible for the reconstruction work of embankments. The policy also determines that all schemes must be submitted to WBD by the district committee before September every year. The district committee is formed with the deputy commissioner as president and WDB executive engineer as member secretary. Sunamganj WDB Executive Engineer Abu Bakar Siddique Bhuiyan said they planned to form 553 PICs to reconstruct 553 projects in 37 haors of 11 upazilas in the district this year. \"The total work will cost Tk 94 crore and the ministry concerned has already sanctioned one-fourth of the amount to start the work. Till last Monday, 243 PICs had been formed and only seven of them have started working, but the work will start in full swing soon,\" he said. \"The work was delayed due to the national election, but we are hopeful of finishing it in time,\" said the executive engineer, also member secretary of the district committee for embankment construction. This year, 450 kilometres of embankments are being reconstructed by the WDB, while it was 1,300 kilometres last year. No flash flood hit the Boro cultivation last year. Abdul Hakim, a farmer of Jamalganj upazila in Sunamganj, said Boro cultivation is going on in full swing although the embankment work has not started yet, which is worrying the farmers. \"All embankments need time to be strong enough to protect farms from flash flood, but if the work is finished in a hurry, then it will be of poor quality,\" said Kasmir Reza, president of Paribesh O Haor Unnayan Sangstha. \"We should remember the situation the country faced due to the flash flood of 2017 that washed away the Boro crop totally. We will submit a memorandum to the administration soon with the demand for quality work in time,\" he said. Boro is being cultivated on 217,600 hectares of land in the district this year as the weather is favourable, said Bashir Ahmed Sarkar, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture Extension in Sunamganj. The farmers are afraid of occurrence of flash flood as the work is being delayed, he said. Deputy Commissioner of Sunamganj Abdul Ahad said, \"Hopefully the work will be finished in time. As the method of working is machine-based now, the quality of work will be ensured before the finishing.\"c"

      "headline": "\"The space for in-depth critical journalism is shrinking\"",
      "authors": null,
      "text": "Why do you think independent publications like Himal Southasian are important in today's media landscape?  I think independent media organisations are even more important today than ever before because most of mainstream media has almost completely ceded the space for journalism with a public purpose. Some years ago, we (Himal) published a volume called Growing Media, Shrinking Spaces and the title was deliberate. Despite the proliferation of media in our region, the space for in-depth critical journalism is shrinking, especially in mainstream media. While battles over censorship have been fought and won by many of these organisations, this new battle is being lost without a shot being fired because it is a battle of journalism against the commercialisation of media houses. Big media is subsidised by or has become vehicles for advertising revenue, and this in turn requires feel-good journalism. While critical articles are thrown in here and there as a sprinkling of credibility, really incisive journalism, the bigger questions of growing inequity and injustice are largely left unasked because such journalism does not go hand in hand with encouragement of rampant consumption which in turn drives the advertising revenue and the profit motive. Tell us about the way Himal functions and is funded. How do you manage to survive at a time when even big media outlets are struggling financially and are having to slash their supplements and magazines?  Himal has always depended almost entirely on donor funding to subsidise its operations. Its model of cross-border, in-depth, public interest journalism was pioneering and received generous support from international donors for decades. However, that has changed in recent years and while we continue to receive support--currently from Open Society Foundations--it is becoming more of a struggle to secure donor funding. I must add here that despite the fact that \"beggars can't be choosers\", we beggars are quite choosy as well as careful about who we get funding from. We feel this is particularly important for a media organisation and this limits the pool of donors we are comfortable with. There are many compelling claims on donor resources--and the urgency of equally or more compelling claims keeps increasing as governments across the region are retreating from their obligations to their citizens. Journalism is not always seen as an urgent, immediate need. Moreover, most donors in the media sphere are looking for the Next New Thing and increasingly seeking the magic mantra for sustainability. They are, therefore, keen to fund more experimental ventures. There are few takers for survivors and that's what we are--we have stayed the course doggedly for over three decades. All of this makes it imperative that organisations like ours find ways to reduce donor dependency. Non-profit should not mean non-revenue. We have experimented with several forms over the decades--the monthly magazine subscription format, the bookazine subscription cum book sales model, and now the online-only version for which we intend to launch the membership model. Given the fact that a substantive part of Himal's readership is international, I think we have a really good chance of reducing our donor dependency in the short term and meeting most if not all our costs in the long term. But earning revenue requires a long runway of both time and investment and we have never had that. However, we intend to go as far as we can, for as long as we can, even with our limited resources. In the dire situation our region finds itself in today, there can be no excuses not to keep fighting for survival, even against the odds. To extend upon this subject, Himal Southasian was forced to cease its operations in November 2016. The way in which bureaucratic measures were used to curb your freedom of expression is a warning for those wanting to set up independent media outlets or find alternative revenue models. Could you talk about what happened back then and how you went about the re-launch? \n Governments everywhere are becoming more sophisticated. While the tools of censorship and overt attacks are still being used, new techniques are being minted which are simpler and yet more sophisticated. For example, investigations of some kind are initiated into an organisation. If this is to look into finances, no explanation or even smoking gun is required. Not only will the organisation find scant support--after all, who can vouch for another's financial probity?--but it is usually the process which kills, not the outcome. The investigative process can be dragged out and there are no consequences for the government even if the organisation is found blameless at the end. Moreover, many organisations pay scant attention to their admin and finance leaving them vulnerable, as loose ends can be used against them even where there is no malfeasance or intention of any wrongdoing. It is imperative that independent organisations, especially those critical of their governments, make sure their back-end is as impeccable as their work. However, this is not always as easy as it seems. Rule of law is weak in most regions and the discretionary power of governments enormous. In the case of Himal, even though we had put in a lot of effort to ensure that we had strong transparent systems in place, we were shut down by bureaucratic strangulation. In our case, there was no investigation, no charge, and not even a single question about our financial and administrative processes. The government authorities simply withheld permissions on a host of issues until we were forced to close. Files were \"held\" for over a year. Result: Himal closed down. Consequences to government: nil. Yet we are one of the lucky ones. Being a regional organisation, we looked to see where we could relocate. We found a warm welcome in Sri Lanka--and a number of civil society leaders willing to become board members and offer practical advice on setting up a non-profit here. And though we felt it was unfair that our probity had not helped us survive in Kathmandu, that probity was necessary for us to relocate and set up here in Colombo. I am quite convinced that Southasian solidarity is the only way forward as most of our region moves towards greater authoritarianism and increasing restrictions. Has digitisation really democratised the media/can it even the playing field for independent media? Where do you think the challenges remain?  Digitisation is a tool and like any tool, its efficacy depends on how it is used. It has made it possible for organisations like us to continue publishing at a time when it has become harder to move hard copies across borders. It has allowed space for stories that could never be told earlier. However, we also see the tools of digitisation being used to spread xenophobia and hatred. We see the challenge of \"free\" internet preventing organisations from earning a revenue, we see the flood of infotainment submerge serious journalism, we see algorithms short circuit our efforts to expand our knowledge, and ever-increasing simplifications drown out journalism that seeks to map an increasingly complex world.  How we do \"regulate\" fake news and social media platforms like Facebook without censorship and curtailing the right to free speech? The comedian and actor Sacha Baron Cohen caused a stir recently when he said Facebook would have allowed Hitler to buy ads. I think there is a deep kernel of truth there that we are all missing. We have fought long and hard to make our print journalism more meaningful, we have paid the price for standing up to the onslaught of infotainment and against great challenges we have evolved standards, the red lines for what our newspapers will not advertise. Now in the name of new media, all those gains are being reversed. \"Anything goes\" seems to be the new mantra. We need to go back to the drawing board and remind ourselves of the standards that we evolved with great difficulty and move forward from there, not backward. In terms of fake news--we need to pay considerably more attention. While we cannot pursue and debunk all fake news, I think we need to name and shame fake news at least when it appears in mainstream media. That would be a beginning. We are far more comfortable rewarding good journalism but somehow shy away from calling out bad journalism. Why can't we, as journalists, be more openly critical of bad journalism the way we are critical of all other things? Do you think the longform will survive the attention span of millennials and Gen Z?  I actually think the time for longform is not past but yet to come and this is why: all of us have hundreds or thousands of articles we bookmark but never get around to reading; we read dozens of articles on the same subject and they often leave us none the wiser. Eventually we will want to cut through that volume and read incisive pieces--we will choose quality because we can't keep up with the quantity. We will look for articles that explain and increase our understanding instead of repeating what we have already read. That, precisely, will be long-form. Especially for many of us in small independent media, the question we need to ask is: Do we want to add to the flood of similar sounding articles, or can we even compete with larger organisations which have the capacity of producing large volumes? Or are we going to make a decisive move away from that and focus on creating something where we can actually bring value that other larger profit-oriented organisations cannot? Even if it is hard going in current times, that is where we need to be when the shift takes place."

      "text": " The swelling Padma has flooded vast areas of Rajshahi, Pabna and Chapainawabganj following onrush of water from the river's Indian upstream and incessant rain for the last couple of days. Our staff correspondent from Rajshahi reports: At least 15,692 people were affected by the flood in Paba, Godagari and Bagha upazilas, said officials at the district administration. Some 600 families were shifted to safe places in the city, at least 11 educational institutions in Bagha upazila were shut and crops on 102 hectares of land were damaged due to the flood, they said. In last one week, hundreds of people from low lying char areas took shelter at their relatives' houses and different slums in the city. \"The flood followed downpour in the upstream of the Padma, which triggered extra flow of water from Indian Bihar state. All gates of the Farakka Barrage in India remained open since beginning of the monsoon,\" said Mohammad Ali, chief engineer of Water Development Board's (WDB) Rajshahi zonal office. \"We are keeping watch on the water level, which was only 41 centimetres below the danger level this [Tuesday] afternoon. The river will continue to rise until the flood situation in India improves,\" said the official. Aminul Haque, district relief and rehabilitation officer, said they distributed 50 tonnes of food grain and 900 packets of dry food among the affected people. Visiting the Padma bank yesterday, this correspondent saw people from the char areas coming to Rajshahi city with their domestic animals and other belongings in boats. Sazedur Rahman, a boatman, said he has two homes - one in Rajshahi city, and the other at Char Khanpur where some 200 families like him live. Most of the families have shifted to the city as a large portion of the char went under water. \"Some 365 families of Char Khanpur and Madhya Char were affected. Most people have shifted to the city, but some are still staying on high lands,\" said Mofidul Islam Bachchu, chairman of Harian union parishad in Paba. Our Pabna Correspondent reports: The onrush of water from the upstream in the Padma caused flash floods in many low lying areas of Pabna Sadar, Ishwardi and Sujanagar upazilas in last 24 hours as the river is flowing above the danger level. \"The river was flowing two centimetre above the danger level at Hardinge Bridge point this [Tuesday] morning. The water level may increase next few days due to the onrush of water from the upstream and continuous rain,\" Johurul Haque, executive engineer of WDB, told the journalists after visiting the Padma. Hundreds of houses in Pabna Sadar, Ishwardi and Sujanagar upazilas went under water due to the sudden rise of water level in the Padma. \"The floodwater entered our houses and crop fields so rapidly that we could not save anything,\" said Md Belal Hossain of Char Sanikdiar village in Pabna Sadar upazila. Md Sirajul Islam, district relief and rehabilitation officer, said, \"The water level is increasing and district administration is prepared to take necessary steps. The recent rise of water level caused massive damaged to crops. We are collecting information of damage.\" Our Chapainawabganj Correspondent adds: The Padma was flowing 41 centimetres below the danger level at Pankha point of Shibganj upazila in Chapainawabganj yesterday morning, said Atikur Rahman, sub-divisional engineer of Chapainawabganj Water Development Board. A few villages in the low areas of Panka union in Shibganj upazila and Narayanpur union in Sadar upazila were flooded due to the rise in water, he said. The Padma enters Bangladesh from India through Pankha point of Shibganj."

      "text": "Idris Ali of Kurigram's Nageswari upazila is awaiting success in cultivating dates from Saudi Arabia.  Nine of his 84 trees have produced dates in his plantation this year, reports our Kurigram correspondent. Idris, 52, son of Shahor Ali of Kamarpara village under Nageswari municipality, is the second among his six siblings and had been educated up to primary level.  He is cultivating dates of four varieties from Saudi Arabia in 27 decimals of land in nearby Malbhanga village. Some date trees bore fruits cluster-wise that will be fit for consumption within two months.     Idris Ali said, \"My younger brother Eunus Ali, 38, who is working in Saudi Arabia, sent me some date saplings from there in 2014. The date plants are being cultivated here according to his advice. My father and brothers also take care of the trees. Every year each tree gives rise to some new plants from its base. As we plant those separately, some survive while some do not. In 2017, I planted around 500 saplings in another land, but all were damaged by flood.\" \"Later I expanded the plantation with 84 trees. For the first time this year, nine of 84 trees have so far produced 17 clusters of date fruit. I have kept the fruits covered with baskets, so that those are not damaged by hail or rain.  Usually, the trees from new saplings bear fruits about five years and produce new plants from second year after being planted,\" Idris said. \"I shall expand the date cultivation in the coming year as I am expecting a good yield this year. To see my date plantation, many curious people come here every day and express their interest to buy the date saplings,\" Idris said. \"I took advice of local agriculture official. According his advice, I planted saplings by preparing beds in the land. Sometimes I gave cow-dung, chicken litter, vermicompost fertiliser and chemical fertilisers such as TSP, MOP and urea in the soil, and also sometimes sprayed pesticides on the trees,\" he said. \"I secured Diploma in Electrical Engineering in 1999 and went to Saudi Arabia for a job in 2002. I have been working on electrical maintenance in a private company at Al-Jubail area under Dammam in Saudi Arabia,\" Eunus Ali, 38, said over phone. \"I watched an agriculture programme of Shaikh Siraj on Channel i on farmer Motaleb Hossain's date farming in Mymensingh's Bhaluka upazila in 2005 and was inspired for date cultivation in my home in Bangladesh. Then I observed how to plant date saplings and farming those in Dammam,\" Eunus said. \"At first I sent 15 date saplings to home in 2014 through a Bangladeshi expatriate while he returned home from Saudi Arabia. I sent the saplings in a packet. My elder brother Idris Ali received it from the airport,\" Eunus said. \"After he received those, I described him about the date cultivation process. He planted those according to my advice. I sent around 200 more saplings of four varieties of date in about ten times from Saudi Arabia. The varieties are Ajwa, Khelus, Helalee and Barhee. The costly variety is Ajwa, but the highest yield comes from the Helalee variety that gives fruits up to 500 kilogrammes per year,\" Eunus said. \"I advised my brothers to expand date cultivation in two acres of land. Already 16,000 date seeds have been sent to Bangladesh by parcel this year. We would begin to sell the saplings and seeds from 2022. After some years, I expect to sell date fruits worth at least Tk 1 crore per year,\" he added. \"I visited Idris' Saudi date plantation. Fruits have come to some trees and their growths are being found well.\" Nageswari Upazila Agricultural Officer Md Samsuzzaman said."

      "text": "Food Minister Sadhan Chandra Majumder yesterday asked all deputy commissioners to ensure that paddy is bought directly from farmers for meeting the government's rice procurement target. \"We set a target of buying four lakh tonnes of paddy from farmers in the current Boro season. So far, we have procured about 1.15 lakh tonnes. The deputy commissioners are helping with the process,\" he told reporters after joining a session on the third day of the DC conference in the capital. \"We asked them [DCs] to strengthen the paddy procurement process. Our officials will be more active. We asked them [DCs] to send the UNOs [Upazila Nirbahi Officers] to the field to expedite the process,\" said Sadhan. Currently, the Office of the Upazila Controller of Food purchases paddy from farmers at the upazila level, and the Office of the District Controller of Food procures paddy at the district level. The UNOs monitor the process in upazilas and the DCs in districts, said officials. Since 1991, the Directorate of Food bought only 15 percent of its total annual purchase of the staple in the form of paddy from growers while it procured the rest 85 percent in the form of rice from millers. As a result, millers have gained more from the government's food grain procurement policy, the number one objective of which is to provide price support to farmers. The minister's comments come at a time when farmers in many areas are getting prices much lower than their production costs. Frustrated by low prices, many farmers have threatened to stop growing rice. \"We don't have any food crisis now. We have enough stocks of food and relief. We are prepared to face any situation,\" Sadhan said in response to a query whether the current flood would create any food crisis in the country. When Shadan's attention was drawn to the DCs' proposal for setting up offices of the Food Safety Authority at district and divisional levels, he said the government would do that to intensify drives against food adulteration. He also said the government will build separate silos for storing paddy. Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment Minister Imran Ahmed said he sought assistance from the DCs to bring to book middlemen, who are alluring overseas jobseekers and putting them in danger abroad. \"These middlemen loot overseas jobseekers. They take Tk 7 lakh from each jobseeker while the cost of sending one abroad is Tk 1.50 lakh. Those who go abroad with middlemen's help become undocumented,\" he told reporters. When his attention was drawn to the DCs' proposal for providing smart cards to overseas jobseekers at the district level, he said, \"The government has already taken steps on this matter. We have a plan to provide these cards from the digital centres in the unions across the country.\" The cards contain all information furnished in jobseekers' passports, their fingerprints, and the names and licence numbers of the recruiting agencies, allowing the authorities to identify all the parties involved in the migration process. Prices of essentials like onion and garlic will come down within 15 days, Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi said after a session with the DCs. Rain and fall in onion import from India have resulted in a hike in its prices, he pointed out. He claimed that the government has been successful in keeping the prices of essentials in control. The minister asked the DCs to remain alert against food adulteration. Emerging from the session, Law Minister Anisul Huq said a proposal on salaries of public prosecutors (PPs) and additional PPs was sent to the finance ministry. At present, the PPs and APPs don't draw any monthly salary. They are paid on the basis of their attendance at court hearings. \"We have already instructed the superintendent of police in Cumilla to scale up security at court... Security at all courts across the country will be tightened,\" Anisul said replying to a query on security at courts following the murder of a man in front of a judge and policemen at a packed courtroom in Cumilla on Monday. About a deputy commissioner's proposal for giving DCs the authority to empower executive magistrates to deal with sections 98, 108, 110, 144, 145 and 147 of the CrPC, Anisul said it is not possible to consider the proposal right now. \"We will hold discussions to decide whether it is needed or not. The relevant law has to be amended for implementing such a proposal.\" The minister also said the government will set up a cell to expedite the process of disposing of cases pending with courts across the country. The cell comprising five or six deputy attorney generals will help maintain liaison between the Attorney General's Office and the DCs, he added. Textiles and Jute Minister Golam Dastagir Gazi claimed that an anti-government quarter is provoking the workers of state-run jute mills into waging a movement to create instability in the sector. \"Real workers don't want to wage a movement... but an anti-government quarter is instigating them.\" The minister said state-owned jute mills are struggling to compete with those in the private sector following the raise in wages of public jute mill workers in line with the recommendations of the National Wages and Productivity Commission 2015. The government has a plan to operate the state-run jute mills under Public-Private Partnership projects. \"We are also considering a Chinese proposal for financial assistance.\" The minister said he had asked the DCs to enforce the Mandatory Jute Packaging Act 2010 to protect the interests of the jute growers and mills. Meanwhile, Justice Muhammad Imman Ali, who is currently performing the functions of the chief justice in his absence, sought cooperation from the DC's to ensure justice for people. In a courtesy visit with the senior judge, the DCs called for digitisation of case documents and quick disposal of the cases related to lease of government properties."

      "text": " At least 10,000 people in four out of five upazilas in Rajbari and one in Faridpur were affected by floods as the Padma river started flowing over danger level at Goalando river port point. The four affected upazilas in Rajbari are Sadar, Pangsha, Kalukhali and Goalando. In Faridpur, 30 hectares of croplands in 15 villages under Sadar upazila have so far been flooded. In Rajbari alone, floodwaters have affected no less than 8,000 people and submerged nearly 400 hectares of croplands. Many inhabitants of char areas in both the districts started to move out to safety at different school buildings and embankments. Rajbari Deputy Commissioner Dilsad Begum said, \"4,000 families in four upazilas of Rajbari were affected by the flood. We distributed 33.7 metric tonnes of rice and 59 packets of dry food among the affected people.\" Fazlul Rahman, deputy director of Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) in Rajbari, said around 370 hectares of croplands and char areas that are outside the coverage area of the embankment were affected by the flood.  The DAE in the district is now preparing a list of affected farmers, he also said. \"At least 100 families in my union were affected by flood that inundated 1,000 bighas of croplands,\" said Abdus Salam, chairman of Borat Union Parishad in Rajbari Sadar upazila. Acting chairman Abdul Goni Mia of Daulatdia Union Parishad in Goalando upazila said, \"Some 2,000 people were affected by the flood in our union and they have taken shelter in safer places.\" Bilal Hossain, a member of Kalikapur Union Parishad in Kalukhali upazila, said, \"At least 6,000 people in two unions of our upazila were affected by flood. Some people residing outside the embankment of the river took shelter at their relatives' houses.\" Contacted, Rajbari Water Development Board Executive Engineer Sultan Mahmud said, \"The water level in the Padma has been rising since September 11 due to heavy rain upstream.\" He also said water in the Padma was flowing 13 centimetres above the danger level on Wednesday afternoon and the water level would continue to rise until October 5. In Faridpur Sadar upazila, North Channel Union Parishad Chairman Mohammad Mostakuzzaman said, \"People in 15 villages are affected by the flood. Especially farmers suffered heavy damages as their crops went under the flood water. Four concrete roads also went under water.\" DAE Deputy Director in Faridpur Kartik Chandra Chakrabarty said different char areas in Sadar upazila were flooded due to sudden rise in the water level of the Padma. At least 30 hectares of croplands went under water in the upazila, he confirmed.   Flash floods caused by five days' incessant rain in Gobindaganj upazila of Gaibandha washed away a 15-foot stretch of Fulpukuria-Baneshwar road in Dhuturabari area, reports our Gaibandha correspondent. Locals in the meantime have built a makeshift bamboo footbridge over the damaged section of the road that connects thousands with the upazila headquarters. Abdul Latif, engineer for Local Government Engineering Department in Gobindaganj upazila, said repair work of the damaged road will start after fall in water level in the area."

      "text": "We often equate Sundarban's wildlife with the Bengal Tiger. Indeed, it is a magnificent creature and justifiably captures our imagination. But you have to be extremely lucky so see it during a tourist trip to Sundarban. Thankfully, the diversity of wildlife in Sundarban extends well beyond the tiger. One can see many animals with moderate to high probability during a short tour of Sundarban. In my experience, the most commonly seen animals are deer, wild boars, monkeys, monitor lizards and dolphins. Somewhat less likely, but still very possible, are sightings of crocodiles, otters and snakes. Smaller wildlife include mudskippers, several types of crabs, a wide selection of beautiful butterflies (including the Sundarban Crow butterfly), and various insects, including Apis dorsata, the giant honeybee. Which is my favourite? The Spotted Deer of Sundarban (Axis axis) is possibly the most beautiful deer in the world. It is common and widespread in Sundarban. These are exquisite creatures with a rich, rust-coloured coat with white spots which persist through their life. Watching them is always a pleasurable experience for me. On every Sundarban trip I have taken, deer sightings have followed a pattern. Towards the beginning of the trip, soon after the launch enters the forest, I catch one or two glimpses of Spotted Deer. As the boat enters deeper into the forest, deer become more commonplace. For example, they can often be seen in places with stretches of Keora trees, where they stand on their hind legs to reach the leaves. The trees appear neatly and uniformly pruned at the height they can reach. Before the tour ends, there may be a large-scale sighting. While walking on a boardwalk such as the one in Kotka, I have seen large herds of Spotted Deer in the distance. Their movement is often dictated by the tides which flood the land around the boardwalk. They come in to eat the Keora leaves when the tide is low and start moving back inland as the tide rolls in. Therefore, being there during low tide increases your chances of seeing a large herd. The Rhesus Macaque monkey is sometimes found in the company of Spotted Deer. If the deer evokes calm and affectionate feelings in us, the Estuarine Crocodile elicits awe and fear. It can grow as large as twenty feet and weigh up to a thousand kilograms. This reptile is considered endangered in Sundarban, with perhaps 150 mature individuals living in the waterways of the forest. More often than not, it is spotted by a staff member of the boat when, to the tourists, it appears as a log lying on the riverbank. But as the boat comes closer, it becomes possible to discern its features including the long scaly tail which it uses like a whip to attack unsuspecting prey. It may look sleepy and relaxed, but when the boat comes too close for comfort, the crocodile can move into water with startling swiftness. On the waters of Sundarban you may see swimming lizards called Water Monitors. The confluence of two waterways is the best place to look for dolphins, which, being mammals, have to jump (briefly) for air. Snakes hibernate during winter and are more likely to be seen in summer and monsoon. My most memorable snake was a Monocled Cobra that nested inside the labyrinthine root of a giant uprooted Keora tree. The smaller green and brown vine snakes are more common but camouflage well. The Small-clawed Otter is by far the cutest wildlife of Sundarban. It is the subject of next week's column.   facebook.com/ikabirphotographs or follow \"ihtishamkabir\" on Instagram"

Although the Sunderbans, the largest mangrove forest, gets noticed for all the right reasons, monsoon in Ratargul is another surreal experience that can only be felt, and never fully explained. As the small boats move through the snaking waterways canopied by the lush foliage, often spreading as high as 15 metres, many feel, and some for the first time, that we are indeed part of nature; the environment around us.  \n Ratargul has the distinguished feature of supporting a diverse ecosystem of flora and fauna. Although the forest was completely natural at one point, the Forestry Department of Bangladesh has introduced some trees in the area. A conservative figure puts the number of plant species in the swamp at over 70. The diversity of animals and birds is equally mesmerising.    Monsoon is the right time to see Ratargul in its best; it seems that during the rainy season, Ratargul radiates the unmatched beauty that draws the large crowd from distant places. One needs to take permission from the forest office to visit the forest. Local boats can be hired to traverse the swamp. A popular destination in the wilderness is the tower, which offers an aerial view of the entire swamp. \n Essentials: After reaching Sylhet city, travel to the Fatehpur Union of Gowainghat in Sylhet district, south of the river Gowain. It is about 26 km from Sylhet city. One has the option to take CNGs, although cars too, can be rented. Tourists should be reminded that there are no dining options in the vicinity of the swamp. So, make sure you take some light meals that will last the two-way journey. And assuming you are travelling in monsoon, do not forget the umbrellas and the raincoats. Photo: Syed Asaduzzaman Suhan\n"

      "text": "The critical biodiversity areas in Cox's Bazar -- Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary, Himchhari National Park and Inani National Park -- face a grave risk of peril due to high level of human interventions following the Rohingya influx, according to two recent studies. Already, more than 2,000 hectares of forest have been lost as a result of the expansion of campsites after the arrival of over 750,000 Rohingyas since August 2017. Before the latest influx, more than 300,000 Rohingyas were already living in the area. Over the last one and a half years, tens of thousands of trees, both big and small, have been cut down to set up camps, make furniture and cook food, researchers have found. The financial cost of this destruction of forest in Ukhia and Teknaf upazilas stands at about Tk 1,865 crore, but the long-term consequences are more environmental than financial, according to a separate report by the Cox's Bazar Forest Department. \"Clearing of forests and vegetation enhances soil erosion and promote landslide,\" said Sharif Ahmed Mukul, director at the Applied Ecology and Conservation Research Lab at the Independent University, Bangladesh. He is one of the seven environment experts who wrote an article titled \"Rohingya Refugees and the Environment\" published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in the prestigious Science Magazine early this month. His fellow researchers include Prof Ainun Nishat, Saleemul Huq and Atiq Rahman. \"Expansion of the old Kutupalong camp blocked the only corridor used by the globally endangered Asian elephant as a migration route and trapped about 45 elephants in the western side of the camp,\" the report said. It also amplified human-elephant conflict, with 13 human casualties so far in the area. The remaining elephant habitat is under severe pressure from uncontrolled firewood collection in the forest, the article added.  Soil erosion and landslides are already common in the area, affecting water resources, irrigation, and groundwater reserves. But now, local biodiversity, including marine resources, acoustic environment, and air quality, is being degraded at an unprecedented rate. Sharif Ahmed said Rohingya people are now frequently visiting the Bay of Bengal for fishing and other aquatic resource collection, causing pressure on local marine species and the environment. \"Also, discharge of domestic and other waste is causing water pollution locally, and heavy pressure on local groundwater reserve because of mass refugee influx within a very short period in the area,\" he said. The other study, done by the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) and the IOM, also paints a sorry picture. The topography of Ukhia and Inani Forest range is diverse with almost flat land to medium hillocks. Approximately 10 percent landscape of the area is occupied with well drained flood plains, and soils of the site are sandy to sandy loam in highlands and clayey to silt clay in the depressions, the report said. \"The demand for firewood from forests is likely to be higher than the environment can supply. It may also exacerbate the effects of flooding and cyclone; as low-lying, degraded land will become more exposed,\" said the report. However, there are some positive changes too. The ICCCAD survey found that a year ago over 80 percent respondents used firewood as their main fuel, while around 20 percent used gas. But now around 39 percent of the Rohingya are using gas as their main fuel, and about 60 percent are still using fire wood. Some of them are using kerosene. As a way out, researchers have suggested providing Rohingyas with alternative fuel to reduce the pressure on the forest. Planting fast-growing trees in fallow and other unused land in the locality could solve the firewood problem. Sharif Ahmed said the major long-term strategy to improve the environmental condition in Cox's Bazar area should be forest and landscape restoration both inside and outside the camp, using local and native tree species. Creating and maintaining biodiversity corridors to facilitate elephant movement is also necessary to reduce human-elephant conflict and causalities in the area. Although the government and NGOs are already working on the issue and planting trees, efforts are still scattered and limited, he said. \"A sound coordination between different conservation, development and humanitarian agencies is also critical,\" he told The Daily Star. Humayun Kabir, Cox's Bazar divisional (south) forest officer, said the loss of forest and biodiversity due to the Rohingya settlements is irreparable, but the department is working on strategies to recover forest as much as possible. Mizanur Rahman, additional commissioner, Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission, said the government has instructed all organisations involved in refugee management to take up sustainable projects to help restore the forest.  \"Work at the grassroots level is already underway,\" he said."

      "text": "Rivers are no longer just rivers bound only by the laws of nature. The High Court has recently given a verdict awarding the status of \"living entities\" to the country's rivers in a bid to protect them and raise awareness of their importance. By any measure, this is a landmark judgement coming out of the court, a ringing endorsement of the fact that our rivers are in dire need of help. For the ordinary citizens, those caught between complicit spectatorship and dismay when it comes to the destruction of our rivers, it also offers a rare glimmer of hope. While the conferring of a legal status is a symbolic gesture, the High Court has also offered a realistic plan of action. It sought to strengthen the National River Protection Commission, which it assigned as the \"legal guardian\" of all rivers in the country, outlined a mechanism to implement their \"rights\" and also gave detailed instructions for several government agencies to that effect. So, what does it mean for rivers and their associated natural elements to have rights? Is a legal status enough to save our rivers? Since the verdict was given on February 3, there has been an ongoing debate about how effective it will be. Some people are less enthusiastic than others, and for good reasons. It's hard to believe a single move, however revolutionary, can alone bring change. Recall the last notable HC verdict on rivers--a ruling in 2009 about the demarcation of four rivers surrounding Dhaka--which was met with utter neglect, and nothing came of it eventually. But because of the groundbreaking nature of its content, the latest verdict will at least serve as a point of reference for evaluating all future endeavours in this regard, and may set in motion a groundswell of popular support for rivers which will embolden the activists. But in all fairness, there is a limit to what a court can and cannot do. It cannot, for example, transform a society that takes rivers for granted, or radically alter how the \"system\" works, or get the policymakers to see eye to eye with the experts on pressing environmental concerns, or dismantle the industrial-political complex that profits from riverbank encroachment. Rivers run through our country like veins run through the human body. This is hardly comforting when you consider that some of our rivers are already dead, some slowly approaching extinction. Like clots that form in our veins and cause life-threatening blockages, our rivers too are facing life-threatening challenges in the form of plastic litter, discarded packaging and various household and industrial wastes that stack up on their shores, choking and scarring them until they are robbed of their natural character; and then, you have the double whammy of sand extraction and what is popularly known as \"river grabbing\". The High Court's verdict is significant as it envisages a future for rivers shielded from all these manmade hazards, but any lingering doubt about its success will owe its existence partly to the challenge of clearing up this gargantuan mess that we've made over many years--and partly to the inflexible nature of our approach to rivers. Md Khalequzzaman, a professor of geology at the Lock Haven University, USA, posits that it will require more than a court order to undo all the damage that has been done to our rivers already. In an article published by The Daily Star recently, he put up a list of things-to-do for the verdict to bear fruit. Everyone has a part in it: the parliament, politicians, citizens, industries, the implementing agencies. It will take \"a concerted effort and a commitment from everyone\" for the verdict to be implemented, he said, outlining his view of what possible role each can play and the changes that will be required. For the government, a major challenge will be to address the seismic fault lines within its existing river policy to make it compatible with the High Court's vision for rivers. A recent interview of two well-known environmental activists by The Daily Star's online Bangla site highlighted several such fault lines, including the drive against riverbank encroachment. The drive, said architect Iqbal Habib, is usually done without any conservation plan for the post-eviction period. \"An unplanned drive is actually harmful and counterproductive,\" he said, explaining that often a vacated place is reoccupied and illegal structures crop up again as soon the drive is over. The worst part is that those in charge of the drive have demonstrably little knowledge of how to preserve riverbanks and keep them open and accessible and free of all structures. \"It is difficult to assume that the same persons who have frustrated us in the past will not do the same in the future.\" Dr Abdul Matin, general secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (Bapa), believes the government's river policy is riddled with contradictions. \"We've often noted contradictions in the government's actions. The government's approach to rivers is not correct; it doesn't fit with that of environmentalists. The government is principally of the view that it is okay for it to interfere in rivers as part of its development work or as a means of flood control,\" he said. He thinks a river policy should be based on scientific considerations. In this connection, he drew attention to the fact that Bangladesh didn't ratify the 1997 UN Watercourses Convention which is widely regarded as an important document on river use and conservation and a guideline for establishing laws governing waters. \"The Bangladesh government has been trapped in the labyrinth of its own misguided policy because of its refusal to recognise and abide by the UN convention. All its projects are being undertaken based on this wrong policy. Sometimes illegal structures on river banks are demolished, but at the same time, government structures [and even private ones] built inside rivers are spared. It symbolises an inconsistency within the government caused by its own policy blunder,\" Dr Matin said. Clearly, some of our laws and plans will need a radical revision and realignment in light of the vision set by the High Court. The society has to transform itself, too, to be truly worthy of its rivers, to co-exist, not to coerce into submission or destroy. If it feels like a civilisational wakeup call, it is because the situation is that much dire. But the bigger challenge right now will be to implement the court verdict, directive by directive, as no half-measures and quick fixes--which usually follow court verdicts of this nature--will be enough. The court has done its part to protect our rivers. The spotlight is now on the administration. Badiuzzaman Bay is a member of the editorial team at The Daily Star. Email:badiuzzaman.bd@gmail.com"

Rajdhani Unnyan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) has also taken a simultaneous initiative to develop another 3,000-acre township styled Waterfront Smart City Dhaka, close to its ongoing Jheelmil residential area in Keraniganj. To the end of developing both the schemes, Rajuk signed an agreement with Chinese firm China Road and Bridge Corporation, at a city hotel yesterday to carry out a feasibility study. The Turag township development scheme is aimed at conserving extensive conservable flood flow zones and wetlands along the western bank of the river, said high officials of Rajuk and public works ministry at the signing ceremony. In the face of unrelenting conversion of flood flow zones and waterbodies -- earmarked as conservable in the master plan -- through earth-filling in and around the capital, the Turag project has been undertaken to protect such ecologically sensitive regions along the river, they said.  Nearly 62 percent of the Turag township area will be conserved as water-based and recreational area and the rest will be developed as residential and commercial, they added.               \"Conservation of the flood flow zones and wetlands is the aim of the scheme with well-designed development,\" said public works secretary Md Shahid Ullah Khandaker. The city loses an unknown amount of wetland every day due to poor management, he said. \"So, the prime minister has directed for conservation of the Turag flood flow zones and wetlands for a sustainable capital city,\" he added. The Turag township will be within the catchment area of the country's maiden metro rail service, he said.  Rajuk Chairman Dr Sultan Ahmed said Turag township scheme is a part of the master plan to save four Dhaka rivers, and its feasibility study will include environmental study as well. \"In case of land acquisition for the township schemes, those affected will be rehabilitated with plots and flats,\" said the Rajuk chairman. The feasibility study will be completed in the next one year, he said.  The Waterfront Smart City Dhaka in Keraniganj will be developed as an independent planned township by the Dhaka-Mawa highway to meet the increased residential and commercial demands, and prevent the current trend of chaotic housing and commercial development in this locality, said the officials. Public Works Minister SM Rezaul Karim and the chief engineer of China Road and Bridge Corporation, among others, spoke."

      "text": "Nayan Ahmed started searching for a job since his graduation in 2016. Every day, he browses through newspapers and online job portals for employment opportunities in public service and spends hours to ready himself. A student of political science at Govt BL College in Khulna, Nayan did sit several recruitment tests for government jobs. But his cherished job remains elusive. \"I have given up hope of getting a government job. Now I have to get any job to support my family,\" said a frustrated Nayan, who came to Dhaka three months ago from his Bagerhat home in search of a job. His father retired from government service five years ago. Elder of two brothers, Nayan must now provide for his family. Like him, thousands of students of government and non-government colleges affiliated with the National University (NU) lose the first few years after completing their graduation in search of jobs, often dubbed a \"golden deer\" in Bangladesh. A World Bank study has found as high as 46 percent National University students remain unemployed for at least three years on completion of their graduation. \"This share is very high in any standard. Unemployment thus is a grave issue for graduates from NU-affiliated colleges and requires special attention,\" said the study report released on March 31. The study -- Graduate Employability of Affiliated Colleges: New Evidence from Bangladesh -- began in October 2016. In Bangladesh, around 20 lakh job-seekers enter the labour market each year. Currently, 1,862 colleges are affiliated with the NU and the number keeps rising every year. More than 18 lakh students are currently enrolled in these colleges, which accounts for 68 percent of the total enrolment at higher education level, the study said, citing Bangladesh Bureau of Education Information and Statistics data. In 2017, as many as 5.46 lakh students were studying in the final years of various academic programmes -- Degree Pass Course, Honours and Master's -- with the NU. The study is based on interview with 2,350 graduates from NU-affiliated colleges, 235 employers of currently employed graduates, and principals and vice-principals of 35 government and non-government colleges. It found that an unemployed graduate applied for 17 jobs since the start of unemployment before they could find a job. On the other hand, about three in every four unemployed college graduates received at least one job offer that they declined mainly because of poor salary packages. Overall, 66 percent male graduates remained unemployed against 77 percent of their female counterparts. Unemployment rate is relatively lower in metropolitan areas, with the rural-urban ratio standing at 72:58. Of those unemployed, highest 74 percent are from humanities group, followed by 69 percent from business discipline and 66 percent from science group. \"It's a dismal picture,\" said Prof Abdul Mannan, the immediate past chairman of the University Grants Commission. \"We don't need certificate-oriented graduates. The man and his knowledge and skills behind the certificate are what is important,\" he told The Daily Star. \"The key problem is skill mismatch,\" said Zahid Hussain, lead economist at the WB's Dhaka office. The knowledge and skills that the graduates acquire in colleges have little application at work, which makes the National University-affiliated college education less relevant in the labour market. \"College graduates often lack relevant skills valued by employers. The core of the problem is on the supply side, reflected in the form of inadequacies of quality and weak relevance of education and skills of college graduates,\" Zahid said. In the study, more than half of the students surveyed said that they acquired \"a lot of new skills and knowledge\" through academic and off-campus activities. But all of this have little use in workplace, which makes the NU college education less relevant in job market, the report said. \"This is disappointing as college education is supposed to teach new skills and improve the knowledge base of the students.\" It also found that only one-third of the employed graduates have been able to apply their knowledge and skills in their work usefully. \"College graduates failed to acquire practical knowledge and skills during their time of college study,\" it said. Prof Hafiz Md Hasan Babu, pro-vice chancellor of NU, acknowledged that the curricula of the National University and most other public universities did not reflect the requirements of job market. \"This is a big weakness of our university curricula,\" he said. Employers acknowledge that college graduates are strong in communication in Bangla and possess decent work attitude, but are weak in English language and computer skills. More than half of the 235 employers interviewed said colleges should focus on problem-solving skills and team-work skills to improve the overall quality of college graduates. They also want the colleges to strengthen training on ICT, English language skills and communication skills. The employers believe that business and specific skills-related subjects like computer science, finance and accounting, marketing, management, English, mathematics, and statistics are the most relevant subjects in the job market. \"The results of this survey clearly demonstrate that the current subject-wise distribution of student enrolment in colleges are not well aligned with the employers' preferences of expertise of job candidates,\" said Zahid Hussain. On the other hand, only 4 percent of the 235 employers interviewed reported having some type of relationship with colleges. Only three employers said they had partnerships for recruitment and only two reported having a partnership for apprenticeship programme with colleges, the report said. \"Having solid partnership with industries would play a pivotal role in increasing the employability of college students and improving their relevant skills,\" said the study. The job market has become skills-driven. \"Therefore, the graduates should be equipped with the right set of skills to make them employable in the fast-changing job market,\" Prof Mannan said. For this reason, the education system needs to be revamped. The authorities should continuously update their curriculum and design it for the industries of the future rather than the industries of the past, he said. \"Training of the trainers and educators is also a must,\" he said."

      "text": "Unlike other years, cattle markets in different districts including Pabna, Sirajganj, Thakurgaon and Panchagarh are yet to see sufficient sale of sacrificial animals although the Eid-ul-Azha is only a few days away. Our Pabna Correspondent reports: The markets in Pabna and Sirajganj see adequate supply of sacrificial animals, but the prices offered by the buyers are still much below the expectation of cattle farmers and traders. \"I bought three fattened cows, each weighing above five maunds, with target to sell each for at least Tk 1.10 lakh, which would bring me a minimum profit but none offered more than Tk one lakh. Most of the buyers in the market want small and medium-sized cattle,\" said cattle trader Abdul Mazid, who came from Dogasi village in Pabna Sadar upazila to Hazirhaat, a big cattle market, on Friday. Abul Kashem of Baoikola village in Pabna's Atghoria upazila came with his five cows, weighing 5.5 maunds to 6 maunds, with hope to sell each for Tk 1.25 lakh to Tk 1.5 lakh but he did not get the expected price. \"Due to the soaring price of cattle feed, now we have to spend more for making a cow healthy. I have to spend Tk 1.2 lakh to Tk 1.3 lakh for making each cow ready for market,\" Kashem said. A large cow weighing 42 maunds has remained unsold at the house of farmer Minarul Islam of Dathia village in Pabna's Chatmohar upazila. \"I bought the cow for Tk 6 lakh a couple of years ago and named it Tiger. I spent at least Tk 15 lakh for making it ready for sale as a sacrificial animal. I expected to get Tk 30 lakh for it but so far I have got the highest offer of Tk 18 lakh,\" Minarul said. Meanwhile, the demand of medium and small sized cattle sees a rise ahead of Eid. \"I have already sold 10 medium-sized cattle for Tk 40 thousand to 60 thousand each, and expect to sell more 20 to 25 cows in next 10 days,\" said Md Intaz Ali, a cattle trader of Baoikola village of Pabna's Atghoria upazila. Talking with this correspondent, livestock officials in Pabna and Sirajganj said the two districts are expected to supply around 10 percent of the country's total demand of approximately 1.2 crore animals during the Eid-ul-Azha this year. There are adequate supply of local variety of cows and the overall production is more than enough, they said. \"In Sirajganj, 4.19 lakh sacrificial animals, including 1.02 lakh fattened ones, have been prepared ahead of the Eid-ul-Azha,\" said Akhtaruzzaman Bhuiya, livestock officer of Sirajganj. In Pabna, more than five lakh sacrificial animals, of them 88,500 fattened cattle, have been prepared, said Al Mamun, Pabna district's livestock officer. If the Indian cattle do not come to the local markets, cattle farmers and traders will get profit this year, he said. Our Thakurgaon correspondent reports: Cattle markets in Thakurgaon and Panchagarh districts are yet to witness sufficient sale of the sacrificial animals ahead of Eid-ul-Azha.     During a visit to different cattle markets in the two districts on Saturday and Sunday, this correspondent talked to a number of stakeholders. Buying and selling at the cattle markets are yet to start in full swing as traders from other districts are absent this time while the local buyers consider the prices a bit high, said Md Zaman, lessee of Matherganj cattle market in Thakurgaon Sadar upazila. \"Cattle traders who usually visit different markets of the district might prefer to go to flood-affected areas as the cattle farmers of those areas are compelled to sell their animals for lower prices due to fodder crisis and other problems, Zaman said. Prices will drop in the next few days if the outside traders do not come as there are a large number of animals ready for sale for sacrificial purpose in the district, said Kosirul Islam, a cattle trader in Fakirganj cattle market in Atwary upazila of Panchagarh.    Osman, a cattle trader in Boda upazila of Panchagarh, said he bought two medium-sized bulls for Tk 82,000 about a month ago, but has not been able to sell them yet.  Cattle farmer Md Islam said, \"I reared a bull for one year which has now grown to a medium-sized (about 85 kg) one. I expected to sell it for Tk 45,000 to Tk 50,000 but buyers are offering around Tk 40,000.\" \"In Thakurgaon district, 52,309 families and farm owners raised 58,148 cows, 25,536 goats and sheep and 266 buffaloes under the cattle fattening programme targeting Eid-ul-Azha. About 77,000 cattle are needed during Eid-ul-Azha in the district,\" said Md Abdur Rahim, acting livestock officer of the district. In Panchagarh, 10,242 families and farm owners reared 48,307 cows, 11 buffaloes and 17,756 goats under the cattle fattening programme centring Eid-ul-Azha, district's livestock officials said.  "

      "text": "A migraine can cause severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation, usually on one side of the head. In most cases they hamper and alter our lifestyle to a great extent. Here are some migraine hacks that you may find helpful. Slip on shades: Does light makes you wince in pain? If you cannot dim the brightness around you by drawing the curtains or turning off the lights, make your own darkness and wear sunglasses indoors. Stick to a schedule: The key word is 'regular'. Pick set times to go to bed and wake up every day. Exercise regularly. Stick to usual times for meals and snacks. Get a grip on stress: It is one of the biggest triggers for migraine pain. So aim to boost calm in your life. If you stay stressed during the work week and relax only on the weekend, the shift can bring on migraine, too. Block the scents: If someone's perfume or other odours set off your migraine, reach for a soothing scent like mint or coffee beans. Turn up the heat: Warm compresses, a steamy shower, or a toasty soak in a bath can ease the tension of tight muscles that might add to your migraine pain. Tame screen glare: Blue light is usually the hardest hue to handle when you deal regularly with migraine. That is the color that glows from your computer and smartphone. So break away from screens when you feel a migraine coming on. Breathe mindfully: Focus as you breathe in and out for at least 10 minutes. That can flood your body with calm and lower your stress. Boost your relaxation and target the different muscle groups in your body. Mute the noise: Migraine can be triggered by just about any of your senses, including your hearing. Just like lights, loud noise can set off your migraine. Get to a quiet space when it hits. If you cannot, carry earplugs to block out the din on the spot."

      "text": "Speakers at a roundtable yesterday said a taskforce should be formed to monitor disbursement of the government's climate budget. The joint monitoring taskforce can be comprised of different ministries, government and non-government organisations, civil society, academics and journalists, they said. ActionAid Bangladesh and International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) jointly arranged the roundtable on \"Bangladesh Climate Budget FY2019-2020: A CSO Analysis and Reflection\" at The Daily Star Centre. For 2019-20 fiscal, the government has allocated Tk 23,748.53 crore as \"climate budget\" for 25 ministries and divisions, according to a handout provided at the roundtable. This climate budget is 7.81 percent of total allocation for the ministries and divisions, which received a cumulative allocation of 58.11 percent of the national budget, says the handout, referring to data from the government's \"Climate Financing for Sustainable Development: Budget Report 2019-20\".   In 2015-16 fiscal, the government allocated Tk 12,163.36 crore as \"climate budget\", it says. Addressing the roundtable, ICCCAD Director Saleemul Huq said the taskforce can generate feedback each year. In doing so, it can play an important role in making future climate budgets more transparent. It can also help increase the country's capability in understanding climate change and its impacts, he said, adding those who are involved in preparing the government's climate budget need to understand climate change in-depth. \"Not everything is about climate change,\" he said, adding that sea-level rise and saline intrusion are impacts of climate change. On the other hand, disasters like cyclone, flood and drought are natural phenomena but can intensify and occur more frequently due to climate change, he further said. ActionAid Bangladesh Country Director Farah Kabir said besides the government's climate budget, there is a need to know how much the non-government sector spends on climate change-related initiatives each year. A paper can be produced to this end, she said, moderating the session. The government's investment on infrastructure development should be validated scientifically to ensure that those infrastructures will be climate adaptive, said Practical Action Bangladesh Country Director Hasin Jahan. M Khalid Mahmood, joint secretary (planning and development) of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, said they conduct impact analysis and necessary research first before undertaking any plan -- whether it is related to climate change or not. The government has increased its investment on climate change-related initiatives over the years and is trying to reduce a gap between its efforts and emergence of climate change impacts, he said."

Bangladesh sustained strong growth in fiscal year 2018-2019, according to a report titled 'Bangladesh Development Update October 2019: Tertiary Education and Job Skills' launched today by WB at its Dhaka office. The GDP growth rate for 2018-2019, officially estimated at 8.1 per cent, was higher than the previous fiscal year's rate of 7.9 per cent, the report says, though it predicts a relatively lower growth for the upcoming fiscal year. Inflation is likely to rise modestly for reasons which include increased natural gas prices and possible crop production losses due to flood, the report explains.         Reforms in the financial sector, closing the infrastructure gap, and implementation of the Annual Development Plan are crucial for the country's progress, the report adds. It warns of uncertainty in global economy, domestic risk in financial sector and exchange rate appreciation that may create a challenge for Bangladesh's competitiveness. World Bank Country Director for Bangladesh and Bhutan, Mercy Miyang Tembon said, \"Bangladesh's economy is projected to maintain strong growth backed by sound macroeconomic fundamentals and progress in structural reforms.\" She said, \"To achieve this growth vision, Bangladesh will need a high productivity economy. Human capital development that is responsive to labour market demand for higher level skills and to rapid technological advancements will be crucial.\" World Bank Senior Economist and co-author of the report Bernard Haven said, \"Labour market surveys repeatedly show that employers struggle to fill high-skill positions such a s technicians and managers.\" \"To bridge the demand and supply gap, the country must invest in skills training; ensure equitable access of female and poor students; establish public funding mechanism to develop market-relevant skills; and put in place an effective regulatory and accountability framework.\" Only 19 per cent of college graduates are employed full-time or part-time and more than a third of tertiary level graduates remain unemployed one or two years after graduation, observes the report."

      "text": "Local women in Pirojpur's wetland areas play a vital role in floating agriculture that is recognised by Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN as one of the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems. The unique system, locally known as 'dhap', is being practised for over three centuries in flood-prone areas of Nazirpur and Nesarabad upazilas under Pirojpur and Banaripara upazila under Barishal where water remains for a prolonged period of time.   Many farmers there grow vegetables while others grow vegetable seedlings all throughout the year on floating beds that are primarily made from water hyacinth and other aquatic weeds. Up to 2,000 plants can be grown on each floating bed that can be used for at least five times in a year.   While men mostly work on the floating beds, other members of their family, especially women, take part in making spherical objects in which seeds are sown or seedlings are planted. After finishing household chores, the women gather around a spot and use various aquatic weeds to roll up the objects they call 'doulla'. \"Before setting the doullas on the floating beds, we [women] sow seeds or plant saplings in those,\" said Nasrin Begum from Mugarjhor village in Nazirpur upazila.  Sultana from the same area said, \"Time flies by while we make doullas and chitchat till dusk.\" After seeds are planted, the doulas are kept in an area for at least two days for sprouting, said Hafiza Begum, another woman from the same village. The women said they can make nearly two thousand doullas a day and some of them are even getting paid for making doullas. \"The money comes in handy for my family's needs,\" said Nurjahan from Balodia village in Pirojpur's Nesarabad upazila. In some cases, saplings are planted in the doullas. After the seedlings or saplings are ready, men transport the doullas in boats and place those on floating beds.  Farmer Zakir Hossain said the role of women in floating agriculture is an important one as their contribution eases workload of men."

      "text": "Ashraful Islam, a retired government official, built a two-story house in Dhaka's east Jurain neighbourhood in 1996. He spent his forty years of savings and even exhausted his wife's fixed deposit to build this dwelling. After completing all the tasks, he and his wife named it \"Niribili\" (tranquil). \"My only hope was that I could secure a shelter for my wife and children in Dhaka,\" says Ashraf. \"I gathered all my assets and invested everything to build the house. With my hard-earned money, I could only afford to purchase a plot in east Jurain. It never looked healthy--I never liked the narrow lanes and the convoluted network of uncovered sewerage lines all over the place. However, I liked its remoteness from the hubbub of the city. With three of my children, I and my wife spent some of the best years of my life in my home.\"   His family's peaceful days were numbered. \"In 1998, most parts of Jurain were flooded but the lane adjacent to my home was spared thanks to the local people's initiative of sandbagging the nearby Kutubkhali canal. However, later that year, we noticed that the flood water was not receding. Instead, the water level inside the neighbourhood was rising due to intermittent rainfall throughout the year. We removed the sandbags from the canals to drain away the clogged water but to no avail. Gradually, the rising water engulfed the entire neighbourhood.\" The situation worsened when all the waste from the overflowing sewerage lines got mixed with the clogged water which started to flood the ground floor of many buildings of east Jurain. As a result, many inhabitants like Ashraf had to leave the neighbourhood forever. \"My precious plot of land which I bought with all my savings is now submerged under filthy water. Niribili lies abandoned and decaying. At 73, I and my ageing wife are living in a congested, rented apartment in Khilgaon,\" says Ashraf.  Ashraful is only one of many east Jurain inhabitants who lost all their belongings to permanent water logging. Jurain has been battling persistent flooding for more than 20 years, but no effective measure has been taken to solve this crisis which has now turned into a catastrophe. In some parts of the locality, local people covered the roads with dirt and sand to increase their height so as to keep it free from water logging. Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) has also been implementing a costly project of Tk 28 crore to increase the height of all the major roads in east Jurain. In some parts, they have been implementing this project for more than a decade. It has submitted another project of taka 10 crore to increase the height of all the lanes. According to DSCC officials, the first phase of road restoration will be finished by December this year. However, instead of solving the water-logging crisis, DSCC's road restoration project has deteriorated the situation. Some lanes such as Commissioner Road, Shobujbag, Nurani Masjid road, and Haji Kala Mian Sardar road have been heightened up to six to 10 feet. As a result, the ground floors of most buildings along these roads are fully or half-buried. Most of the first and second storey windows are barely adjacent to the restored roads. As the gates to the staircases became buried and unusable, their dwellers had to pull down some parts of the walls to create doorways, making these structures extremely weak and unsafe.  A large number of abandoned and half buried buildings gives a desolate and haunted look to this area despite it being one of the most over-populated parts of Dhaka city. Anyone unfamiliar with the crisis might think that the entire zone was badly affected by an earthquake and subsequent flood. Inhabitants of many of these buildings were forced to leave their homes and shop and factory owners had to close their establishments. The water logging situation remains the same and, due to the increased height of the roads, run-off water from the lanes now also leaks into the buildings. Araj Ali Sarder, a local inhabitant who owns a grocery shop and an apartment on Commissioner Road says, \"I had to close my shop due to this road restoration project. We, the local people here, had hoped that the DSCC would drain out the clogged water and we would be able to live and run our businesses in peace. Instead of taking out the water, they are just making us jobless and homeless. I have had to demolish my shop twice to keep it on the same level as the road. But the problem is they don't restore the road entirely in one go. This year, they perhaps increased the height of the road to four feet. Next year, they might come again to raise it up to five feet to cope with the increasing water level. In this way, our locality is becoming increasingly unliveable and we have become victims to the whimsies of the government officials.\" The never-ending road construction and maintenance has also caused other hazards. Due to the constant digging, the existing sewerage system has been completely destroyed and has never been repaired. During holidays, when many people stay at home and use water for household chores, many lanes of the lanes in east Jurain become even more flooded. Thousands of people have to live with floating human waste and filth all around their houses. Road construction has also caused severe dust pollution in the area. \"In addition to typhoid, diarrhoea, and skin diseases, our children are suffering from constant coughing due to intolerable dust pollution. On dry, hot days we cannot go outside without a mask. We cannot see objects even a few yards away due to a thick layer of dust in the air. Nobody actually cares about our sufferings,\" says Araj. Leakage in gas pipelines is also a frequent incident in Jurain. Subterrenean gas pipelines are so leaked and damaged by the road restoration project that very few homes can use their gas connections. Residents live with the risk of fatal accidents that can happen any time. DSCC, however, denies these allegations. Mithun Chandra Shil, executive engineer, zone-5 of DSCC says, \"We are restoring the roads due to frequent requests from the local inhabitants. As they realised that they had no other alternative to increasing the height of the roads, we have taken up this project upon their request. In our survey, we found that there are some higher roads in Jurain which do not get flooded during monsoon. We are trying to raise the height of all the lanes up to that level. We shall be able to complete restoration of the main lanes by December this year. We are expecting to start restoring the other lanes soon, which will significantly solve the problem.\"  Nevertheless, DSCC's strategy to solve the crisis is not liked by many as it does not address the root cause of the problem. Mijanur Rahman, a renowned social worker who hit the headlines several times for his bold and innovative demonstrations highlighting the crises in east Jurain, was born and brought up in this neighbourhood. He focuses on the history of this locality which helps identify the origin of the crisis. In the 1960s, most parts of Jurain were low-lying floodplains where local farmers could grow poor quality rice only once a year. \"Even in the late 1970s there were large tracts of rice fields in this area. The farmers here could not grow good quality rice because this area is shaped like a sink. All the surrounding areas like Dolairpar, Jurain rail-gate, and Dania are almost 10 feet higher than east Jurain. Therefore, rainwater used to flow down to this area and during monsoon, it would be heavily inundated, making it unsuitable for cultivation,\" says Mijan. In 1965, the then Pakistan government started the Dhaka-Narayanganj-Demra (DND) embankment project to improve irrigation and to protect Dhaka from flooding. The croplands used to be irrigated with a network of canals such as Titas, Kutubkhali, Shobujbag, Shyampur etc. These canals also carried excess water to the Buriganga river and prevented waterlogging in the neighbourhood. According to Mijan, in the late 1970s, people from different parts of the country started to purchase croplands and erect houses indiscriminately. There was no sewerage system and waste management system, and no proper road networks, in Jurain even in the early 1990s. In the absence of any town planning, the entire east Jurain area became one of the most densely populated residential areas of the city. As a result, the network of canals which used to work as a drainage system for the entire area was filled up to make way for residential housing; many of them were even simply blocked by piles of solid waste. At present, many of these canals are completely lost due to encroachment, and most parts of Titas and Kutubkhali canals are blocked by huge amounts of waste. \"I and many inhabitants of east Jurain think that the restoration of these canals, maintenance of dilapidated sewerage system, and development of a waste management system are the only feasible solutions to the present crisis. Repairing roads and increasing their heights will only deteriorate the situation,\" says Mijan. Mijan's concern is shared by the engineers of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), who have also been working to prevent waterlogging in the area. Abdul Matin, superintendent engineer of BWDB says, \"Since the entire east Jurain is like a large basin, vertical rise of the area by reconstructing roads is not a feasible solution. The nearby localities and the highway that connects Jurain and Narayanganj are still 10 feet higher than the lanes of east Jurain. Rain and floodwater coming from those parts can still inundate east Jurain. If these lanes are raised up to 10 feet to prevent inundation, even two or three storeyed buildings will become buried and unliveable in those areas. To solve the crisis, we are installing water pumps in key water collection points of DND embankments. Canals are also being restored so that our pumps can receive sufficient amount of water to drain it away on the other side of the embankment.\" Abdul assures us that three pumps will be installed by June 2020 and that these three pumps will be enough to solve waterlogging. But only one pump has been installed so far and it is not getting sufficient water due to clogged canals. According to BWDB officials, army engineers in coordination with DSCC and BWDB have been cleaning the canals but due to the lack of an effective waste management system, local people dispose of their garbage in the canals, which blocks the water flow. \"Last year, the Kutubkhali canals had been cleaned and restored three times a year. But we found it choked with garbage within one or two months after restoration,\" says Abdul. Mohammad Nur Hossain, councillor of ward 53 of DSCC--which constitutes east Jurain--says in this regard, \"Most of the inhabitants of east Jurain are not that educated. DSCC runs mobile waste collection services here and has also installed large dustbins. But very few people use those facilities and most of them throw their garbage into the canals. There is no alternative to launching massive information campaigns to make people aware of the importance of the canals. Without restoring these canals, the waterlogging problem in Jurain will never be solved.\" Due to round-the-year waterlogging, no sewerage system, and unplanned infrastructural reforms, east Jurain has become one of the worst places to live in Dhaka city. Tens of thousands of Dhakaites live in an intolerably unhygienic environment in this neighbourhood. Procrastination in implementing the ongoing waterlogging prevention projects due to bureaucratic complexities among different government agencies has been deteriorating the situation by the day. Hundreds of inhabitants like Ashraful have already abandoned the area, leaving behind their valuable properties. The haunted skeletons of vacated and ruined houses still stand as the witnesses to a failed system that has turned a thriving neighbourhood into a hellish, uninhabitable place.

      "text": "It is now clear that the Bangladesh government is all set to relocate nearly 100,000 Rohingya refugees to Bhasan Char, a remote island off its coast, starting April 2019. All preparations and logistics are nearly ready. Available reports indicate that the United Nations is finally helping to facilitate the relocation plan. However, the UNHCR international protection chief called for \"voluntary\" relocation of refugees to this new remote home on the Bhasan Char. The move is opposed reportedly by many refugees because they fled Myanmar to save their life; and don't want to risk it now by living on the char in the middle of the Bay of Bengal. My own view published in The Daily Star over a year ago (January 7, 2018) was that refugee relocation to Bhasan Char would be a great mistake. The relocation of 100,000 refugees, only one-tenth of the refugee population in Cox's Bazar, is not going to ease congestion or overcrowding in the camps as claimed by the government nor reduce and/or minimise the growing conflict with the host population. Even if dispersal and resettlement was required to lessen the pressure on the squalid settlements in the camps, why relocate such a huge number of refugee population to an inaccessible and physically hostile environment on a remote island in the Bay of Bengal? There is perhaps no clear answer or response to this as yet. We all know that the Bhasan Char was not readily available for refugee resettlement. The Bangladesh government spent its own USD 280 million to transform this 20-year-old uninhabited island char to a secured and planned settlement with flood defence embankments, roads, housing quarters, water supply, solar panels, power, emergency shelters, helipad and other infrastructural amenities. The Bangladesh Navy supervised a team of British and Chinese engineers who worked for over two years to complete the site. The site consists of 120 blocks. Each block with 12 buildings for a total of 1,440 buildings to house 100,000 refugees. The available covered space for each refugee is about 3.6 metres, barely meeting the UN emergency standard of 3.5m per person. The infrastructure developed in the Bhasan Char is huge and surely very expensive for refugee relocation on a temporary basis unless the Bangladesh Navy has other intended use for the facility in future. In Cox's Bazar, mobilisation is underway for compiling a list of the first refugees to be moved on the basis of voluntary relocation. The bulk of the families for relocation have been targeted from Camp 15, which is the second largest camp in Ukhiya, only after Kutapalong. Over the past couple of months, officials in charge of various camps known as Camp-in-Charge (CIC) have shown videos of Bhasan Char to the refugees and explained the various facilities built there for their families. After each video was shown, the Majhis (camp leaders) typically showed a positive attitude to the new site in the presence of the CICs. However, in private, they seem to have no interest in moving to the distant and isolated char in the Bay of Bengal. The overwhelming preference is to remain in Ukhiya, which is a safe haven for the refugees, and is not too far from the Myanmar border. The proximity to Myanmar keeps them socially and culturally alive as Rohingya people. They also get familial information from Rakhine almost on a daily basis through informal channels. Furthermore, many families depend on remittances from their relatives and family members working in the Gulf and Middle East. So, the refugees have no interest in moving to Bhasan Char without any telecommunication connections or any easy and dependable transportation with the mainland. Many fear the isolation and lack of freedom there. \"Don't send me to the island,\" a poem written by a Rohingya refugee went viral on social media. It read: \"I am a human being, I deserve all human rights.\" Bhasan Char is typically a three to four hour-long trip by boat from the mainland. The World Food Program (WFP) has already raised concerns, based on their initial assessments, on the viability of safely relocating the refugees to the island within the context of food security and other emergency considerations. There are no clear-cut answers yet on their future employment and livelihood on the island except for fishing and farming, as one official mentioned. The island has an estimated 13,000 acres of land; of this, a 1,500-acre area is circled by a 9-foot (or three-metre) flood embankment, short of 21-foot barrier recommended by WFP. The remainder of the land is not available for year-round cultivation and subject to flooding. Bhasan Char is located in an area vulnerable to periodic violent cyclones. There are recorded data for cyclone disasters in the area going back to the 1960s. The cyclone of 1970 was the deadliest, killing 500,000 people. The 1991 cyclone was responsible for the death of an estimated 200,000 people (some accounts estimate the figure to be as high as 300,000). The 1991 cyclone was associated with tidal surges up to six-metre high in the offshore islands. The 1991 cyclone also destroyed 197 km of coastal embankments. Several thousand people from the coastal belts died during cyclone Sidr in 2003 and Aila in 2009. So there is reasonable fear, risk and uncertainty. Yanghee Lee, the UN Special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, is unsure whether the island is \"truly habitable\". As a host country, Bangladesh is struggling with the influx and the overcrowded camps. However, overcrowding is a common experience in refugee camps globally. The focus should be more on the safety and security of refugees, with the ultimate objective being the repatriation of refugees to their homeland. The dispersal and relocation to Bhasan Char or other alternative settlements in the future may give the wrong signal to Myanmar that Bangladesh is perhaps slowly absorbing the refugee population. Thus, the relocation to Bhasan Char may potentially complicate refugee repatriation and resettlement. Bangladesh should work with the international community, more particularly the superpowers, to resolve the current standoff and force Myanmar for speedy repatriation with the full rights and citizenship of the Rohingyas restored.

      "text": "Following failure to sign agreements on the Teesta and Feni rivers, Dhaka and Delhi are now stepping towards a new deal on six small rivers and optimum use of the Ganges water treaty. The six rivers are Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gumti, Dharla and Dudhkumar, officials said, adding that all the 54 transboundary rivers of the two countries would eventually come under the framework agreement.   \"We have collected data on these six rivers for preparing the framework agreement,\" said member of a technical committee, formed following a secretary-level Indo-Bangla meeting early August.   The agreement will be discussed during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ongoing visit to New Delhi where she is scheduled to meet her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi and co-chair the Indian Economic Summit being held on October 3-4.   The agreement, however, will not be signed this time, said officials.  In 2011, Bangladesh and India failed to sign the Teesta water-sharing agreement due to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's last-minute opposition during the then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Dhaka.  Even today, the issue remains unresolved. In such a situation, farmers in Bangladesh's northern region depend heavily on underground water for irrigation. Though the two countries have 54 rivers in common, treaty on water sharing was signed only on one river -- the Ganges -- in 1996. Dhaka is frustrated over the Teesta issue, especially when it has allowed transit facilities for transportation of Indian goods from one part of India to another through Bangladesh. Also, Dhaka addressed Delhi's most important concern by not sheltering any Indian insurgents -- something that facilitate stability in India's Northeastern region. Against this backdrop, Indian Water Resources Secretary Upendra Prasad Singh flew to Dhaka early August to attend a secretary-level meeting on water sharing. Indian External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar also met his Bangladeshi counterpart Dr AK Abdul Momen in Dhaka late August when the water issue prominently came up for discussions. The secretary-level meet also discussed forming two technical committees -- one on conducting feasibility study on the optimum use of water received under the Ganges treaty and the other on data collection of the six rivers. The member of a technical committee told The Daily Star on October 2 that the committee had collected information on the water flow of the rivers. Soon, they would meet their Indian counterpart to exchange similar data. \"The agreement will be prepared based on the data,\" the water expert said. \"We are looking at how we can modernise our system of flood forecasting by sharing of water flow data,\" he added. The two countries are also working on curbing pollution of the common rivers and \"sharing the best practices\" with each other, the official said, requesting anonymity. Talking about the Ganges treaty, he said the technical committee was working on finding ways of making the optimum use of the water that Bangladesh receives from India. \"During lean season, there is a serious problem of salinity intrusion in Bangladesh's south-west region. We are studying the options. It may be building barrage or dredging rivers that can help prevent salinity intrusion,\" the committee member added. The technical committee of India will study the issue in the Indian part, he added. Asked if Dhaka and Delhi were considering basin-wide management of common rivers, the expert said it was not fully basin management, but there were specific activities that are elements of basin management. Eminent water expert Dr Ainun Nishat said basin-wide river management involves management of sedimentation, sharing water and flood forecast data, checking pollution, and addressing the challenges of livelihoods of the people of the river basins. Bangladesh and India are supposed to go for such basin-wide management, but the two countries are nowhere near it. There has also been serious lack of progress on water sharing, he added. \"There were ample high-level visits between both the countries, but there's little progress. This is frustrating,\" he told The Daily Star. \"There are disputes over water sharing among the Indian states themselves. Therefore, Bangladesh, being a lower riparian country, should have the urge to address the water issues,\" said Ainun Nishat, a former member of Indo-Bangla Joint River Commission. Prof Dr Rasheduzzaman of international relations at Dhaka University said water was going to be the most important issue in the coming decades. \"It has to be looked at from the climate change point of view because the global temperature is rising. The Himalayas are melting too,\" he said. So, all the countries of this region, including China, Nepal, Bhutan, India and Bangladesh, must cooperate with each other and go for a regional management of water, Prof Rasheduzzaman added."

      "text": "What was once considered encroachment has become outright murder. But the seriousness of the crime has done little to deter a carnival of corruption plaguing river management.      Despite an intervention by the High Court, the scenario has hardly changed. In response to a public interest litigation over the slow death of the river Turag due to massive earth filling, an HC bench in early February this year ruled the waterbody be given the status of a living entity, making it a \"legal entity\". It was part of a 17-point directive by the court, which chalked out clear guidelines for saving the country's rivers and wetlands from grabbing and pollution. The directives paved the way for treating grabbing and polluting rivers as criminal offences and amending laws to empower the National River Conservation Commission as the legal guardian of all rivers. It also asked that all river grabbers be declared ineligible to contest elections and get bank loans. The HC verdict came in line with yet another landmark HC judgement in 2009 that contained a nine-point directive for river conservation.   Ten years later, however, most of the directives remain either unimplemented or implemented in a way that not only defeated the purpose of the judgement, but perhaps also harmed the rivers more. Meanwhile, due to ruthless grabbing and toxic pollution of the four Dhaka rivers, there has been an acute crisis of drinking water in the capital city. The Dhaka rivers have gotten narrower due to grabbing and hosting earth and sand filling, along with other structures. Siltation has also been a problem. According to officials and conservation activists, in a sheer mockery of the country's highest court's landmark judgement on saving four rivers around the capital Dhaka, no key directive has yet been executed meaningfully.     The most dramatic and significant example of this is how boundaries of four Dhaka rivers -- Buriganga, Shitalakhya, Turag and Balu -- have been demarcated, as it has actually legitimised further river grabbing.        The 2009 asked the authorities to demarcate the rivers after surveys, set boundary pillars, publish a list of legitimate leaseholders of river land, evict grabbers, build walkways, plant trees and dredge the rivers and their sources. Another directive was to hand over the rivers' port limits to the authority concerned. The survey was time-bound and set to be completed by November 2009. The boundary pillars and walkways had to be set up by November the following year. The apex court sin the judgement asked the relevant deputy commissioners of Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur and Munshiganj, and the land record department to demarcate the rivers according to the Cadastral Survey (CS) records and Revised Survey (RS) records, whichever would make the rivers wider, to ascertain the original position of the rivers. The DCs, however, neither followed the CS nor RS, let alone river laws, while surveying the rivers, said officials. Ironically, the four rivers were officially narrowed in the name of demarcation, with boundary pillars wrongly installed during the dry season when the flow is lean. The resurvey of the river area not only wasted public money, but extensive river foreshore area was excluded to encourage hundreds of fresh river grabbers, said officials. Such surveys had been done on different rivers at different times, but the results hardly changed. A serious flaw occurred in the process of river survey and demarcation, said Dr Muzibur Rahman Howlader, chairman of the National River Conservation Commission.  \"The DCs and Department of Land Records and Survey failed to realise the interests of the rivers and made mistakes,\" he said, adding, \"And in most cases, the river boundary has been demarcated wrongly, excluding existing river area. \"It appears the DCs and land record officials were either deficient in their knowledge of river- and land-related laws or did not have the courage to demarcate the rivers as per the law,\" he said. Revenue officials of the district administration might have randomly leased out river areas as land, and favoured influential coteries and private individuals, something the DCs could not undo while surveying the rivers, he said.   \"And the allegations of corruption in this process cannot be denied,\" he said. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, a party to the writ petition that resulted in the 2009 verdict, said, \"In most cases, the four Dhaka rivers have been wrongly demarcated, excluding inseparable river foreshores [and] actually narrowing the rivers officially.\"    The DCs and land record officials did not demarcate the rivers in accordance with how the court directed because it would expose the river grabbers. The DCs have over the years leased out river foreshores to individuals. \"So, it was a kind of 'moral duty' for them and the land record officials to save the river grabber and not the rivers,\" she said.      The entire approach was tailored to protect the land in possession of the grabbers in the name of salvaging the rivers, and river-related laws were grossly ignored in the entire process, said a BIWTA official requesting anonymity.   The classic example is the filling up of the Turag river under the very nose of half a dozen river custodians.        As the primary job of river survey was grossly flawed, the very spirit of the judgement and directions for setting up boundary pillars, building walkways and tree plantation to protect the river banks have been frustrated, they said. But where did it all go wrong?  The then DC of Narayanganj admitted to this paper that they carried out the river survey only on the basis of RS records and did not take the river foreshores into consideration. The district administration identified 3,010 illegal structures in the Shitalakhya river alone in the light of CS records, but the figure was merely 302 according to RS records and they adhered to the latter, said official sources.    As a result, Shitalakhya became narrower than what it was in the 2001 joint survey maps prepared on the basis of CS records, said an official. Since 2011, the deviation from the HC judgement was reported time and again. According to an official estimate, the Shitalakhya river alone lost 1,857 acres (nearly 81 lakhs square feet) of area including 595 acres of foreshores and the rest from the river's flowing waterway. And in the four rivers, the area lost in the process of wrong demarcation, excluding the CS line, is estimated to be roughly no less than 5,000 acres, according to officials.   In the same fashion, the Turag was mindlessly filled up with massive earth and sand filling during this decade nearly killing the river, an act that called for yet another HC judgement in February this year, giving the river the status of a \"living entity\".      Kamal Uddin Talukdar, the then DC of Gazipur, too admitted to this paper that they considered the Turag and Balu rivers' flowing waterline as river area.   The DCs and land officials ignored previous survey findings and drew the river line according to RS records which \"generously accommodated river grabbing\", said an official of BIWTA requesting anonymity. According to official correspondences, the controversial surveys were patchily completed in the four rivers by 2009 and early 2010.      Though the BIWTA initially refused to sign such arbitrary survey reports, they finally relented, albeit with objections and the reports submitted to the court. Narayanganj river port officials in 2010 wrote several times to Narayanganj DC expressing their dissatisfaction over the fact that the existing Shitalakhya river was made narrower in the process of survey but to no avail.  In 2010 and 2011, the BIWTA's Narayanganj river port officially repeatedly wrote to the Narayanganj district administration asking them not to narrow the existing Shitalakhya, and part of Buriganga and Balu rivers in the process of river survey on the basis of only RS records. In a letter to the district administration, the port officials wrote that all four Dhaka rivers would have to be demarcated in pursuance of the CS records and this was not only according to the HC verdict but also the seventh meeting of national taskforce on river conservation on 16 May, 2010. In particular, the BIWTA in the letter requested the district administration to demarcate the rivers in pursuance of the 2001 foreshore maps prepared and agreed on the previous joint survey of the district administration and BIWTA. In 2011, on the basis of ground findings following the setting up of faulty demarcation pillars submitted to the Narayanganj district administration, the BIWTA wrote that at least 2,200 of over 4,000 pillars installed in Shitalakhya and part of Buriganga and Balu rivers under jurisdiction of Narayanganj river port were installed in the flowing water of the rivers.  The action excluded an estimated 1,857 acres of existing rivers and they urged that those faulty pillars be reset 100 to 700 feet above the current position in the countryside just to save the rivers' current water flow. A port official, who then served in Narayanganj, said that the number of illegal occupants in the rivers under the Narayanganj river port area was 7,000 as per the CS records. The same number, however, was merely 700 as per RS records. The district administration followed the latter record. Similarly, the number of occupants was 4,000 as per CS records in the Buriganga under Dhaka river port, he said. It, however, was 400 as per RS records. Mohibul Haque, the then DC of Dhaka, told this paper at the time of setting up of faulty pillars, excluding river foreshores, that the river survey had many flaws.  The government is set to discard all the 9,577 river boundary pillars installed during the last one decade since the judgement on the plea that those have either been wrongly placed, or are frail, displaced or broken.   Against this backdrop, after a decade, the government has undertaken a Tk s2,300cr scheme for river conservation to reinstall 10,820 pillars all around Dhaka rivers discarding the old ones along 220 km banks of the 110-km long four rivers around Dhaka city.  The project also includes dredging 1.7 cubic metre, excavating 70 lakh cubic metre, building 52kms walkways, 19 concrete jetties, 40kms key-wall along the river banks, three eco-parks and 409 benches.     AKM Arif Uddin, BIWTA joint director and port officer of Dhaka River Port, said, \"The new pillars will be stout and have longer life.\" The river survey was done sloppily, he said, adding, for example the BIWTA officially objected to 2,198 pillars in Shitalakhya and 1,192 of a total of 4,063 in the Buriganga, Turag and Balu.   Terming the wrongly set up boundary pillars a tragedy, he said that the act of faulty demarcation encouraged hundreds of fresh grabbers to reclaim land in the flowing rivers. With a resurvey of boundary pillars in Buriganga, Turag and Balu ongoing, the new three-year project is to be completed by June 2022, he said. After a decade since the judgement of 2009, the aforementioned three-year project is by far the largest river-saving scheme that the government says it has undertaken to serve the purposes of the judgement.       But the river commission Chairman Muzibur Rahman Howlader said that they have officially written to the authorities asking them to go ahead with the expensive projects only after ensuring demarcation of the river foreshores and flood plains. The river resurvey with district administration, land records department, water development board, and BIWTA is still going on, he said. The HC verdict in February also required authorities to obtain the river commission's prior approval for implementing any river conservation project. As for the river masterplans, Howlader said that he did not know much about the river experts who were formulating those.          Among other components, the project also includes building 52km long walkway in addition to existing 22.5km, 37km river dredging, 19 concrete jetties, 40km key-wall for bank protection, forestation and three eco parks. The home minister on July 6 inaugurated setting up of the fresh boundary pillars and building walkway and key-wall at Kholamora in Kamrangirchar.  On the other hand, on July 21, the local government minister unveiled two decade-long masterplans to save the Buriganga, Turag, Balu, Dhaleswari and Pungli rivers, and the Karnaphuli and Halda rivers in Chattogram against grabbing and pollution, with the leading river conservationists knowing little about the content.   It is not all doom and gloom. Restoring rivers to their original state is possible with the existing laws. Muzibur Rahman Howlader, chairman of the river commission, said, \"The river foreshore, which is a floodplain and wetland, must be reclaimed and conserved under the wetland conservation and water laws.\" In case of four Dhaka rivers, the embankment built by the water development board is an existing official river demarcation. If for argument's sake, any one owns land on the river foreshore, none can alter the character of it because it is an integral part of river and wetland, he said, adding any structures on the foreshore is a violation of several laws-- port act, inland shipping ordinance, wetland conservation act, water act and water development board act. \"It is a must to protect the hydrological boundary of a river,\" he said. The hydrological boundary of a river is the expanse of a river's water flow to the highest mark over the flood plain of foreshores during the monsoon.       According to sections 86 and 87 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, eroded part of a land holding in the river will remain part of river. According to section 143 of the same act, deputy commissioners have the authority to cancel any private lease or ownership in the river. Besides, the Land Appeal Board is empowered by the same law (section 149/4) to undo any fraudulent or wrong land record of river area in favour of private persons, he said. None can harm the rivers, their navigable flow, water and riverine environment as the port act, inland shipping ordinance, wetland conservation act, environment conservation act, water act and the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act are all in place, said Howlader.  The commission has requested Bangladesh Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization (SPARRSO) and River Research Institute to provide technological support to find the actual length and breadth of the four rivers.  The laws applicable for saving rivers are Port Act, Port Rules of 1966, Inland Shipping Ordinance, Water Act, Wetland Conservation Act, Environment Conservation Act, State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, Land Manual."

The two Dhaka mayors have misappropriated Tk 50 crore allocated for mosquito control. Such mayors, who were utterly failure to control mosquito menace in the city, have to step down,\" JP Secretary General Moshiur Rahman Ranga said. The was addressing a human chain programme organised by the party in front of Jatiya Press Club in Dhaka around 11:00am. Mentioning that the flood-affected people in the country had to suffer for a long time this year, the JP secretary general alleged that \"the relief materials provided by the government for flood victims were insufficient and there was mismanagement in distribution of relief aids.\" \"Irregularities and indiscipline have gone beyond control in absence of the prime minister in the country,\" he added. Speaking at the programme, JP Chairman GM Quader called upon the authorities concerned to take effective measures all the year-long for preventing dengue outbreak in the country. \"The two city corporations in Dhaka have failed to take effective measures for eliminating Aedes mosquito and building awareness among people for preventing dengue. The upward trend in the number of people being infected and dying with the disease are vivid proof of the authorities' failure,\" GM Quader said. \"All the hospitals in remote areas across all the districts must be equipped with facilities for diagnosis of dengue fever and for transfusion of platelets to the patients,\" he said. Claiming Jatiya Party as the voice of the countrymen, GM Quader said, \"The people are panicked over the alarming dengue situation in the country, we cannot sit idle at a time like this.\" He also demanded that the private hospitals in the country would have to provide treatment to the dengue patients free of cost in the same way as the state-run hospitals. The situation may go beyond control if effective measures in this regard are not taken immediately, he added. JP presidium members and senior leaders were also present at the programme."

      "text": "Last Sunday, when Shahjadi Akter's five-year-old daughter began running a fever, she rushed the child to Dhaka Medical College Hospital from her Hosni Dalan house. Doctors there diagnosed her with dengue, but could not admit her due to a lack of beds. They told Shahjadi that since the infection was at an initial stage, it could be treated at home. That, however, was not the case as the situation took a turn for the worse. Five-year-old Alia's condition deteriorated and she was rushed back to DMCH around 2:00am on Friday. Again, there were no beds available. Left with little choice, Shahjadi spent the next five hours going to three different hospitals -- Mitford Hospital, Icddr,b, and Dhaka Shishu Hospital -- with her daughter in tow. Unfortunately, she got the same response. As a last-ditch effort, she took Alia to the Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital (ShSMC) around 7:00am. Doctors there were initially reluctant to take her in, but seeing Alia's blood pressure dropping fast, they finally admitted her. \"I could manage a place on the walkway of the hospital. Alia is doing better now,\" Shahjadi told The Daily Star yesterday. Alia's predicament sums up the grim picture of how medical centres in the capital are struggling to accommodate a growing number of dengue patients. This year, hospitals have seen a record number of dengue patients, unmatched in the past 18 years. A total of 10,528 people have been infected with the mosquito-borne disease till July 27. Last year, the total number was 10,148, according to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). The number of dengue patients exceeded the 10,000 mark only twice in the last 18 years: in 2018 and this year, according to a DGHS report. The previous highest was 6,232 in 2002. Meanwhile, authorities of different hospitals in the capital said at least 30 dengue patients have died so far. But the DGHS maintains that only eight have died of the disease. Explaining the disparity in the number of deaths, Prof Dr Meerjady Sa-brina Flora, director of Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) and also the head of death review committee of the government, said after a patient dies, they collect information, as well as blood samples, of the deceased to confirm the cause of the death. Only after getting all those, they can declare whether it was dengue-related or not. Director of Shishu Hospital Prof Syed Shafi Ahmed said 87 children were taking treatment in the hospital, and they were given free dengue tests and treatment to 25 to 40 patients every day at the outdoor. Around 400 patients have so far taken dengue treatment at the 664-bed hospital since March. \"Round the year we have a shortage of seats due to the large number of patients, but even then we have kept 87 seats in the hospital for dengue patients,\" he said. Shafi said they did not allow patients to stay on the floor as it was difficult to manage. HM Nazmul Ahsan, associate professor at ShSMC, said that considering the present dengue situation, they do not refuse any dengue patients despite having a capacity to handle only 60 patients. Many patients are taking treatment at the hospital's veranda and walkways, he said. In DMCH, of the 800 beds in its medicine wards, 561 were occupied by dengue patients yesterday morning. The number was around 200 last week. At least 233 dengue patients were admitted to the hospital yesterday. DENGUE-RELATED DEATHS\n In Narayanganj, a man died of dengue on July 11 in the city's Isdair. His father Kaykobad Siddiqui said his son Sawon Kabir Salehin, 38, was diagnosed with dengue on July 11 and died in Islamia Heart Centre in Narayanganj. Elsewhere, a first year student of Jahangirnagar University died of den-gue yesterday, while she was on her way to Chattogram Medical College from Cox's Bazar. The victim U Khein Nu, a first year student of Pharmacy department, hailed from Cox's Bazar. DENGUE OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL According to the DGHS, 373 people have been infected with dengue outside the capital since January. Of them, 72 are in Dhaka division, 142 in Chattogram division, 71 in Khulna division, 40 in Rajshahi division, 35 in Barishal division and 13 in Sylhet division. Most of the hospitals outside Dhaka, however, are struggling to diagnose dengue patients due to a lack of NS1 kits, which are used to do the diagnosis at the initial stage. Saiful Ferdous, deputy director of Rajshahi Medical College Hospital, said they did not have the kits, but they were using the old method to diagnose patients. Akhterul Islam, deputy director of Chattogram Medical College Hospital, said other than the blood separation machine, the hospital did not have any facility for dengue diagnosis. \"We can provide treatment to patients already diagnosed with dengue, but cannot diagnose a new patient. The tests have to be done elsewhere,\" he said. Bandarban civil surgeon Aung Shwe Prue Marma said no dengue pa-tient was detected in the district so far. Besides, the district had no laboratory for diagnosing the virus, he added.     Talking about the doctors dealing with dengue patients outside the capital, DGHS officials said the physicians did not have the NS1 kit to diagnose dengue instantly. IEDCR's Flora said they were yet to provide dengue diagnosing kits as the number of cases outside Dhaka was still comparatively very low. The NS1 antigen test (nonstructural protein 1), is a test for dengue, introduced in 2006, which allows for rapid detection of the disease on the first day of fever, as antibodies appear some five or more days later. DSCC FINES BUILDING-OWNERS FOR SPREADING INFECTION  Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) yesterday fined eight owners of under-construction buildings Tk 2.70 lakh as they found Aedes mosquito larva at the structures. The mobile court visited 78 under construction buildings and found Aedes mosquito larva in eight of them. Executive Magistrate of DSCC Mizanur Rahman said they fined them under section 269 of the penal code-1860, which has a provision for awarding six months' imprisonment and fine or both for anyone who \"unlawfully or negligently does any act which is likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life.\" DENGUE GUIDELINES ISSUED The government yesterday issued a statement to raise awareness of the steps needed to stop the spread of dengue and the measures to protect themselves from being infected by the mosquito-borne disease. Dengue peaks in the monsoon (April-October) season. Be alert during this period, a press release issued by the Press Information Department (PID) said. It further said, \"The carrier of the dengue fever, Aedes mosquito, breeds in clear water\", adding that one must not let water accumulate around their office, house or in neighbouring areas. It suggested changing accumulated water in containers every three days. \"Aedes mosquito usually bites during the day. Cover your body, as much as possible, with your clothing to protect yourself from possible mosquito bites,\" the release added. \"Use mosquito nets even while sleeping in the day time,\" it advised. Dengue-affected persons have been advised to identify it by not only the symptoms of fever, headache, muscular pain or red skin rash, as lately it has been observed that there are some exceptions, the release noted. It advised dengue patients from taking any other medicine except paracetamol. The patient should be given plenty of fluids, it said, requesting a dengue test at the first sign of a fever. It cautioned patients that even after remission of fever, one can have severe complications due to dengue. INFORMATION MINISTRY MEDIA CELL The information ministry introduced a media cell to provide necessary information to make people aware of the necessary guidelines about dengue treatment through both print and electronic media. It would also give out information regarding flood, relief and shelter and spread awareness over the recent child kidnapping rumours."

      "text": "Bangladesh should increase its investment in social sectors such as health, education and nutrition to build a healthy population and enjoy demographic dividend, said a senior official of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.    \"Investment in health gives 10 times more return and that's a conservative number,\" Mark Suzman, chief strategy officer and president of the foundation's global policy and advocacy, told The Daily Star in an interview in Dhaka recently.  Ten was the lower number and the foundation-commissioned study says the return on health is between 10 and 17 times. \"That return takes place over 25 years. And if you look over the cycle of the economy, the benefits are indisputable,\" he said, adding that the higher allocation for education and health in fiscal 2019-20's budget was encouraging. The foundation strongly believes the basic investment on health start before pregnancy, and Bangladesh still has a very extensive stunting problem. \"Stunting is extremely damaging to you because if you don't get full proper nutrition in the first two years of life and particularly in the first six months, your brain will never fully recover and develop into what it would have been otherwise.\" \"That's a huge tax on future generations and the future workforce. So, we believe it's critically important that those investments be prioritised now and then naturally the demographic dividend actually comes into being.\" Set up in 2000, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a private foundation founded by the Microsoft founder and his wife and is the largest transparently operated private foundation in the world. Based in Seattle, the foundation's total grant payments since inception was $50 billion. Last year, the total direct grantee support was $5 billion, up from $4.7 billion a year earlier according to the charitable organisation's website. Historically, it has focused on global health and health-related issues. It also focuses on areas that could have catalytic effect on poverty, such as agricultural development, access to sanitation and financial inclusion. It has been working extensively in Bangladesh for more than a decade. The areas include nutrition, agriculture research, health and financial inclusion. \"What we are doing are aligned with the priorities of the government.\" Over the last 10 years, it has provided about $250 million directly and another $100 million indirectly to Bangladesh. It works through 60 to 70 partners. It has been a long-term supporter of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B). It has a partnership with the Bangladeshi Rice Research Institute (BRRI) to help it develop more robust hybrid rice seeds that are both more drought- and flood-resistant and are often with improved food fortification. \"The ICDDR,B and the BRRI are the examples of models that we would love to be replicating in some other countries.\" In Bangladesh, it also finances a lot of the big international agencies such as the Global Alliance for Food Security and the GAVI Alliance and the Global Fund to Fight HIV, TB and malaria. It primarily provides grants as well as a combination of financial and technical support. \"It is a two-way partnership: we learn a lot from what our partners here are doing, which often can be relevant for our work in other countries.\" It has been partnering with Brac for well over a decade in multiple areas. \"We have been increasing our work steadily,\" said Suzman, who joined the foundation in 2007 as the director of global development policy, advocacy, and special initiatives. In 2012, he was appointed president of global policy, advocacy and country programmes, and in 2016 he was given an additional title: the foundation's first chief strategy officer. Bangladesh has made impressive progress over the last decade in bringing down child and maternal mortality and overall poverty rates, said Suzman, a South African national. The child mortality numbers are a big contributing factor and Bangladesh has an excellent track record in vaccine delivery. \"But even when you have progress like that, there's still more to be done.\" The foundation is a big financial supporter of the GAVI, a global vaccine alliance through which Bangladesh procures most of the standard vaccines at a much lower price. But Bangladesh's graduation into the lower middle-income bracket means it might lose the eligibility to the discounted GAVI rates. \"Bangladesh will now have to start paying a little bit more for vaccines because you're a wealthier country. It's a similar problem that a country like Vietnam is having right now.\" During the visit, Suzman met with the principal coordinator of the government on Sustainable Development Goals and the planning minister to see how the foundation's interventions can contribute to areas such as health, agriculture and nutrition, where there is potential for improvement. Bangladesh did very well and very badly in the World Bank's recent Human Capital Index, he said. The country is one of the best performers in South and East Asia and performs better than India. It showed significant improvements in investment in education and health, the two main contributing factors to human capital. On gender equity, he said there has been important progress but it is not as much as it should have been. The Gates Foundation has also some activities in the area of climate change. Bangladesh is one of the biggest victims of the changing climate and hosted the Global Commission on Adaptation meeting in Dhaka last month. The purpose of the meeting was to determine how to help the adaptation process of countries like Bangladesh that actually contributed relatively little to climate change but are disproportionately affected by the results. \"And one of the discussions I was having with the foreign minister was how we can combine our voices and the voice of the government of Bangladesh at the upcoming UN General Assembly where there is going to be a big climate summit to focus on these kinds of issues, which we feel not enough attention has been paid to.\" Unlike the Millennium Development Goals, the SDGs will have to be implemented by the respective countries. For Bangladesh, it will need $1 trillion to meet the goals, and the financing challenge is a very real one. Financing should come from three sources: the government, the private sector and international aid agencies, donors and philanthropies like the Gates Foundation. The biggest pool and the most important is the domestic resources of the country itself and how it is mobilised. Bangladesh has made some improvements but by international comparisons, it still has a relatively low percentage of the GDP captured as a sort of tax and governmental revenue. \"You're not going to be successful if that doesn't increase significantly over the next decade.\" The private sector can think about how it can contribute to achieving the SDGs through businesses directly and through corporate social responsibility indirectly. Bangladesh has put in place an SDG tracker to measure the progress in real time and check accountability. \"That's exactly the kind of model we think other countries should be following,\" said Suzman, who holds a doctorate in international relations from Oxford University and earned his bachelor's degree from Harvard University."

      "text": " When farmers were looking forward to some earnings by fishing, the Hakaluki haor in Moulvibazar has turned into a contaminated wetland with dead fish floating ashore. According to the district's fisheries department, the deaths have been caused by ammonia released by rotten weeds. The gas is replacing the oxygen dissolved in the water.  The Hakaluki haor flows over 28,000-hectare land in four upazilas of Moulvibazar and one upazila of Sylhet in north-east Bangladesh.  Sight of dead fishes lying ashore have been visible since Sunday in Gourkul, Chokia, Dholia, Nagua, Kanli, and Hawabonna swamps.   Puti, Tengra, Veda, Bailla, fries of Boal, Pabda, and Rui are among the dead fish emitting stench in the adjacent areas.  Fish is the second cash crop for farmers of Kulaura, Juri, and Barlekha upazilas of Moulvibazar.  Abdul Kadir of Bhuksimoil village of Kulaura told this paper, \"This year, I incurred losses after selling Boro paddy through middle men. I thought we will survive by catching fish from the haor. But now fish are dying just like in 2017.\"  After flashfloods in 2017, fish in the rich haor died posing health hazards. It came as a double blow for farmers as they had lost acres of paddy just weeks ahead of the annual harvest season due to flood.  \"Weeds have died and started to rot lately.  As a result, the fish are dying and the water quality is also deteriorating,\" said Moulvibazar District Fisheries Officer Emdadul Haque.  When asked what measures the authorities were taking, Sultan Mahmud, senior fisheries officer in Kulaura, said, \"We have started pouring zeolite and timsen in the haor. These substances help remove ammonia and bring temperature of water under control.\"   Abdul Karim, general secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon Sylhet chapter, said, \"At this time of the year, mother fish produce millions of fries in swamps of Hakaluki. But this time they are dying. This might lead to scarcity of fish in upcoming days.\" Besides, the haor was home to many animals, birds, and a large variety of flora and fauna, he added.  \"The water has become polluted by the rotten weed and dead fish. Usage of this water may cause skin diseases and respiratory problems,\" said Partho Sarathi Datta Kanungo, superintendent of 250-bed Moulvibazar District Hospital, asking people not to consume the water or the fish.  Marufatuzzahan, chairman of the Animal and Fish Biotechnology Department at Sylhet Agricultural University, said, \"Rotten weed could be partially responsible for increase of acid levels in the water, but studies need to be done to determine what actually cost the lives of the fish.\" "

      "text": "I was not surprised when I learned about YouTuber Raba Khan's attempt to become an author, neither was I surprised by the reactions it incited. What surprised me was how quite a few people of note jumped to blindly defending her work. I am particularly stumped by an opinion published on the Daily Star by Arafat Kazi, titled \"Defending my Bandhobi\". It's important to remember that whatever the quality of work is, bullying or harassment of any type isn't commendable. Criticisms should be constructive and restricted to the work itself. With that being said, it seems that we, as readers, are not allowed to express how we feel about what we read. I was under the impression that once a piece of creative content is released for public consumption, it opens itself up to praise, criticism, and everything in between. If I'm able to talk about why I like a certain thing, I should also be able to talk about why I do not like it. Apparently, being a teenage fan of Raba Khan somehow makes that person immediately unqualified to criticize a piece of literary work. What qualifications must we attain to be able to review this work? Am I only allowed to share what I think after getting a bachelor's degree in literature? Or a PhD, perhaps? The op-ed uses examples of Rabindranath Tagore and William Shakespeare, both of whom revolutionized the language they spoke. Supposedly, Khan is following into their footsteps by reflecting how our usage of language has evolved over time. While we're at it, let's note that both Barack Obama and Donald Trump speak the same language. There is eloquence, then there is incoherence. My interpretation of Masnoon Khair's meme with the caption \"Thakur and Shakespeare review Raba Khan's latest book, visibly shocked at the massacre of two different languages\" was that it pointed out how both of these languages failed to make sense - not that they were used together. Some critics did believe her usage of two languages (three, if you count the occasional Hindi in the book \"Bandhobi\") crossed a line. Yes, this reaction is quite puritan. I agree with Kazi that language belongs to its users, and it evolves over time. Khan can write in whatever language(s) she wishes to. Most bilingual writers use words, phrases, even sentences from another language. Salman Rushdie, Arundhati Roy, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Tahmima Anam are a few writers of South Asian origin who have masterfully accomplished this. The article also brings up examples of negative reactions to cultural innovations in Bangladesh that have stood the test of time. Let's give Raba Khan the same test and see if the quality of her work can withstand it, shall we? However, this point of contention is so trivial that making this about our national insecurities appears to be a ridiculous overstretch. Speaking of ridiculous overstretches, Raba Khan is then compared with Jane Austen. I'm not entirely sure how anyone who has read Jane Austen and hopefully some other stellar literary works can possibly connect them with Khan's book. But then an answer to my query is ready with an infallible logic: \"Like Austen, Khan is a woman, writing about issues of traditional femininity.\" This comparison was so mind-boggling that I don't have anything to say to refute it - the same way I wouldn't be able to say anything if someone compared a speedbreaker to the Himalayas. Both a speedbreaker and the Himalayas are elevated planes, but the similarity ends there. Khan's comic timing is praised but the quality of her prose is brushed over. Here lies the core of the problem: despite numerous attempts, even the staunchest defender couldn't ignore that the written form did not work well enough for the comedian. She should not be barred from venturing outside of comedy or into the literary world, but we, as her audience, also reserve the right to criticize her work when done poorly just as we praise it when done excellently. Why should one defend her writing just because she is a successful comedian? Does being good at one thing immediately give us a license to get celebrated for producing lackluster work in any other domain? The opinion piece repeatedly highlights puritan gatekeepers and pays little attention to valid criticisms of Khan's work - but this does not bode well for anyone, certainly not for Khan herself. There is nothing wrong with accepting reasonable feedback and using it to improve your work. She is welcome to experiment, but she should do so with her eyes open. This entire debacle should serve as a learning opportunity. We are told to celebrate Khan's accomplishment of entertaining millions, and while telling us to do so, Kazi takes a jab at our content ecosystem that is filled with unoriginal content and not-so-great comedians. It's hilarious because everytime someone attempts to criticize the quality of these content-makers, outcries of \"At least they're doing something! How dare you criticize someone for doing something?\" are heard. Ironically, this is the exact defense used for Khan's book. As a member of the audience who did not like \"Bandhobi\", I can tell you that it's not because of her gender or due to her not being a part of the establishment. Readers like books that are well-written, they don't like books simply because they were written by a celebrity. The reason for people not liking this book is not that she thinks she can do everything, it's because she doesn't do things as great as she thinks she does. Our inability to be open to any sort of criticism to creative work and blindly praising anyone who has tried anything has allowed sub-par content to flood all creative channels in Bangladesh: be it books, TV, YouTube videos or movies. There are many talented people out there, let's open the floor for them and publicize quality content instead of defending things that are better left alone. We need to stop excusing and celebrating mediocrity. Moneeesha R Kalamder is the Editor-in-Chief of Rantages. Reach her at mkalamder9.75@gmail.com"

      "text": "From a hero on the big screen to a hero advocating road safety, Ilias Kanchan's fight to ensure safer roads for the public began after the death of his wife Jahanara Kanchan in a road accident on October 22, 1993, a day which finally gained recognition as National Road Safety Day in 2017, much to the credit of Kanchan's relentless campaign. What began out of a personal loss of a loved one, over time matured into a global movement under the banner Nirapad Sarak Chai (Nischa). With branches all across Bangladesh and in USA, UK, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, Kanchan spearheads the organisation for the sole purpose of implementing road safety for all, since its formation on December 1, 1993. He believes that the Road Transport Act 2018 which came into effect from this month is on par with his crusade. \"At the time of my wife's demise, people's perception about road accidents was rather naive. They thought that it was meant to be, so it happened. But I differed. After much effort, that perception began to change. Even more so since United Nations proclaimed the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020. The lack of knowledge among the general people about traffic rules/practices, the absence of institutional training of vehicle drivers, the widespread use of unfit vehicles and the lack of scientific planning behind the construction of the roads, among others, collectively contributed to road crashes. Therefore, it was evident that such casualties were man-made and thus preventable. By then, the government took notice and improvements were in the offing. \"Many of the crashes resulted from head-on collision and speeding on the highways. Strict traffic rules were of utmost necessity. We began by suggesting one-way roads on the highways, use of dividers, formation of highway traffic police force, and many other corrective measures. Of them, we stressed heavily on the proper institutional training of drivers. We also emphasised on the issue that unless the drivers are penalised strictly, they will treat the meagre fines as a slap on the wrist and continue to drive or even worse, race, recklessly, putting countless lives at risk. \"By 2012, there was a draft for a new law on traffic but unfortunately it was omitted. In 2016, yet another draft was prepared with the hope that the government would consider it. Later, with the student uprising demanding road safety last year, in the spur of the moment, a new bill was passed. However, it was opposed by many from the transport sector. Finally, with the prime minister's approval, the bill has seen the light of day. \"Nischa continues to operate at multiple social spheres of the society, including schools, universities and madrasas, creating awareness about road safety. We also provide free training to people from underprivileged backgrounds to help them sustain a livelihood through proper driving.    \"I firmly believe that once the law is taken into full consideration and everyone begins to abide by it, there will be considerable improvements in the overall traffic system of our country and hopefully one day our roads will lead every citizen home safe and sound.\" Interviewed by Minam Haque\nRajib Hossain lost his hand between two racing buses in Dhaka on April 3, 2018. He later succumbed to his injuries. \n\"When a member of a family is gone, they are gone forever. And those who are left behind are left to feel their absence forever\"    -Rajib Hossain's aunt, Ms Jahanara\nOn April 3, 2018, Rajib Hossain lost his hand between two racing buses in Dhaka. On April 17, he passed away after succumbing to his injury. Rajib's two brothers, both in their teens, have no immediate family left to take care of them. Rajib's maternal aunt, Ms Jahanara, says they often mention their elder brother, who used to take care of them, and tell her how much they miss him.\n\"I go to pick them up from their exams, they say if Rajib was still here, he would have picked them up himself. They are still very upset; they still cry often. They don't have any parents or many relatives. Rajib grew up in my house. I thought once he grew up, he would take care of his brothers. The media has given a lot of coverage to Rajib's story. But nothing has happened--and a day will come when people will stop talking about Rajib. But those close to him will always miss him, their pain will never go away.\n\"This is what people never realise. When a member of a family is gone, they are gone forever. And those who are left behind are left to feel their absence forever. Rajib would buy pencils and other stationary for his brothers.\nNo matter what the government says, nothing is being done. Reckless driving continues to take lives every day. If the government took proper action, maybe more families could be spared the pain of losing their loved ones.\nDespite all the talk about compensation, we have not received anything at all. Where is the justice? There is no justice.\nThe court ordered the bus companies to pay Tk one crore as compensation. There is an ongoing court case on that. The court then ordered them to pay Tk 10 lakh within 30 days. Still we have received nothing. People often ask us how much money we have been given. That's all they talk about. But the truth is, the bus companies haven't had to give up anything.\nThe companies didn't even act according to the court's ruling. If they can ignore the courts, who are the people supposed to turn to? Where will the people go? Who do they have to help them, to support them, and where will they go to get justice?\nHad one or two of these reckless drivers and bus companies been punished, hundred more would have fallen in line and refrained from acting in this dismal manner. But no one ever gets punished, and that simply encourages more tragedies to happen. When will this stop? The media continues to cover one such story after another. And soon, one victim's face is replaced by another, until one after the other keeps being forgotten.\nBut if you want the truth about what happened, all you have to do is look at the faces of Rajib's brothers. They have not forgotten him. And their faces tell more than anyone can ever comprehend--about pain, loss and suffering.     I still cannot look at Rajib's image without breaking down in tears. We all miss him so much, the pain and loss that we feel cannot be explained in mere words.\"\nInterviewed by Eresh Omar Jamal\n \n\"If the law is applied only for the bus drivers but not a lawmaker's son, then nothing will change\"\n-Asif Munier\nAsif Munier, younger brother of Mishuk Munier and also a rights and cultural activist, development professional on migration and displacement issues, talks to The Daily Star about the issues that should be addressed for properly enforcing the Road Safety Act, 2018.\n\"I feel that passing a law such as the road safety act is just one step in ensuring safe roads. This law cannot have an impact on the ground without an overall systemic change. We must have a mechanism in place so that the law can be enforced properly. There are two aspects of enforcement. One, whether people are abiding by the law, and two, if the government is properly enforcing the law. Obviously, the responsibility of the state mechanism is more important, but the general people also have to play their due role.\n\"We must feel that this is our country and anything that is harming the country is, in fact, harming us. Thus, we must play our own part to make the law effective.\n\"Last year, during the road safety movement, the schoolchildren set an example that law can be applied to all. They stopped everybody, irrespective of their identity, and checked their licenses and related papers. Our police must also do so. They must take action against anyone who is violating the traffic rules. If there is a need, we can have separate lanes for the VIPs, the ambulances and emergency services. But the police should not allow the \"VIPs\" to drive on the wrong side of the road.\n\"Many ride sharing transport and CNG-run three-wheeler drivers expressed their fear that the new law might be misused by the police. I came to know about their fear while travelling by the ride sharing services. According to them, the police might now demand more money from the drivers against whom a case is filed for violating the law. Say, for example, if a driver is fined Tk 10,000, the traffic police might demand Tk 5,000 to withdraw the case against him.\n\"Through giving the police a proper pay-scale as well as ensuring discipline and accountability in the force, corruption can be checked, which is needed to enforce the road safety law as well as many other laws.\n\"When the court sentenced the driver to life imprisonment for his reckless driving that killed Tareque Masud, Mishuk Munier and three others in 2017, the whole country came to a standstill because of the strikes enforced by the transport workers and owners. Why are these people so powerful? Is it because they have connection with the top brass of our society and perhaps even the lawmakers? If we cannot break the syndicate of the transport workers and transport owners, this law will not help.\n\"Speaking of reckless driving, it is not only the drivers of the public transports who do are to blame, it is often the children of the rich people who drive recklessly. I live in Banani; on New Year's eve, I often see children of the rich people driving recklessly and speeding. So, the law has to be applicable for everyone. If the law is applied only for the bus drivers but not a lawmaker's son, then nothing will change.\n\"Apart from law enforcement, what is important is governance. Bangladesh has formulated many good laws and ratified many international conventions. But when it comes to implementing these conventions or laws, we seem very weak, because we do not bring the laws under a system for implementation. And that happens for lack of a strong political will on the part of the government.\n\"Moreover, the independence of the judiciary is a must. Without having an independent judiciary, we cannot change anything. No matter how many laws we formulate, we will not be able to enforce them, if those with money and power can get bail or manipulate the law in their favour.\n\"We must make sure that the law is applied to all and we must have trust in the law.\"\n \nInterviewed by Naznin Tithi\nMishuk Munier, a cinematographer and media personality, along with renowned filmmaker Tareque Masud and three of their film production crew died in a fatal road crash on the Dhaka-Aricha highway in Ghior upazila of Manikganj on August 13, 2011.

We are reprinting experts from her interview on the occasion of World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims.\n\"Our struggle for justice in the compensation case against the bus driver, bus companies and insurers who were directly and indirectly responsible for the crash was a long and difficult one. When the verdict was handed down in December 2017, we were tremendously relieved that it had gone in our favour. However, we were disappointed that the insurance company was let off with so little liability.\n\"While the government is to be commended for its attempt to revise some of the outdated aspects of the earlier road transport legislation, with respect to the issue of compensation, the 2018 Act actually represents a step backward. The Motor Vehicle Ordinance 1983, under which we filed our High Court case, contained a provision for suing for compensation from not only drivers but also the transport company owners and insurers. This provision for compensation on the basis of vicarious liability is a standard one in many countries around the world, and is a fundamental necessity for ensuring accountability of those at the apex of the transport sector who are ultimately responsible for the negligence and misconduct of the vehicles they own or insure and the employees that drive them.\n\"Only when transport owners and insurers are made financially liable will lasting positive change come to this sector, as they will be motivated out of self-interest to make sure that vehicles meet safety standards, drivers are properly trained, licensed and paid, and traffic rules are enforced and obeyed.\n\"But the 2018 Act removes the right of the victims of road crashes to sue for compensation from transport owners and insurers. Possibly it is the powerful lobby groups for these interests who ensured that this provision was dropped from the new Act, out of fear that the precedent set by our case would lead to a flood of similar cases.  \n\"In place of this provision, which should be a fundamental right, the new Act provides for a mechanism of monetary assistance through a vaguely defined \"Financial Aid Fund\", whose name implies charitable support to victims rather than true compensation for their losses and suffering. Although such a Fund may play an important role in providing more immediate, interim relief to victims of road crashes and their families, it can by no means replace a mechanism of legal compensation, but rather can play an important supplementary role. So with the Road Transport Act of 2018, the owners and insurers have been let off the hook, and they can proceed to operate with impunity as many thousands of lives continue to be lost every year.\"\n On April 3, 2018, Rajib Hossain lost his hand between two racing buses in Dhaka.

Although such a Fund may play an important role in providing more immediate, interim relief to victims of road crashes and their families, it can by no means replace a mechanism of legal compensation, but rather can play an important supplementary role. So with the Road Transport Act of 2018, the owners and insurers have been let off the hook, and they can proceed to operate with impunity as many thousands of lives continue to be lost every year.\"\n   Asif Munier, younger brother of Mishuk Munier and also a rights and cultural activist, development professional on migration and displacement issues, talks to The Daily Star about the issues that should be addressed for properly enforcing the Road Safety Act, 2018. \"I feel that passing a law such as the road safety act is just one step in ensuring safe roads. This law cannot have an impact on the ground without an overall systemic change. We must have a mechanism in place so that the law can be enforced properly. There are two aspects of enforcement. One, whether people are abiding by the law, and two, if the government is properly enforcing the law. Obviously, the responsibility of the state mechanism is more important, but the general people also have to play their due role. \"We must feel that this is our country and anything that is harming the country is, in fact, harming us. Thus, we must play our own part to make the law effective. \"Last year, during the road safety movement, the schoolchildren set an example that law can be applied to all. They stopped everybody, irrespective of their identity, and checked their licenses and related papers. Our police must also do so. They must take action against anyone who is violating the traffic rules. If there is a need, we can have separate lanes for the VIPs, the ambulances and emergency services. But the police should not allow the \"VIPs\" to drive on the wrong side of the road. \"Many ride sharing transport and CNG-run three-wheeler drivers expressed their fear that the new law might be misused by the police. I came to know about their fear while travelling by the ride sharing services. According to them, the police might now demand more money from the drivers against whom a case is filed for violating the law. Say, for example, if a driver is fined Tk 10,000, the traffic police might demand Tk 5,000 to withdraw the case against him. \"Through giving the police a proper pay-scale as well as ensuring discipline and accountability in the force, corruption can be checked, which is needed to enforce the road safety law as well as many other laws. \"When the court sentenced the driver to life imprisonment for his reckless driving that killed Tareque Masud, Mishuk Munier and three others in 2017, the whole country came to a standstill because of the strikes enforced by the transport workers and owners. Why are these people so powerful? Is it because they have connection with the top brass of our society and perhaps even the lawmakers? If we cannot break the syndicate of the transport workers and transport owners, this law will not help. \"Speaking of reckless driving, it is not only the drivers of the public transports who do are to blame, it is often the children of the rich people who drive recklessly. I live in Banani; on New Year's eve, I often see children of the rich people driving recklessly and speeding. So, the law has to be applicable for everyone. If the law is applied only for the bus drivers but not a lawmaker's son, then nothing will change. \"Apart from law enforcement, what is important is governance. Bangladesh has formulated many good laws and ratified many international conventions. But when it comes to implementing these conventions or laws, we seem very weak, because we do not bring the laws under a system for implementation. And that happens for lack of a strong political will on the part of the government. \"Moreover, the independence of the judiciary is a must. Without having an independent judiciary, we cannot change anything. No matter how many laws we formulate, we will not be able to enforce them, if those with money and power can get bail or manipulate the law in their favour. \"We must make sure that the law is applied to all and we must have trust in the law.\"   Interviewed by Naznin Tithi In October 2018, noted filmmaker Catherine Masud talked to Nahela Nowshin about her own journey of navigating the justice system and the shortcomings of the recently passed Road Transport Act 2018. We are reprinting experts from her interview on the occasion of World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. \"Our struggle for justice in the compensation case against the bus driver, bus companies and insurers who were directly and indirectly responsible for the crash was a long and difficult one. When the verdict was handed down in December 2017, we were tremendously relieved that it had gone in our favour. However, we were disappointed that the insurance company was let off with so little liability. \"While the government is to be commended for its attempt to revise some of the outdated aspects of the earlier road transport legislation, with respect to the issue of compensation, the 2018 Act actually represents a step backward. The Motor Vehicle Ordinance 1983, under which we filed our High Court case, contained a provision for suing for compensation from not only drivers but also the transport company owners and insurers. This provision for compensation on the basis of vicarious liability is a standard one in many countries around the world, and is a fundamental necessity for ensuring accountability of those at the apex of the transport sector who are ultimately responsible for the negligence and misconduct of the vehicles they own or insure and the employees that drive them. \"Only when transport owners and insurers are made financially liable will lasting positive change come to this sector, as they will be motivated out of self-interest to make sure that vehicles meet safety standards, drivers are properly trained, licensed and paid, and traffic rules are enforced and obeyed. \"But the 2018 Act removes the right of the victims of road crashes to sue for compensation from transport owners and insurers.

      "text": "People formed a human chain in front of a vulnerable cyclone shelter on the Ramnabad river bank in Chalitabunia union under Rangabali upazila on Wednesday demanding immediate steps to save their dwellings, agricultural lands and different set-ups in the area. Patuakhali Youth Forum arranged the programme with the cooperation of UNICEF marking the 'climate strike week', being observed in over 150 countries across the globe from September 20 to 27 to step up support for young climate strikers demanding an end to the age of fossil fuels. Chalitabunia is an isolated union, surrounded by the Agunmukha river in the North and East and the Ramnabad river in the South and West, and the locals are under fear as the Agunmukha has caused serious erosion since 2013, speakers said at the human chain. \"Over 200 homesteads and about 300 acres of land went into the river in last five years. The river recently devoured two mosques and a madrasa and the only cyclone shelter for Chalitabunia, Bibirhawla, Gorurdanga and Golbunia villages is about to collapse,\" said Zahidur Rahman, chairman of Chalitabunia union parishad. At least 6,000 people living beside the river are passing days amid fear as their dwellings and farmlands are under threat, he said. Saline water with tidal surges easily enters into agricultural lands through damaged portions of flood control embankment on the river, said local farmers. Md Jahirul Islam, president of Patuakhali Youth Forum, Khalid Bin Walid Talukder, vice chairman of Rangabali upazila parishad, Jahangir Alam, headmaster of Mamotajuddin High School, Lipi Akhter, union parishad member, addressed the gathering, among others. They demanded effective steps to save dwelling houses, farmlands, cyclone shelter and other establishments from erosion. During a recent visit to the area, this correspondent found the cyclone shelter set up by Red Crescent at risk due to removal of earth from near its pillars. During the high tide, the structure seems to be standing inside the river. Md Mohsin Hawlader, 60, a local fisherman, said his house at Chalitabunia village went into the river one and a half years ago. Delwar Biswas, a farmer of the same village, said he cannot grow crops well as saline water enters through the damaged portion of flood control embankment. Khan Md Waliuzzaman, executive engineer of Water Development Board in Kalapara Circle, said there are 27 kilometres of flood control embankment around Chalitabunia union and of it at least four km area has been eroded by the river. \"We are making an estimate to repair the damaged dyke for sending to the higher authorities. We hope the repair work will start in the upcoming dry season,\" he said."

Responding to a query after attending the last session of the DCs conference at the Secretariat in the capital yesterday, ACC Chairman Iqbal Mahmud said it will not be considered as crime if any government official commits any major mistakes driven by 'good faith'. \"It is clear to everyone that doing something in good faith is not a crime. Even if it is something big (corruption), it also should not be considered as criminal offence,\" he said. \"It is mentioned in the Penal Code that anything done in good faith cannot be termed a crime. It is called general exception,\" Iqbal Maumud also said. Rejection the ACC chief's remark, Quader, also the minister for Road Transport and Bridges, said, \"Corruption is corruption and the government will consider it accordingly.\" Responding to another query about BNP's allegation that the government is hindering the party from carrying out its organisational activities, Quader ruled out the allegation and said, \"It is nothing but a fictious comment.\" About the government's relief work for the flood victims across the country, Quader said, \"Our party's relief-work teams have already stood beside the flood victims while the government is dealing with the issue sincerely.\" When asked about the future of Jatiya Party, Quader said the JP has secured victory in a number of parliamentary constituencies in the December 30 national election and emerged as a main opposition party in the parliament. Those parties which take decisions in timely and fitting manner will survive in politics, the Awami League leader added."

He also said the government will give 20 per cent incentive on rice export, according to a press release of the ministry. The minister said this at an inter-ministerial meeting on steps taken to ensure fair price of rice to the farmers today at Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council conference room. Mentioning that the agricultural sector is making significant contribution to the country's economy, Minister Abdur Razzak said the farmers will be benefitted if the rice could be procured from them directly. \"The farmers cultivate rice through a lot of hard work and sacrifices. We cannot let it happen that the farmers are deprived of fair price for their output,\" he said. \"Although the price of rice is low in the world market at the moment, still we have to go for rice export. If necessary, we would buy the rice from the farmers directly and then sell it at a low price to the country's poor people,\" the minister also said. \"The government is prepared to prevent any untoward situation over rice price in the next season,\" he said. He stressed that the cost of production has to be lowered in order to make agriculture a profitable venture. The government would provide the farmers with the necessary equipment for planting and harvesting rice, Minister Abdur Razzak added. Speaking at the meeting, Food Minister Sadhan Chandra Majumder said 40 lakh tonnes of rice was imported during the 2017 flood in Haor areas, which still remains in the market and hence influenced the rice price in this year's Boro season. He also suggested to stop giving incentive to Aus paddy cultivation. \"The government is taking steps for permanent solution to save the farmers. A total of 162 food storehouses of capacity 7-8 lakh tonnes will be built across the country,\" the minister said. He also mentioned that the Ministry of Commerce has given approval for exporting 41,000 tonnes of rice. The minister also stressed for implementing more effective technology for the development of the agriculture sector."

Dramatic footage aired on local TV stations and posted on social media showed vehicles submerged on roads near major landmarks like the Washington Monument, and some motorists standing on the roofs of their cars as the floodwaters rose. One such video showed water gushing down through a hole in the roof of a Washington metro station. The main power vault of the National Archives building -- which houses some of the most important documents in American history -- was flooded, cutting power as the streets around it were submerged. \"The building's flood walls deployed and worked,\" the institution said in a statement. \"The Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights -- along with all of the permanently valuable records stored in the building -- are safe and not in any danger.\" The White House was not spared either: Footage posted by several correspondents and outlets showed puddles forming in one of its basements. Emergency services said they received dozens of calls from citizens seeking help. Despite the widespread flooding, no deaths were reported. The rainfall and floodwaters subsided later in the day, as damage assessments began in the District of Columbia -- where Washington is located -- and neighboring parts of Virginia and Maryland. Hundreds of customers were affected by power outages because of the rainfall, according to a live map on the website of local utility Pepco. \"Stay clear of downed power lines and always assume they are energized,\" it said in a tweet."

      "text": "Every year on February 2, nations have been celebrating the World Wetlands Day since 1997. But unfortunately, despite national and international efforts, wetlands are still treated as revenue-generating machines or wastelands in many countries including Bangladesh. Apparently, nobody would like to think of wetlands as a natural solution in adapting to the global climate change. Many people don't even bother to think that these ecosystems play a significant role in mitigating the adverse impacts of climatic change. Hence, many wetlands have already been encroached, degraded or polluted. The theme of this year's Wetlands Day is \"Wetlands and Climate Change\"--and it has been chosen to highlight the important role played by wetlands, as a natural solution, in terms of adapting to and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Many developing and developed countries as well as their economies and natural ecosystems have been battling with an unprecedented degree of climatic change in recent years. Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP), prepared in 2008 and revised in 2009, identified that water security, food security, energy security, health security and livelihood security are being threatened by the adverse impacts of climate change. As one of the lead authors of BCCSAP, I know that many of the 45 programmes included in this plan couldn't be implemented because of resource constraints, deficits in programme preparations and planning problems. This is quite unfortunate. It should be noted that wetland ecosystems are severely affected, for example, by sea-level rise, coral bleaching, hydrological effects, changes in water temperature, and alterations in water availability and quality. Wetlands in Bangladesh, like in many other developing countries, are particularly affected by socio-economic pressures and the climate change, which result in the degradation of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and a concomitant negative impact on human communities, especially those on the coast. The adverse impacts of climate change are particularly significant in our country and will decrease ecosystem resilience. Different reports suggest that around 90 percent of the wetlands, hosting more than 70,000 water birds, are in the coastal region and under threat of submersion following a sea-level rise. Many of our coastal, haor, dry and upland regions are likely to lose large numbers of wetland species as a result of climate change. Wetlands, particularly coastal and haor wetlands, are important in the process to mitigate climate change because they help to manage extreme weather events through the multiple services that they provide. Important wetland functions include water storage, groundwater recharge, storm protection, flood mitigation, shoreline stabilisation, erosion control, and retention of carbon, nutrients, sediments and pollutants (Dugan 1990).  Experts say that wetlands are also significant carbon stores. According to the Ramsar Convention, it has been estimated that peatlands contain at least 550 Gt of carbon, which is almost double the amount stored in the world's forests. Although they cover only 3 percent of the world's landmass, they contain 30 percent of its soil carbon (Parish et al, 2008; FAO, 2012b). Wetlands such as mangroves like The Sundarbans, saltmarshes, haors and coral reefs play crucial roles in controlling flood peaks and spreading the water table. Thanks to their vegetation, such as trees and root mats, wetlands act as permeable barriers that slow waves, reduce flooding, and offer natural protection for coastlines against destructive weather events. Wetlands are an important source of water everywhere, including in places where resources are scarce. Local populations and animal and plant species benefit from wetlands as providers of water. Wetlands allow water to reach the underground water table, making the resource available in dry periods. Thus, wetlands are key for groundwater recharge and allow ecosystems to cope with drought in places like Barind Track. By the same process, by releasing underground water, wetlands help to maintain the flow of rivers when precipitations diminish. These enormously valuable natural bodies also offer solid evidence that investing in natural solutions is a cost-effective way to enhance resilience to climate change in vulnerable coastal areas and communities. But with the degradation or encroachment of wetlands, human well-being is being compromised. It is raising the risk of flooding of houses and infrastructure, and increasing the risk of exposure to water shortages and drought. Against these threats, initiatives to conserve wetlands can make a difference and benefit the well-being of the future generations of people and wildlife. I think our policymakers should help raise public awareness of the importance of wetlands. They should ensure stakeholder participation in wetland management to maintain human well-being including livelihood. Strengthening national legal and policy arrangements to conserve all wetlands is an urgent task and that should be an integral part of Bangladesh's National Adaptation Plan (NAP) which should be prepared without any further delay. I would also suggest developing and implementing NAP as per the NAP Roadmap prepared in 2015 and it should be our high priority along with revisiting Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. Coastal, haor and unprotected wetlands are expected to be most severely impacted by climate change, but conserving and restoring the wetlands is an effective way to mitigate climate change impacts for people and biodiversity. Revisiting the Delta Plan is essential before it enters its implementation phase to ensure people's participation in the formulation and implementation of this long-term plan, with more adequate public consultations.

      "text": "Cultivation of kans grass (called kash phool in Bangla) serves as a modest earning source for many people, especially those in different char (sandy riverbank) areas of the district. After recession of the floodwater every year, kash seeds naturally germinate in the vast tracts of char areas in different upazilas of the district. In October every year, its white flower-stalks keep waving even in a gentle breeze and create a charming atmosphere along the river banks as well as the char lands. Usually, month of January and February are the trading months of kans grass straws. After harvesting the kans grass in the month of November, farmers pile up the kans grass along the river banks or in the open char lands for drying up. Later, they prepare bundles of the dried up kans straws. Usually, length of a healthy straw is around eight to ten feet. Farmer Abdul Mannan, 40, of Porarchar village under Jatrapur union in Kurigram Sadar upazila, said, \"The area of kans cultivation is not fixed as it depends on flood.\" Rustam Ali, 54, of Char Shitayejhar village under Mogalbasha union in the upazila, said after harvesting kans in the month of November many farmers go for cultivation of Boro or other Robi crops. They sell each small bundle of kans straw for Tk 3 to Tk 5 to the buyers, who come from across the country. During a visit to Mogalbasha union this correspondent saw some labourers busy preparing kans straw bundles. \"Preparing kans straw bundles is a seasonal work and I have been involved with it for nearly eight years now,\" said day labourer Noor Mohammad, 55. Usually, we prepare a large bundle of dried kash straw with 10 small bundles, consisting 10 straws, he said, adding that they get Tk 400 for 100 large bundles. Kans trader Nayebar Ali, 58, said, the business lasts for four months from November. After preparing the straw bundles farmers keep those on the river banks and traders go there by boats to purchase the item, he said, adding that they buy one thousand of small bundles for Tk 3,000 to Tk 5,000. They take the kans bundles to other districts like Rajshahi, Khulna and Barisal and sell each thousand of small bundles for Tk 6,000 to Tk 7,000 to the local traders. In the peak season, at least seven to eight trucks of kans straws are sold at Mogalbasha Haat every week,\" Nayebar said.  Sadar Upazila Agriculture Officer Shashthy Chandra Roy said for the char farmers kans grass is a natural crop, which is grown without any investment or labour."

      "text": "The Indo-Pacific region is one of the most dynamic regions of the world. It is a region, which is situated at the strategic crossroads, where genuine opportunities meet actual challenges. The region is experiencing unique economic growth for decades. On the one hand, the economic growth of the region opens up opportunities of partnership to alleviate poverty and raise living standards of billions of people. On the other hand, the growth of material powers of the countries, i.e. economic and military powers - require avoiding deepening suspicion and mistrust amongst each other. In fact, it is the time to build 'Strategic Trust' in the region, that is - belief and cooperation between countries to minimise divergences, on the way to building peace and stability in the region. In doing so, mutual understanding and developing trust between Armed Forces in general and Land Forces in particular of this region can be an important determinant. Developing trust among land forces especially those sharing a common international boundary is perhaps easier in theory than in practice due to a host of reasons -- border disputes, presence of non-state actors, transnational crimes, criminal activities, etc. Absence of cooperation or sharing information can breed social disorder, violence and also terrorism that would not be limited to any specific country but may affect the entire region. Therefore, it is essential that we reduce divergence and build trust amongst our nations. I had the unique opportunity to experience such issues for almost four years being the Director General of Border Guard Bangladesh. General Aziz Ahmed, Chief of Army Staff, Bangladesh Army, speaks at the Indo-Pacific Armies Chiefs Conference in Bangkok, Thailand yesterday.\n All dimensions of security, whether politico-military, environmental or human are interlinked. In the 21st Century, the major threats -- be it traditional or non-traditional -- do not discriminate or recognise borders. No nation can meet these challenges alone. Military, being one of the core instruments of national power, has a vital role in ensuring the security of our nations. We cannot achieve it through the application of combat power against each other; instead, we can deliver it through collaboration, sharing knowledge and expertise, and understanding each other. Our constitution based foreign policy states that Bangladesh shall determine its international relations on the principles of respect for national sovereignty and equality, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for international norms, and the principles stated in the United Nations Charter. After our independence in 1971, the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman said: 'We want friendship to all and malice towards none'. This ideology laid the foundation of our foreign relations, and Bangladesh is still pursuing this in letter and spirit. \n BORDERS WITH INDIA AND MYANMAR\n Bangladesh has a total of 4,427 km of land and river boundary with its two neighbours: India and Myanmar. The lion's share of our border is with India, which is about 94 per cent. The remaining 271 km border with Myanmar runs along the River Naaf for 63 km and then through the hilly terrain for 208 km.  RESOLUTION OF BORDER ISSUES WITH INDIA India and Bangladesh had three border-related issues: enclaves, adverse possession of territory and a small stretch of 6.5 km un-demarcated boundary. India and Bangladesh signed the 1974 Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) to resolve outstanding issues. This Agreement was amended in 2011 by an additional Protocol. The LBA entered into force on June 6, 2015. India had 111 enclaves within Bangladesh, and Bangladesh had 51 enclaves in India. Under the terms of the LBA, both the countries transferred these enclaves. The inhabitants of the enclaves were given the right to remain on the territories as nationals of the State to which the territories were transferred. Adverse possession, as the name suggests--is a piece of land that belongs to one country but is in the control of another country. Both Bangladesh and India had more than 3,000 acres of land each as adverse possession which was exchanged amicably.  There was 6.5 km un-demarcated border with India of which, 4.5 km border has already been settled, and the remaining 2 km will be resolved soon. Implementation of the LBA has given the people living in the enclaves access to the essential services which were unavailable for more than 60 years due to the isolated nature of the territories. Implementation of the LBA also demonstrates how States can resolve issues with mutual respect yet maintain their national interest. \n CHALLENGES OF BORDER MANAGEMENT\n There are, of course, challenges associated with border management. Our border being porous poses many problems for the border guarding forces. Border areas are socio-economically underdeveloped, and dwellers of bordering regions generally do not have required education and economic opportunities, which at times entice them to get involved in informal trade, violating state rules and regulations. There are insurgent groups in neighbouring countries operating close to our border that may take advantage of the porous and inaccessible border and may attempt to cross the border unnoticed whenever they are targeted and chased. They are causing political disturbances in their home country and may also create strained relation between neighbours. Bangladesh is located at the heart of three drug-producing regions: in the east, the Golden Triangle, in the north, the Golden Wedge and in the west, across India, the Golden Crescent. The proximity of these regions is a significant factor that makes Bangladesh vulnerable to drug trafficking. Recently 'Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals' have found to be involved in drug trafficking. Being in the midst of the Golden Triangle, the Golden Wedge and the Golden Crescent, Bangladesh is vulnerable to be used as a transit route by transnational militant and insurgent outfits for smuggling arms and ammunition. Human trafficking is a global problem, and Bangladesh is no exception to this. Illegal trafficking of mostly women and children across the border is causing social problem and insecurity. Women and children of the 'Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals' are potential targets of human traffickers. Smuggling is the most common issue for the border guards. A considerable quantity of products mainly cattle, clothes, etc. are smuggled from India and Myanmar to Bangladesh through various routes. Another high value smuggled item is gold, which is used as a means of payment of informal trade. Circulation of fake currency by transnational criminals through bordering areas is another concern which contributes to inflation.  REDUCTION OF MISCALCULATION/CONFLICTS \n There are several ways to reduce miscalculation and avert conflicts. The important ones deserve attention. Respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity of bordering countries is a precondition for building trust and avoiding confrontation which has been reflected in our words and deeds. Bangladesh has never done anything that can be considered provocative for others. Bangladesh never allows its territory as sanctuary for extremists, terrorists and insurgents for perpetrating violence in other countries including India and Myanmar. Bangladesh firmly believes in the peaceful settlement of disputes, which has been reflected in our commitment. Being a developing nation, we are leading the global efforts to maintain peace and security of the world by being one of the highest troops contributors to various United Nations Peace Operations. Implementation of the LBA with India testifies to our stance on peaceful settlement of disputes. Settlement of maritime boundaries harmoniously with India and Myanmar is another example of our firm belief in rules-based international order. International Tribunal for the Law of the Seas (ITLOS) delivered verdict on the maritime boundary dispute between Bangladesh and Myanmar on March 14, 2012 and the Permanent Court of Arbitration gave the verdict about the maritime boundary disputes between Bangladesh and India on July 7, 2014. Bangladesh's approach to resolving the current Rohingya crisis amicably further testifies to our respect for peaceful settlement of disputes. We have an excellent working relationship with the BSF of India which is missing in the case of Myanmar. To make the environment conducive, after assuming command of BGB, I immediately visited Myanmar and also invited Myanmar Border Guard Police Chief to visit Bangladesh for the first time after our independence, in 1971. My visit to Myanmar played a pivotal role to establish direct communication between two forces. Following the chief level meeting, bi-annual meeting between senior officers of both the forces is continuing till today. Sector and battalion level meetings are also organised quarterly or as and when required. Information sharing between the bordering forces at the top level has had a cascading effect at functional level between border guarding forces of Bangladesh and India. Information sharing at lateral and parallel level of command has ensured success in the drive against smugglers, human traffickers, insurgents, extremists, and criminals which have defused tension,removed misunderstanding and developed trust and confidence. For example, whenever we obtained some information about smuggling or human trafficking inside India, we shared this with BSF, and they took appropriate measures. We also rescued the victims of human trafficking from India with the help of BSF. Eventually, it developed mutual trust between the two forces. We are also trying to develop same level of information sharing with Myanmar. The Coordinated Border Management Plan (CBMP) signed in 2011 aims to synergise the efforts of both the border guarding forces for checking cross border illegal activities and crimes as well as for maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the India-Bangladesh border. Following the guideline of CBMP, a joint team finalised a list of 366 vulnerable stretches/patches along the entire border for extra vigilance. Coordinated Patrolling is carried out by both the border guarding forces and special attention is given to guard/observe those vulnerable patches. Recently this has been started with BGP of Myanmar as well. It is giving dividend in curbing transnational crimes including misunderstanding. The border conferences or flag meetings with counterparts at grassroots levels are held at regular intervals or as and when required. Such meetings are considered to be an effective tool for resolving the border issue and also for developing mutual understanding and confidence between the forces on the ground. As part of confidence-building measures, exchange of greetings, frequent courtesy meetings at battalion and company level even without any issue generates the desired level of trust between the border guarding forces of Bangladesh and India. Games and sports, cultural programmes, exchange of training, shooting competitions, seminars related to border management and visits by various delegations including members of family welfare association and school children are arranged to ensure continued and enhanced interaction. As a gesture of friendship, critical BGB patients receive advanced treatment in reputed BSF hospitals in India. As the Director-General of BGB, I was the first overseas \"Chief Guest\" in the history of BSF to review the passing out parade at BSF Academy Tekanpur in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh on August 8, 2015. Following Bangladesh-Indian model we have started various confidence-building measures like exchange of visits, games and sports, etc with BGP of Myanmar as well. HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT FOR 'FORCIBLY DISPLACED MYANMAR NATIONALS'\n Currently, 1.1 million 'Forcibly Displace Myanmar Nationals' are stationed in 31 camps covering an area of 6,500 acres. Bangladesh Army provided shelter, life-saving treatment, food and water, and managed the trauma. The army is also ensuring physical security of the camps and coordinating the relief operations of other national and international agencies. Army is also playing a leading role in mitigating disaster risk at Rohingya camps which are prone to landslide, cyclone and flash flood being located near the coastal areas. Bangladesh Army facilitated UNHCR, IOM, other UN agencies and NGOs/INGOs to start and continue their humanitarian activities. Along with the humanitarian operations it is important to note what Bangladesh Army is doing in reducing tension between two neighbouring states. We established direct communication with Myanmar military leadership.  Besides direct contact at the strategic level, concerns are also intimated to Myanmar through different channels. Such communication played a meaningful role in maintaining normalcy, avoiding misunderstanding and reducing tension in the border. To develop mutual trust, cooperation, training activities, and develop a roadmap for future engagements between two forces, the first staff talks were held in Dhaka on June 2017. Now we are pursuing Myanmar to conduct the second staff talks in Myanmar. I have already been invited by the  Commander in Chief of Myanmar Army to visit Myanmar in December this year and I have also invited the Myanmar Commander in Chief and Myanmar Army Chief to visit Bangladesh. National and international media has the full freedom to ensure a free flow of information which helped the world community to get an accurate picture of the sufferings of the 'Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals' and the role of our Government and the Army in humanitarian operations. A FEW SUGGESTIONS In view of the above discussions, a few measures may be useful in developing and maintaining trust among land forces of the Indo-Pacific region. Respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity in words and deeds can keep our region secure and stable. Sharing of information at various levels among security agencies are required to defuse tension, eliminate misunderstanding and develop trust and confidence. Regular meetings may be held at the level of 'National Security Chiefs', 'Army Chiefs', and 'Border Guard Heads' to strengthen relations among law enforcement, intelligence and security agencies as part of curbing extremism, terrorism and transnational crimes. Coordinated border patrolling along the border can contribute significantly to developing trust and mutual respect between forces operating on the ground. Exchange programmes and joint exercises can contribute significantly to developing trust and mutual respect between forces as well as countries. To strengthen further cooperation, exchange programme among training institutions may be planned among the Indo-Pacific land forces at regular intervals. Issues like technology and Excess Defence Article transfer, knowledge sharing, increased exchange programs, and collaboration in 'operations other than war' can contribute to capacity building of armies of this region. CONCLUSION We live in an interconnected world in which our security is now permanently linked to that of others. Security within the region should be sustainable as far as possible in order to maintain stability and development. The Indo-Pacific region where we belong has flourished over a considerable period under an international rules-based order that allows access to seas and airways, fair trade, etc. Developing trust among Indo-Pacific Land Forces in the region can keep areas secure and ensure a better future for our next generation. ---------------------------------------------------- Excerpt from the speech of General Aziz Ahmed, BSP, BGBM, PBGM, BGBMS, psc, G, Chief of Army Staff, Bangladesh Army at the Indo-Pacific Armies Chiefs Conference (IPACC XI) held in Bangkok, Thailand on 09 September 2019.

      "text": "Hundreds of thousands of anti-government protesters joined a mass rally in Hong Kong yesterday, filling major thoroughfares in heavy rain in the eleventh week of what have been often violent demonstrations in the Asian financial hub. Yesterday's turnout showed that the movement still has broad-based support despite the ugly scenes witnessed during the past week when protesters occupied the Chinese-ruled city's airport, for which some activists apologised. There was an uneasy calm after nightfall, with no violent confrontations and protesters unclear on what would happen next. Police in riot gear checked the IDs of some demonstrators to the west of the Central business district, and there was a large police presence outside the Western District police station. \"They've been telling everyone we're rioters. The march today is to show everyone we are not,\" said a 23-year-old named Chris, who works in marketing and was dressed all in black, including a scarf covering his face and baseball cap. \"It does not mean we won't keep fighting. We will do whatever is necessary to win, but today we take a break, then we reassess.\" One protester shouted at others who were jeering at police, \"Today is a peaceful march! Don't fall into the trap! The world is watching us,\" prompting the group to move on. Anger over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China erupted in June, but the rising unrest has been fuelled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the \"one country, two systems\" formula put in place after Hong Kong's return from British to Chinese rule in 1997. Protesters held aloft placards with slogans including \"Free Hong Kong!\" and \"Democracy now!\" and umbrellas to shield them from the rain. The crowd in Victoria Park, where the rally started, was peaceful and included elderly people as well as the middle aged, young people and families, with some parents carrying toddlers. Despite rally organisers not having permission to march, the park could not accommodate the crowd, which thronged the streets around the park. Many protesters headed towards the city's financial centre, chanting for the city's Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, to step down. It was impossible to put an exact figure on the number of protesters but Reuters journalists, reporting from around the territory, put the total at least 200,000. \"It's bloody hot and it's raining. It's a torture just to turn up, frankly. But we have to be here because we have no other choice,\" said a 24-year-old student named Jonathan who was at the rally that began in Victoria Park in the Causeway Bay district of Hong Kong island. \"We have to continue until the government finally shows us the respect that we deserve,\" he said. Aside from Lam's resignation, demonstrators are seeking complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as \"rioting\", a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform. \"When we were young, we didn't think about it. But my son tells me: After 2047, what will happen to me?,\" said a history teacher named Poon, referring to the year when the 50-year agreement enshrining Hong Kong's separate system will lapse."

      "text": "Mud houses are not uncommon in rural Bangladesh but they don't have 108 rooms like the one at a Naogaon village. Built in 1986 by some well-off land owners, the two-storied house stands on an acre in Alipur village under Mohadevpur upazila. While char dwellers like corrugated-iron-sheet houses for easy shifting during flood and erosions, affluent people in dry regions preferred mud houses before concrete started making a splash. Mud houses are eco-friendly and are cool during the summer. There are many mud houses in remote villages of the Barind region. The one in Alipur village, seven kilometres from Naogaon's Nohata intersection, stands apart with its enormous size. Those who built the house as a hobby are Shamsher Ali Akanda, Taher Ali Akanda and their brother-in-law Taser Uddin Mondol. The house is 300 feet long and 100 feet wide, has 11 main entries, and 12 staircases to go to the first floor. The roof is made of corrugated iron sheets and there are rectangular spaces between rooms. Shamsher's son Azahar Ali Akanda said his ancestors engaged hundred labourers and also got their hands dirty to build the house. It took seven months to complete. \"They collected mud from cropland on the east side of the house,\" he said, adding, \"They did it out of pleasure. They thought their sons and daughters would live in it together.\" They used bamboo, wood, and straws mixed with mud for the walls and floors. For the roof, they used 200 bundles of corrugated iron sheets collected from several shops, according to Azahar. Since the demise of Akandas and Mondols, families of eight of their sons have been living in the house, said Cheragpur Union Parishad Chairman Shibnath Mishra. Although many tourists visit the house every year, the heirs, for whom it was built, have hurt its grandeur whilst dividing it among themselves with walls. \"Before one could go to any room through any of the main doors but now the successors have built mud or concrete walls at places,\" Azahar told The Daily Star. During a recent visit, this correspondent saw some inheritors erecting concrete walls and placing tiles. Some were putting red mud and white lime on the floors and walls for preservation. Taher's son Masud Rana said he brought some changes with concrete and tiles because repairing with mud was difficult. \"The mud repair process needs expertise and time. We don't have that.\" Azahar's wife Reshma Begum said, \"My in-laws had strong aesthetic sense. But their inheritors hardly understand it. I frequently repair my portion.\" The residents now use some rooms for storing harvests and some as guest rooms. \"All the rooms are used someway. The 20-inch walls keep us cool in summer and warm in winter,\" said Reshma. Sometimes the house moves when someone walks on certain parts on the first floor, she added. Upazila Nirbahi Officer Mobarak Hossain said they were working to protect the mud house considering its tourism value."

      "text": "The generation of the 90s where I belong to has grown up with a very popular group of cartoon characters: Meena, Raju, and Mithu. It was a time when the social norms of the entire world were undergoing major changes. In that important era, this cartoon played an important role to expose many social problems through some dialogic animations, creating awareness, and giving solutions to those problems. I wonder, why the current government is not taking such initiatives to solve many contemporary social issues. Personally, I was very fond of this cartoon series and it has influenced me a lot. In my childhood, I had a belief that those characters were real. They were always in my mind even if I was sleeping or attending a class in school. I personally dreamed of growing up in the role of Raju, a loving brother of a caring sister. At that time, thousands of superstitious beliefs, cultural orthodox, and shameful social customs were victimising people in the rural areas of South Asian countries. Even urban women were not free from those barriers of the twentieth century. In that circumstance, an animated cartoon character \"Meena\" was introduced with the help of UNICEF where the character \"Meena\" was completely different from the erstwhile girls because of her progressive thoughts and activities. Through a long-term field research done by UNICEF Bangladesh, this \"Meena\" character, with all other supporting roles, created a meaningful story. At first, they came to Ram Mohan, one of the most popular cartoon artists in South Asia, also known as the father of Indian animation. He was requested to create a face that could be acceptable to everyone. After hard work, Meena appeared in his painting. Hannah-Barbara's studio in Manila, Philippines, featured its several early-stage episodes. Rest of the episodes were created at Ram Mohan Studio in India and this series was directed by Ram Mohan himself. Although there were no other satellite channels in Bangladesh except Bangladesh Television, the story and the message of this cartoon reached not only every corner of the country, but other places around the world as this was translated into Bengali, English, Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Pashto, Portuguese, etc. In a research of UNICEF, it was found that 95 percent of Bangladeshi people knew about \"Meena\" and her activities in the 90s. This cartoon was a remarkable success. In the cartoon, Promita Ganguly voiced the character of Meena in 2005 when she was in class seven. \"When the rains are high during the flood, we put a wicker in the canal or pond water, so that we can understand how bad the flood is. This is what I learned from my father\"--this is one of the dialogues that Meena uses in the cartoon. Raju's voice was given by Abrar Sajid when he was in class one, and Mr Kamal Ahsan, a performer on stage, radio and television, gave Mithu's voice which was quite popular among the audience. \"My name is Mithu,\" this was the famous dialogue of Meena's sweet and naughty bird. The children in the 90s were forced to obey the rules imposed by society even if they were illogical and unjustified. Arguing, defending and opposing elders were considered ill-mannered behaviour. Giving opinions when elders were talking was not seen positively--so children couldn't go into any conversation to express their thoughts. If it was about girls or even women, they were not allowed to talk about equal rights. It was challenging for them to go to school and to be educated. Somewhere it was prohibited! Through Meena's message, it was possible to point these out and try to change the psychology of the society. This is why children of that time grabbed it enthusiastically. They went into it deeply. I still remember how much I was worried when I saw \"Meena\" being stopped from going to school. Seeing \"Meena\" upset, many children of our time cried--even our uneducated village mothers thought Meena should go to school. This was the change created by a simple cartoon character, Meena. She was a representative of those extremely brilliant rural girls who had merit but were stuck like caged birds. When \"Meena\" was barred from going to school, she sent Mithu secretly to learn school lessons so that she could learn from Mithu later. Mithu was a parrot who was intelligent, conscious and helpful, so \"Meena\" took Mithu wherever she went. Meena's passion for learning inspired many girls to go to school. Mithu came back from school learning the counting table of 3 and taught Meena. While Meena was practicing, she realised that they had six hens altogether. She was so happy about it. One day she found that one hen was missing. Immediately she informed her family and her family was able to prevent the loss of one hen. Most people realised that sending a girl to school not only benefits her, but also her family, her society and her country. This is why Napoleon said, \"Give me an educated mother, I shall promise you the birth of a civilised, educated nation.\" This is how the animated sequel, \"Meena\", changed the perception of the society. Equal rights, ensuring the health facilities for everyone, the importance of washing hands before meals and after using toilet, preventing dowry, sexual harassment in the streets, benefits of modern medical systems, HIV contagiousness, warning of traditional and domestic methods of ancient times, immunisation, children's sports, delivering babies right way, social superstitions, importance of breastfeeding, and what not, were highlighted for creating awareness through this cartoon sequel. This way, it was possible to make a better society. This cartoon is still inspiring our children to go to school and get them interested in education. The lesson that parents take months to teach their children, this cartoon managed in only one episode. As this was quite popular not only at that time but also today, Google launched a game in their play-store named \"Meena Game\". Sometimes BBC also broadcasts some of its episodes to inspire school-going children. However, if such a positive change could be made through a simple cartoon character in one of the underdeveloped regions of the world, why not create such a character to solve some social problems happening today? Rape, killing innocent people, misuse of student politics, etc., could also be solved this way, I believe. It is high time to think about it.

      "text": "The government is looking to upgrade the Bangladesh Water Development Board to the Directorate of Water Resources in which non-engineers will not be absorbed as cadres, said officials from the general category.  With an aim to conserve and better manage the country's water resources, the government formulated a draft law -- the Bangladesh Water Resources Development and Management Act 2019 -- and uploaded it to the Ministry of Water Resource's website on December 1, seeking public opinion on the draft.  In an initial response, several serving non-engineers (general category officials) said that although they would have to play an important role in the new directorate, they were being deprived from the upgradation process.  The first draft, uploaded on the website on November 28, stated that both the general officials and engineers would be absorbed as cadres.  But within three days, a new draft was uploaded, which said the non-engineer general category first class government officers (grade nine) were excluded. \"If the provision for general cadre is not mentioned in the draft law, then we would not be considered while officials of the board are absorbed as cadres,\" said an official working under WDB, wishing anonymity.  \"But different general category officials working with the WDB play an important role and have the qualifications to be absorbed as cadres.\"  Apart from engineers, professionals like agriculturalists, soil scientists, geologists, economists, environmentalists, fisheries experts, accountants have been working ever since the formation of WDB.  A candidate has to have the same qualification as a Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) applicant for those first-class posts and they get appointment under the ninth grade.  \"Being absorbed as a cadre is not about getting monetary benefits, but rather about dignity,\" the official added. As per Section 7(a) of the draft law, the new directorate will have jurisdiction over the construction of dams, barrages and other structures for river management, flood protection and drought control.  It will also be responsible for dredging of the rivers and canals, irrigation, fish cultivation, conservation of aquatic animals, afforestation for conservation of wildlife, protecting human habitations and establishments from river erosions and protection of the environment and ecology.  Section 7 (b) mentions other activities of the directorate, including flood and drought forecasts, surveys, research and knowledge discrimination of water related works, ensure participation of local people in different projects, make independent proposals for land acquisition and rehabilitation of affected people, conduct impact assessment work on agriculture, environment, water transport, fisheries and human habitation due to any certain project.  The contribution of officials in both the engineering and general categories are required with equal importance for these tasks. When asked about the issue, Kabir Bin Anwar, secretary for the ministry of Water Resources, said, they were upgrading the WDB to Directorate of Water Resources as they need to enhance the capability of the agency to implement the Delta Plan 2100 (BDP 2100). The government approved the BDP 2100 on September 4, 2018, with the aspiration of achieving a safe, climate resilient and prosperous delta by 2100. The formation process of the Directorate of Water Resources is in its initial stages and it has not yet been decided who would be included in the cadre services.  \"It is too early to comment on the cadre service as it is just a draft law and will take at least six months to finalise. I do not think those officials have anything to worry about yet.\" The government agency responsible for surface water and groundwater management was established in 1972, when the then Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority was broken down into two parts -- WDB and Bangladesh Power Development Board.

Billal Ahmed was assured by his travel agent that he would safely make it to Italy. \"There would be no risk at all,\" the agent had said.  Billal along with 15 others were rescued in the Mediterranean in May after a boat carrying 86 people to Italy from Libya capsized off the Tunisian coast. As many as 71 people, including Billal's three nephews, died on that perilous journey.  A resident of Mohidpur village in Sylhet's Fenchuganj upazila, Billal, 31, is the youngest among nine siblings and has not married yet. He dropped out of school after class five. He was doing well with fish farming and paddy cultivation until a devastating flash flood hit him hard in 2017. \"I could not earn anything that year. So, I thought, I should try my luck aboard. I was looking for an opportunity,\" he told this correspondent at his village home recently. In September 2018, he met Enamul Haque at a wedding party of one of his relatives at a nearby village. Enamul told him that he had a travel agency in Sylhet and sent many people to Europe. And Billal would have to pay him Tk 9 lakh once he reached Italy. Hearing about this, Billal's three nephews -- Ahmed Ali, Liton Ahmed and Azizul Islam -- wanted to join him. They were doing their bachelor's at Osmani Nagar Degree College. \"Initially, their parents did not like it. But they finally gave consent knowing that four of us would be going together and there was no risk of losing money,\" said Billal. Enam said their flight tickets to Italy will come from India. After getting Indian tourist visas for them, Enam bought them Dhaka-Sylhet bus tickets and gave them a contact number of another travel agent named Razzaque, who would do the rest.  On December 4 last year, Billal and his three nephews started for Dhaka. In Fakirapool, they met Razzaque at a bus counter. He gave them bus tickets to Kolkata and plane tickets for Kolkata-Delhi, Delhi-Mumbai and Mumbai-Colombo routes. They were received at Benapole border by an on-duty policeman, who helped them complete immigration procedures and cross the border. \"We stayed in Kolkata, Delhi and Mumbai for a few days and then flew to Colombo where Mehedi, a member of the Enam-Razzaque gang, received us at the airport,\" Billal said.  After three days, Mehedi arranged their plane tickets to Libya's Misrata via Qatar and Tunisia, saying they will get plane tickets to Italy in Libya. As they arrived at Misrata airport, they met another gang member named Rubel, along with some Libyans, who bribed the immigration officer and arranged their on-arrival visas. They reached Libya 12 days after they had left home.All was well so far as Enam and Razzaque were in touch with them via video calling app Imo. They left Misrata airport on a van that took them to a well-protected house with high walls in a desert after a three-hour drive. Besides Rubel, three Libyan men carrying heavy arms were in that house. They put all of them in a small room. Rubel gave them each a piece of Khbeiza (a local bread), and water. After a while, he provided them with Wifi password and said they had to spend a huge amount of money to buy their plane tickets. He asked for Tk 20 lakh for four of them and said the money had to be sent through Enam. \"But I said it was a body contract. We were supposed to pay the money only after reaching Italy,\" Billal told this correspondent.  \"For talking back, they beat me up with a steel pipe. Actually, they held us hostage ... We contacted our family members and asked them to pay Enam Tk 20 lakh.\" The next day, Rubel came and inquired about the money. \"We already agreed to pay them. But they were not ready to wait. The next day they came and beat all of us with steel pipes. He made us call our home and ask for the money. He [Rubel] also warned that we would be killed if police are informed.\"  It took three days to arrange the money. Billal's nephew Mofiz Hossain gave it to Enam by cheque and in cash in Sylhet. In the meantime, the four were beaten up three to four times. Once Enam received the money, Rubel put four of them in the boot of the car and took them to somewhere in Tripoli.  \"It was too hot inside the boot. The road was bad and it was very painful to travel in that. They did not give us anything to eat or drink,\" said Billal. They took us to the basement of a five-storey building. It had two small rooms where 16 Bangladeshis had already been held captive. After three days, Rubel and some Libyans came and took away their cell phones, other valuables and the US dollars they had. They were locked in those two tiny rooms all the time. The number of captives rose to 41 within a few days. Most of those people were from Sylhet region; some were from Habiganj and some from Bianibazar. One day, came Mehedi, who received them in Colombo. Billal said this time the gang asked for Tk 2 lakh more from each of them and gave them a phone to call home.   They already lost track of date. But when they called home with Mehedi's phone, they learnt that nearly a month had gone by. \"Whenever our family members inquired about us, Enam said we were doing fine and soon we would reach Italy,\" Billal added.   After getting the money, the gang took them to a place in Zuwarah, a port city in northwestern Libya.  It took them three days to reach the place. They were put in the boot of the car and they had to travel all the way lying inside it.  After the whole day's drive through desert, they would stop in the evening by sheds made for shepherds. Only Khbeiza and some water were their meal.  After three days, they reached a two-storey building. Some other Bangladeshis were already there. The gang brought many others from Tripoli to Zuwarah, four to five at a time. Within days, the number of people reached 82, all of them Bangladeshis. \"They kept all of us in three rooms -- 12 feet by 12 feet each. There were only one stove and one washroom for us,\" said Billal. \"They used to give us 25kg rice, two to three kg lentil and onion for two days. We used to cook khichuri with those. We had only six bowls and two pots.  \"We did not get enough water to drink. We rationed water by measuring it with a tea cup,\" he said. \"It was not possible for all of us to sleep at the same time. Some of us used to sleep in two rooms while the others stayed awake in another room. \"We were starving and becoming weak. We wanted more food. But they never gave it; rather they beat us with steel pipes.\" They were locked in and some Libyans used to guard the house. Rubel used to come every two or three days. One day he told them if they wanted extra food, they would have to buy it from him. But they had no money. They again called home and asked for more money. Billal said his family members in Sylhet gave Enam Tk 2.5 lakh through bKash for providing him with food. One day Rubel wanted to sell a few packs of milk to them. But none of them had any money. But he did not believe that and became furious. \"They poured petrol in our water tank. We were forced to drink from it as there was no other source of water,\" he said. Almost half of them became sick after drinking that water. But they were not given any medicine. \"Even I saw one person licking sweats, as there was no drinking water,\" Billal said. \"It was horrible ... It was almost impossible to survive there. We had to spend three days like this.\" He said they begged the gang members to send them back home. \"But they would not listen to us. Our family members also requested Enam to make arrangements for our return. When they put pressure on Enam, he informed Rubel about it. And we would be beaten up again.\" Some of them were keeping the count of days with scratches on the wall. It was three and a half months in that house. Finally, on the night of the first Ramadan, the gang members told them that they would be sent to Italy. The gang then started moving them to another house near the coast. The gang brought some other people from different places. The number of captives rose to 156. Most of them were Bangladeshis. At least 16 were from Morocco and Egypt. There were three small fiberglass boats on the seashore.  \"Seeing such small boats, many of us did not want to get on those. They again beat us up... They then put all of us in three small boats. After sailing for a couple of hours, we saw a fishing trawler anchored in the sea,\" said Billal. \"All of us boarded the trawler.\" Two of those fibreglass boats were tied to the fishing trawler. And Rubel and some of the Libyan guards took the other boat and went back to the shore. The fishing trawler started around 7:00am the next day. Around 9:00pm, the armed Libyans forced them to get on the two fibreglass boats and left by the trawler. Now they were on their own.   \"The boat ahead of us carried around 70 people and moved to the coast. We were in the second boat and there were 86 people in it. The boat started sinking as soon as the trawler left,\" said Billal. The men in the fishing trawler did not stop or try to rescue them. \"We were begging, crying and screaming. But they just left us there.\" The boat turned upside down and was floating in the sea. They were trying to float themselves holding the rope and the edges of the boat. The water was very cold. \"We were trying to survive, holding each other's hand.  When big waves came, it was hard for us to hold onto the boat.\" Billal said his three nephews were with him. \"My nephews were asking me whether they were going to die. I kept telling them to cling to the boat anyhow and not to lose hope.\" Billal first saw his nephew Ahmed drown. Then Aziz, his another nephew, went down. \"I tried to help them. But they fainted and drowned. I could not do anything.\" His third nephew, Liton, managed to stay afloat. \"Liton was asking again and again whether they would survive or not as he saw two of his cousins drown. I was giving him hope but could not save him,\" said Billal with tears rolling down his cheeks.  Liton drowned just an hour before a Tunisian boat came to rescue them in the morning. Only 16 people out of 86 survived. It was May 10, 2019. The next day Billal called home from Tunisia and informed his family about the incident. Now Billal and the parents of his three nephews want exemplary punishment to Enam, who was arrested in two cases filed under the Human Trafficking Act and the Money Laundering Prevention Act.   Police are yet to submit charge sheets in the cases. According to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), Bangladesh is one of the biggest sources of illegal migrants to Europe. Between January and August 2017, more than 8,700 Bangladeshis arrived in Italy by sea --- roughly 9 percent of all maritime arrivals in the European country, show IOM data. There is no specific data on how many Bangladeshis drowned in the Mediterranean on their perilous journeys to Europe. The IOM said around 500 migrants, including Bangladeshis, either died or went missing in the Mediterranean as of October this year while trying to reach Europe by boats. The figure was 2,299 in 2018 and 3,139 in 2017. Data of Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, show that 93,435 Bangladeshis were staying illegally in European countries till 2015.

The first video used in the misleading posts was originally published on YouTube on August 14, 2014, and is headlined \"Pakistan Air Force F-16 Block 52+ dispensing Flares\" (1). The second video used in the misleading posts shows the same 2014 night flight demonstration from a different angle. This footage was posted on YouTube on September 23, 2016 with a headline: \"Pakistan Airforce Islamabad night flying\" (2). Tensions have soared over Kashmir since a February 14 attack which killed more than 40 Indian paramilitaries, and was claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group. In that time social media in both countries have seen a flood of fake videos and photos. India's military has said its jets carried out air strikes on February 26, 2019, hitting militant camps in retaliation for the suicide attack. Pakistan's military rejects that account and says that after Indian planes intruded into its airspace, it scrambled jets and chased the Indian planes out, saying they dropped their payload harmlessly in Pakistani territory while fleeing. The suggestion that the two viral videos in question here are linked to Tuesday's incursion is false; the videos are from 2014.  "

He also spelt out a number of reasons behind the excessive cost of the power plant compared to Kudunkulam Nuclear Power Plant in India. The minister made the statement while responding to a tabled starred question from BNP MP Rumeen Farhana in the Parliament. She in her question said that the capital expenditure of the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant is Tk 45,000 crore higher than that of Kudunkulam Nuclear Power Plant in India. Yeafesh said that the infrastructural expenditure of the nuclear power plant in Bangladesh is comparatively higher than that of India as the country is new in setting up nuclear power plant. \"India is operating and managing nuclear power plants for more than 50 years. As a result, they are self-sufficient in the setting of nuclear power plant,\" he said. He mentioned that currently 22 nuclear power plants are operating in India while another six is under construction and another 20 such plants have been approved. The minister said that costing of each nuclear power plants depends on project site and site location, type of reactor technology, project management approach and contractual obligation of the contract, fund and financing scheme of the projects, national infrastructure to support nuclear power plant and licensing and legal aspects. He also said that it was tough to compare a nuclear power plant with another due to differences above mentioned matters. On the other hand, the Science and Technology Affairs Minister said that comparing a new country and the experienced one of implementing nuclear power plant was tough. He also mentioned that soil condition of Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant project area was made usable for implementing a nuclear power plant, steps were taken like shore protection and filling up soils of the nuclear power plant area as it is situated on the bank of Padma River as the reason of increasing cost of RNPP. Kudunkulam Nuclear Power Plant did not need this specific engineering, he added. He also said that advanced study on site-specific parameters of RNPP like managing earthquake, flood, ecological and others was done in comparison with Kudunkulam Nuclear Power Plant. The fourth session of the current parliament (11th parliament) will continue until September 12. The decision came at the meeting of the Business Advisory Committee of the current parliament held at Jatiya Sangsad on Sunday. Committee chairman and Speaker Dr Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury presided over the meeting. The session will resume at 5:00 pm every working day."

      "text": "The government has been making good progress in buying rice from millers but it is lagging far behind its target for buying paddy from farmers, who had protested recently for not getting decent price for their produce.  With only a month and week left until the government procurement ends, the food ministry has only been able to buy, as of July 15, less than 30 percent of its paddy purchase target of 4 lakh tonnes. In stark contrast is the government's progress in buying rice from millers. Since the procurement began on April 25, it has bought 69 percent of its target of 11.5 lakh tonnes. An expert has said the government is unlikely to achieve its buying targets before the deadline. However, Food Minister Sadhan Chandra Majumder told The Daily Star on Monday, \"We could not buy paddy directly from farmers in the last 10 days due to heavy rain and flood in some areas. But we have already formed 20 teams and sent them to various districts to expedite the paddy procurement.\"  He said they have also instructed local offices to speed up buying rice too.  On July 15, the minister asked all deputy commissioners to ensure that paddy is bought directly from farmers.  The offices of the Upazila Controller of Food buy paddy from farmers at the upazila level, and the offices of the District Controller of Food at the district level. The UNOs and DCs monitor the process, said officials.  The slow paddy purchase is hurting tens of thousands of farmers some of whom took to the street earlier this year as the market price for Boro paddy was lower than the government-estimated production cost.  The government had estimated the production cost to be Tk 24.83 per kg.  Good Boro and previous Aush and Aman harvests, higher stocks at public and private granaries as well as imports caused paddy prices to plummet in the local market.  This week, a kg of paddy was being sold for Tk 16, according to the data of the Department of Agricultural Marketing. The government buys paddy for Tk 26 a kg from farmers.  Millers have been preferred over growers since 1991. That year, the Directorate of Food bought 15 percent of its procurement target as paddy from growers. It got the rest from millers in the form of rice. Millers have been gaining more from the government's food grain procurement policy, the objective of which is to provide price support to farmers.  Frustrated by low prices, many farmers this year threatened to stop growing paddy and the government had to say that it would buy 4 lakh tonnes of paddy from growers rather than the 1.5 lakh tonnes it initially intended to.  Md Asaduzzaman, former research director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, said the price of paddy was poor and it was unlikely to increase this year. \"So, the farmers are likely to suffer this year.\"  \"The data of procurement shows that the procurement system favours rice than paddy. I doubt whether the government can achieve its targeted procurement within the timeframe,\" he said. The slow procurement process is evident at the field level.  In Kushtia for instance, the local food department has a target to buy 2,730 tonnes of paddy from farmers but until July 18, it purchased only 1,174 tonnes. However, it already bought 26,000 tonnes of rice against its target of 29,000 tonnes.  \"Yes, we are lagging behind the targeted paddy procurement. It is because of delay in getting the farmers' lists from the agricultural department. But we hope that we would be able to achieve the target within the deadline,\" Monowar Hossain, district controller of food in Kushtia, told The Daily Star.  In Bogura Sadar upazila, the local food office purchased 240 tonnes of paddy. Its target is 787 tonnes.   \"In the first phase, we planned to purchase 295 tonnes but we could get 240 tonnes. In the second phase, we plan to buy 492 tonnes but we are yet to start procuring as we got the farmers list recently,\" Monirul Haque, food controller of the upazila, told The Daily Star.  Farmer Milon Islam said, \"I cultivated paddy on 25 bighas of land but could not sell a single kg to the government as I could not get enlisted.\" Noted economist Hossain Zillur Rahman said the government talks about development of agriculture but not of farmers.  \"Farmers take-home pay is very important. If it is not ensured then farmers would not be benefitted. Development of agriculture and development of farmers are not the same and paddy procurement has showed us this,\" he told The Daily Star."

Local people alleged that the number of loss had increased in the district because of not having enough flood control embankments along the rivers. Riverside people have been demanding construction of embankments since the cyclone hit the coastal areas over 11 years ago. After a long wait of over 11 years, repair work of 23 kilometre embankments under Pirojpur Sadar, Indurkani, Bhandaria and Kawkhali upazilas started last year, Pirojpur Water Development Board (WDB) Executive Engineer Sayeed Ahammad said.  WDB started the construction work at a cost of Tk 13.61 crore last year and expected to complete the work by June this year. Of the 23 kilometre embankments, 11 kilometre is in Indurkani upazila, which is encircled by three rivers -- Kacha, Baleshwar and Panguchi. Meanwhile, locals alleged that the newly constructed embankment will bring no benefit to the riverside people as it is being built with riverside soil, which will surely wash away in flood or tidal surges. \"Every time a strong wave of the Kacha river hit the shore, it washes away some soil of the newly constructed dyke,\" Enayet Hossain of Togra village in Indurkani upazila said. Besides, a huge quantity of aquatic plants have also been damaged by excavators during construction of the embankment, using excavator machines, locals alleged. Shamim Howlader, another resident of the village, said strong waves of the river directly hit the embankment and wash away its soil. \"The embankment has been constructed in such a way that it cannot be used for even a walk,\" another villager Sanaullah said. If geo textile bags are dumped along the embankments, it will last long, Engineer Sayeed said, adding that they will send proposal to the higher authorities in this regard. According to WDB, there are a total of 230 kilometre embankments in seven upazilas of the district. Of the length, a stretch  of 51 kilometres is in Indurkani upazila."

However, trade data showed retail prices of the key kitchen staple were hovering around Rs 70-80 per kg in most parts of the country, depending on quality and region. Prices have been rising for the last one month due to supply disruption from flood-affected producing states like Maharashtra. The rise was sharp in the last few days due to heavy rains in key growing states. Prices in Bangladesh surged overnight after traders hiked rates in the wake of restriction imposed by India on shipments of the tuber to other countries to contain its domestic prices. Bangladesh meets a portion of its annual demand through imports for inadequate domestic production. Indian Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan tweeted yesterday that the government has adequate stocks and asked state governments to take as much as they wanted. The Indian government is improving supply in the domestic market by offloading its buffer stock, which stands at about 50,000 tonnes, out of which 15,000 tonnes have been released. Paswan said the Indian government has so far released 1,850 tonnes to Tripura, 2,000 tonnes to Haryana and 960 tonnes to Andhra Pradesh at the rate of Rs 15.59 per kg. These states will sell to consumers at a maximum rate of Rs 23.90 per kg. On Tuesday, the minister had indicated that the government would consider imposing stock limit on traders if current high price situation continues in the coming days. "

Marise Payne said this at a meeting with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at hotel InterContinental in the city. PM's Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim briefed reporters after the meeting. \"We would like to stay in touch on this issue,\" the Australian minister was quoted as saying. Marise Payne informed the Prime Minister that Australia will enhance its contributions further to this humanitarian issue and appreciated Bangladesh for giving shelter to a large number of displaced Rohingyas. She also appreciated the Prime Minister's role in women empowerment and said she herself a fan of cricket like the Bangladesh Prime Minister. She said her country wants the Australian cricket team to visit Bangladesh as per schedule. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh has given shelter to 1.1 million Rohingyas on humanitarian ground, and Bangladesh and Myanmar signed agreements over the repatriation of Rohingyas, but the deal is not being implemented because of the reluctance of Myanmar authority. Noting that Rohingya issue is a big burden for Bangladesh, she said some 100,000 babies were born by the time at Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar. Earlier, the heads of delegations of the participating countries in the 3rd IORA Blue Economy Ministerial Conference jointly met Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. At the meeting, the heads of the delegations said they will extend support to the Dhaka declaration as there had been very vibrant discussion at the conference. The Prime Minister said this conference will add a new dimension to the forum. The people of Bangladesh, living in six seasons, are facing the furry of natural calamities like cyclone, flood, tidal surge and river erosion, she said. Sheikh Hasina said her government has taken measures to combat the natural calamities. She said artificial mangrove forests are being developed at the coastal belt to protect the lives and property of people from natural disasters. Assuming power, her government took various preparedness measures to prevent loss of lives and property during the natural calamities, she said. The Prime Minister stressed the need for protecting ecological balance. Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen, Principal Secretary Md Nojibur Rahman and Foreign Secretary Md Shahidul Haque were present."

According to fisheries office in Moulvibazar, fish production in the portion of the haor that falls under Kulaura, Barlekha and Juri upazila of the district was 32.5 thousand tonnes in 2014, 34.3 thousand in 2015, 35.7 thousand in 2016, 40.1 thousand in 2017 and 41.6 thousand tonnes last year. The office also claimed that 112 species of fish are now found in Hakaluki Haor compared to 106 species found in a survey conducted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 2006. During a recent visit to Dakhinbazar market in Kulaura upazila headquarters, this correspondent found different local varieties of fish including shing (stinging catfish), magur (walking catfish), tengra (mystus), bele (scribbled gobi), baim (tyre-track eel), puti (swamp barb) and koi (climbing perch). Shipon Das, a fisherman from Bhukshimoil village in Kulaura, told this correspondent that, beforehand, they used to catch only half kilogram of local fish per day in the haor. But over the last couple of years, the fish population has multiplied. Now they can catch around two to three kilograms of native fish per day, he claimed. The temporary ban on fishing, release and maintenance of fries by the government, after the huge loss of fish in the flash flood in 2017, helped revive the fish population in the haor, Shipon said. Everyday huge quantities of local fish are coming from the Haor and fish traders are getting profit beyond their expectation, said Mujibur Rahman, a wholesale fish trader at Magura area in Kulaura upazila. Kulaura Upazila Senior Fisheries Officer Mohammad Sultan Mahmud said over and unplanned fishing using fine nets, use of harmful pesticides in farmlands, construction of roads and houses by filling canals and water bodies and unplanned irrigation projects and construction of dams mainly causes the extinction of local fish species. Besides, fish breeding is being hampered due to rampant netting of brood fish and fries, he added. Md Emdadul Haque, district fisheries officer in Moulvibazar, said it is possible to protect the local varieties if people catch fish as per the law. Dr M M Mahbub Alam, chairman of Fish Health Management department in Sylhet Agricultural University, told this correspondent that native fish is richer in nutrition, quality and taste. \"We should take steps to save these species. We need to sanction extensive studies to explore their commercial viability and rescue water bodies to save native fish from extinction,\" he said."

      "text": "Industries Minister Nurul Majid Mahmud Humayun today in the parliament claimed that the onion price has come under control at present. The minister's claim came when the onion price went beyond the purchasing capacity of general people. The necessary cooking ingredient was being sold at Tk 150 per kg, the highest ever price, at the retail markets in the capital. \"I believe the onion market is now under control,\" the minister, in absence of Commerce Minister Tipu Mushi, told the parliament responding to a supplementary question of BNP lawmaker Jahidur Rahman. Nurul Majid said that onion market became went up due to flash flood in India while the country stopped onion export to Bangladesh. \"But we brought the situation under control quickly through importing onion from Myanmar and Turkey,\" he said adding that this is a lean period for onion and crisis of onion usually prevails at this time. \"Our local onion is yet to hit the market, but it will come within a few days,' he said. The minister said the government is launching mobile courts in district and upazilas levels across the country to prevent the selling of onion with higher price while directorate of Consumer Rights Protection and other government agencies are monitoring the market. Replying to a written question from Awami League MP Anwar Khan (Laxmipur-1), the minister said the country produces 23.31 lakh metric tons onion against the annual demand of 24 lakh metric tons. \"Of the produced onion, around 30 per cent are damaged during collection and preservation. That means, the total amount stands 16.31 lakh metric tons. The deficit of the onion is meet up through importing from India,\" he added. The minister said due to the flood in Maharashtra (India), the onion production has damaged seriously and thus, the export price of onion has been raised to $ US 850 from $ US 250-300. \"Later, they (India) stopped exporting onion to Bangladesh as the price shoots up abnormally. As a result, the price of onion in Bangladesh has gone beyond the purchasing capacity of people,\" he said.    The Minister said that the government started to sell onion in the open market through Trading Corporation of Bangladesh to control the onion price."

      "headline": "Fighting Climate Change: PM calls for will of the rich nations",
      "authors": "\nUnb, Munich\n",
      "text": "Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has underscored the \"will\" of the richer segments of societies across the world to act against climate change as there are science, technology, innovation and finance to address the problem. \"Let me also say we've enormous amount of science, technology, innovation, finance to address climate change. We only need the 'will' of the richer segments of societies - everywhere - to act ambitiously against climate change. We need to 'transform' our lifestyles, attitudes, systems, economies,\" she said on Saturday. The PM was delivering her speech at a panel discussion on \"Climate Change as a Security Threat\" at the Conference Hall of the Bayerischer Hof. Climate change has become a real threat to human being with an unabated rise in global temperature, she said About Bangladesh, Hasina said increasing cyclone, storm, and monsoon flooding challenge livelihood of its people. \"Our Bay of Bengal is increasingly getting acidic. Twenty percent of our people are living along the coast and one-third of Bangladesh's population eventually risks displacement with rising sea level although we have little contribution to global warming.\" Hasina said flooding erodes river banks during every monsoon while numerous families overnight become homeless and helpless. \"We lose thousands of acres of precious farmland. And, let's note that our mighty rivers carry nearly one fourth of entire load of sediment carried by all the major river systems in the world every year.\" She mentioned that the erratic pattern and intensity of rainfall and rising heat made farming difficult for Bangladesh's people. There were also reports of growing water stress during dry season. The PM said changing climate was taking its toll. \"Diseases like malaria, which we successfully eradicated risks a comeback,\" she said, adding that temperature variation was challenging breeding of Bangladesh's national fish -- Hilsa. The PM said despite the fact and also findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a lot of people, including those who are conscious of climate change, were yet to understand the climate displacement issue. She said South Asia, East Asia and the pacific experienced the most displacement in such contexts. All together, these regions at present have 8.6 million displaced people due to sudden disasters. Hasina mentioned that an estimated 46 million people were displaced in South Asia alone by sudden disasters during 2008 to 2013, though the actual number of people moving internally and across borders in South Asia was not known. \"It's anticipated that population movements in the context of disasters and climate change in South Asia, South East Asia and in the Indian Ocean rim are likely to increase over the next decades,\" she apprehended. Hasina said the challenges ahead are likely to be enormous, as a recent World Bank report titled \"groundswell-preparing for internal climate migration\" projects that without concrete climate and development actions, in South Asia alone, more than 40 million people could be forced to move within their countries to escape the slow-onset impacts of climate change. \"Bangladesh has been in the forefront in addressing coping mechanisms, particularly in the agricultural sector. We've invented flood-resistant, salt-tolerant and drought-tolerant rice varieties.\" In reply to a query, the PM said Bangladesh military has been engaging with a lot of development activities in the country. It is leading the disaster response in Bangladesh. They can also be engaged in early warning mechanisms. Hasina said most of the UN members are discussing the climate change issue in the multilateral forums. \"We need to keep the discussions and engagements up.\" Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable front-line countries, she said, adding that the government in Bangladesh has included climate actions and disaster risks reduction in its national plan. \"We've invested over 1 percent of our GDP to address climate change impacts. Moreover, $450 million has been allocated from our own sources for adoption and mitigation purposes.\" In 2012, Hasina recalled that she pledged in New York that Bangladesh would pursue a low-carbon development pathway as its commitment to \"collective good\" of tackling climate change. She said Bangladesh has installed around six million solar home systems, provided two million Improved Cook Stoves among the poorest. In spite of limitations, the country allocated $385 million to the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund for adaptation and mitigation. Director of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Hans Joachim chaired the discussion."

      "text": "Bangladesh Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Masud Bin Momen has called for providing financial resources and ensuring technology transfer to the vulnerable countries, including Bangladesh, to face the threats posed by climate change and related disasters. \"Big emitters must go for rapid mitigation of GHGs. Also, providing financial resources and ensuring technology transfer to the vulnerable countries for their adaptation efforts would be the most effective response to the threats to international peace and security posed by climate change and related disasters,\" he said. Momen made the statement at the open debate on \"Addressing the impacts of climate-related disasters on international peace and security\" at UNSC Chamber in the UN headquarters, New York on Friday, according to a message received in Dhaka yesterday.  \"We must redouble our efforts for sustainable development,\" he said, adding that Bangladesh is of the firm view that climate change and related disasters must be discussed in international arena. Masud said, \"Bangladesh is one of the worst affected countries by the impacts of global climate change due to its geographical location and is highly prone to natural disasters such as cyclone, flood, landslide and earthquake.\" He added, \"Climate change poses an existential threat to our 160 million people, although we had hardly contributed to the deterioration of the environment.\" Just 1-degree centigrade increase of global temperature and further sea level rise will result in inundation of a large area of Bangladesh and thus displacement of 40 million people by the end of this century, the ambassador said. Two percent GDP of Bangladesh is regularly lost due to natural calamities and environmental degradation, he said, adding that climate change induced salinity and other disasters are harming rice and other crop production significantly in the country. \"In addition to all these, we have been hosting 1.1 million Rohingyas forcibly displaced from the neighbouring Myanmar. This phenomenon is also impacting our environment severely,\" Masud said. He also said despite numerous challenges, at the national level Bangladesh has been able to reduce casualties in incidents of natural disasters in recent times by taking various measures such as improvement in early warning system, dissemination of information, establishment of cyclone shelters and active engagement of dedicated Cyclone Preparedness Program volunteers for preparedness and response activities. Taken together, these initiatives have significantly increased the nation's capacity to respond proactively to disasters, Masud continued. \"While we emphasise that effective implementation of Paris Agreement and other relevant global documents and mechanisms are must to fight the climate change effects, we are not ignoring the fact that there could be a nexus between climate change and international peace and security, especially in some places for example in Africa and SIDS countries,\" he said. \"Thus, it is required that the whole UN system should work together to improve our knowledge and understanding to find out if climate change poses any direct threat to peace and security in a specific locality or it is one of the multiplying factors,\" he added. The whole UN system should talk in unison for preventing and resolving any crisis that is an evident outcome of adverse effects of climate change, he said."

      "text": "It's a house right on the zero line. Transnational syndicates have turned its kitchen into a storeroom of smuggled motorcycles. They also use it for assembling bikes, bringing in parts like tanks, wheels, headlights and seats from across the border. A section of unscrupulous police officials and even some Border Guard Bangladesh men allegedly have links to the syndicates. The Daily Star came to know about the house during an independent investigation into trafficking through Kasba border in Brahmanbaria.  On October 9, these correspondents, aided by a local police informant, travelled around 54km by road and rail from Brahmanbaria town to Kollapathar area in Kasba upazila. Then it was one-km walk to the border. Around 10:30am, the informant called a person named Md Momen Miah, living in one of the houses built on the zero line, almost touching the Indian fence. Momen, who was using a Bangladeshi SIM, was told that two customers have come to buy a bike. Getting a positive signal, the source then took these correspondents near the house after ten minutes' walk along a trail through dense bushes. There were no border guards around. Talking about the illegal trade to The Daily Star near the zero line, Momen said he had a brand new TVS Apache RTR bike in his kitchen and it costs Tk 1.20 lakh though its authorised price in Bangladesh is Tk 1.60 lakh. As these correspondents showed an interest to buy it, he asked them to meet his aide Monir, who was also known to the police informant. Talking to this paper in Kasba Bazar, Monir said they have to pay border guards on both sides around Tk 2,000 to Tk 5,000 for every bike. \"Police officials also get almost the same amount.\" A wooden slope is set up on the border fence to push a bike onto Bangladesh side after the border is found secure. \"We used to smuggle around eight to 10 bikes almost daily but the situation is tougher now after police arrested six of our members,\" he said. This newspaper talked to some other sources, including syndicate members, and some locals who bought smuggled bikes, to get an insight into the illegal trade.   If any customer wants to get a licence number and registration, the smugglers handover the bike to another group working in Cumilla and Chunarughat in Habiganj, close to Brahmanbaria border. This group removes the chassis number and replaces it with the number of an officially imported bike that was sold from an authorised shop. For this, they collect sale reports from showrooms.  For the entire process regarding the so-called licence and registration, the smugglers take additional Tk five to seven thousand. The customers would get some forged papers alongside a number. On Indian side, the syndicates sometimes register a bike using a local's ID card -- known as Aadhar. Then a complaint is filed with a police station claiming that the bike was stolen, said a Bangladeshi youth, who is linked with the syndicate. \"They file the complaint so that they can get their bike back if it is seized by border guards, claiming it to be a lost property,\" he said, requesting not to be named. The Daily Star could not independently verify this claim. Lt Col Iqbal Hossain, commanding officer of BGB-60 Battalion, told The Daily Star that most of the motorbikes that run in the district are smuggled from India. As the documents are not checked properly, there is an increasing tendency among youths to buy smuggled bikes, he observed. \"We often got information about the smuggled motorbikes but the smugglers kept those in the houses built on zero line. We have no authorisation to conduct drives there,\" said the commanding officer. \"We often express our concerns to our counterparts at flag meetings.\" Sources working for law enforcement agencies say the syndicates mainly use Hakor, Badla, Madla and Bayek border points to smuggle in the bikes. According to sources working for law enforcement agencies, one of the rackets is run by Wasim Miah of Ganganagar village and Hosen Miah of Ramchandrapur village in Cumilla.  Shipon Miah of Gourangona area in Kasba is working closely with the duo. Some other syndicate members in Brahmanbaria are Jahir Miah of Gopinathpur village, Billal Member of Dhojanagar, Rubel Mastar and Sadek Sarder of Nayanpur Bazar and Kamal Mia of Madla village. Apart from police sources, local political leaders confirmed these names but none of the alleged smugglers were available for comments. Md Lukman Hossain, officer-in-charge of Kasba Police Station, said they were trying their best to identify the syndicate members. \"We also warned police officials to work sincerely as stern action will be taken if anyone of them is found guilty.\" Replying to a query, Lt Col Iqbal refused the allegation of BGB men being involved in smuggling. He said they always remain active and conduct drives whenever they found information. THE ARREST \n According to police, six people, including four Indian nationals, were arrested on May 11 after they entered Bangladesh for a bike consignment. The arrestees were identified as Amzad Hossain Shawon, 22, and Hasibul Hasan Anik, 19, of Bangladesh, and Sanjit Devnath, 23, Nirmolendu Chowdhury, 32, Sankar Sarkar, 31, and Bimol Das, 33, of India. Police also recovered one pistol, two pipe guns, six magazines, two walkie-talkies with a charger, one reflective vest, three pairs of leg guards and one pair of hand gloves from them.  Abdul Karim, the then assistant superintendent of police (ASP) of Kasba circle, said the gang used walkie-talkies as mobile network didn't always work properly at the border. ASP Karim, who got transferred to Khulna on October 27, in a statement had said Shawon was a professional smuggler accused in two cases including one for murder. The Indian nationals were also professional smugglers.  But, claimed a local source close to law enforcers, police submitted the charge sheet in a hurry on July 26, without explaining these details to save other syndicate members in Bangladesh.  ASP Karim refuted the claim. He told The Daily Star on October 10 that police did not find any other people's involvement, so they submitted the charge sheet against only the six. \"We needed to submit the charge sheet within 60 working days as required by the law.\" Sources said police arrested the six following a lead they got while investigating a murder that took place on Kasba border on February 26. Mazharul Islam Tanim, 30, was killed because of internal feud of a smuggling racket, said Sub-Inspector Md Faruk, the investigation officer of the case. \"We have found involvement of nine people behind the killing and three are already in custody,\" he said."

      "text": "Most people felt the temperature this summer was higher than previous years, and that it has become intolerable. On the other hand, this perceived rise in temperature has brought satisfaction to the salt producing farmers, who believe the salinity of water will help them produce more in the upcoming years. Since farmers in the coastal areas of Bangladesh failed to meet their production target for the last few years, rising salt levels are desirable to them. Although the layman's thought matches the scientist's expertise in the sense that salinity in water bodies has increased, the news is unfortunately not all good. Rising salinity is actually destroying the fertility of the land and reaching natural reservoirs of fresh water in villages across the coastline, thereby increasing the collateral damage to those inhabiting the areas. The coastal region covers almost 29,000 square km or about 20 percent of Bangladesh, covering more than 30 percent of the cultivable land in the country. Now that the land is facing the altered level of salt and minerals, people are having health issues related to excessive salt intake.  The greatest threat to biodiversity--ecosystems on both land and water--is, in fact, from saltwater encroaching on coastal ecosystems. Excessive salt intake and the resulting outcome on health have prompted many research projects on the topic.  About 53 percent of the coastal areas are affected by salinity. The greatest threat to biodiversity--ecosystems on both land and water--is, in fact, from saltwater encroaching on coastal ecosystems. Excessive salt intake and the resulting outcome on health have prompted many research projects on the topic. Researchers from different institutions have noticed a higher rate of miscarriage and altered blood pressure level in coastal areas. An in-depth study concluded that climate change might be to blame. While miscarriages are not out of the ordinary, scientists from ICDDR,B (International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh), who have been following those communities for a long period of time, have noticed an unusual increase, particularly compared to other areas. For the last thirty years, ICDDR,B has been running a health and demographic surveillance site in and around the coastal areas. Their study related to pregnant women revealed surprising information: women inland are less likely to miscarry than those in coastal regions. Between 2012 and 2017, ICDDR,B scientists registered 12,867 pregnancies in the region they monitored, which encompasses both the hill area and the plains. The team also kept the cohort of pregnant women under surveillance. Comprehensive maps generated using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) showed that pregnant women living within 20 km of the coastline and 7m above sea level were 1.3 times more likely to miscarry than women who live inland. The difference may not seem alarming at first, but given the long study period and the large size of the population studied, the results are indeed quite significant and consequential.  This fact is also evident from the Upazilla Health Complexes where physicians are increasingly treating patients with cardiovascular diseases like hypertension or stroke, along with pregnancy-related complications such as miscarriage, preeclampsia or eclampsia. Scientists who studied and compared pregnant women living near saltwater (Chakaria, Cox's Bazar) to those living near fresh water bodies (Matlab, Chandpur), also found a noticeable difference in miscarriage rate between the two groups. For example, in Chakaria, they found 11 percent of pregnancies ended in miscarriage, whereas in Matlab it was  much lower, around 8 percent. As miscarriage is related to events induced by the effect of extra salt intake, this difference is believed to have occurred due to the amount of salt in the water the women drink. So, in other words, the increase in miscarriages in coastal regions is caused by climate change. The rising sea level and its effects have become more prominent nowadays. With a one millibar decrease in atmosphere pressure, the sea level rises by ten millimeters. Environmental scientist Jonathan Gilligan, working on climate change in  Bangladesh, believes that our geography will naturally counter sea level rise until it becomes too rapid, and therefore unwieldy, due to climate change.  The world has seen the first climate change refugees already. During the 24th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP24) that took place late last year in Poland, the taskforce report on forced displacement due to climate change was optimised to give this issue greater prominence and importance. As a low-lying country full of flood plain land, Bangladeshi is particularly susceptible to changes caused by global warming. Some scientists from the western world are arguing whether more of the adverse effects of climate are human-induced or natural. But they should know that climate change knows no border. When humans are behind it, the solution is much more straightforward--we can address our own acts. But even if the risks are inevitable and natural, we can work to counter health-related risks. The best preparation for tomorrow is doing the best today.   Dr Maruf Hasan is a physician and researcher, working at Kurmitola General Hospital, Dhaka.

      "text": "The proposed national budget has offered 7.8 percent of total budget as climate financing in the coming fiscal, aiming at ensuring sustainable development, protection of environment, containing pollution, protection of biodiversity and tackling adverse impacts of climate change. In the current fiscal, the allocation was 8.1 percent. Experts, however, demanded that climate spending must be efficient, target-oriented and achieve actual impact of the public money spent on climate change.  Prof Ainun Nishat, noted climate change researcher, said considering the current state of affairs, the actual climate spending still remains a riddle due to a lack of clarity. Which development intervention is really dedicated to climate change is not clear, he added. \"Any climate spending must be factorised in development work to understand what actually has been done to tackle climate change,\" he said, adding, \"Over Tk 3,000 crore of the climate change trust fund has been spent over the past half-decade, but it is not clear what this public money has achieved in terms of combatting climate change.\" The proposed budget maintains that Bangladesh has been placed in the 6th position among countries vulnerable to natural disasters due to climate change. Therefore, the government has formulated an adaptive, long-term, integrated and macro-level mega plan called \"Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100\" with the vision of achieving a safe, climate change-resilient and prosperous delta. Implementation of the mega plan will require a huge investment of 2.5 percent of the GDP for flood control, preventing river erosion, river excavation, dredging, river training (structural measures taken to improve a river and its banks) and navigation. While appreciative of the government's allocation of climate financing, Tanjir Hossain, lead of Resilience and Climate Justice programme of ActionAid Bangladesh, said the civil society's demand has been allocation of a minimum 5 percent of the GDP for climate finance. So far, nearly half of the climate finance has been spent in the name of capacity building -- with a lion's share of the allocation to water resources, agriculture and disaster management ministries. \"But we have never seen an impact assessment of such spending; we do not know why expensive river embankments collapse regularly one after another,\" Tanjir Hossain said. To get the desired benefits of climate finance, it is crucial to examine whether fund allocation has been in keeping with the climate adaptation and mitigation goals, whether the proposed climate projects are consistent with the national climate action plan and how much money is needed for implementing the Delta Plan, added Hossain. Dr Saleemul Huq, director of International Centre for Climate Change and Development, spoke about the government initiative to incorporate climate financing in the national budget and to spend the fund through 25 designated ministries.  Capacity of these ministries has been enhanced with a UNDP project and they are now expected to be capable of identifying the areas of climate fund spending, he said.      \"Previously, we were not aware who was spending the funds and how,\" he said, \"But this time, the ministries are designated with specified areas of climate fund for relevant development works.\" Now, the success of the government's appreciable move depends on how the ministries' efficiency is reflected through identification of climate-related schemes, Dr Huq added."

Besides, the only radar in the divisional office, which cover eight northern districts,remained out of order for the last seven years. There are six meteorological offices at Rangpur, Dinajpur, Kurigram, Panchagarh and Nilphamari'sSaidpur and Dimlaupazilasin the division. Adverse impacts of climate change have triggered recurrence of natural disasters like storm, flood, drought and earthquake. It has become a major cause of concern and the recent cyclone Fani, which lashed the division, has focused on necessity of upgrading the weather offices with modern equipment and skilled manpower. Lokman Hakim, meteorological assistantin Saidpur office, said they collect dataon rainfall, highest and lowest atmospheric temperature, humidity, rate of water evaporation, air pressure, wind direction, velocity,upper wind observation and so on but cannot detect natural disaster directly which a radar can do. \"We have to use analogsystem equipment like rain gauge, wet and dry bulb thermometers, evaporation pan, soil thermometer, barometer and so on,\" he said, adding that if those are replaced with digital instruments, they would likely to give better results conveniently. Meanwhile, the only radarset up inthe divisional weather officehas remained out of order for the last seven years, he said. Mohammad Ali, assistant engineer of the office, saidJapan government set up the radar in 1999 which went out of order in 2005 as thunder bolt struck. After being repaired by Japanese experts, it worked well till 2012 and since then it is inoperative due to unavailability of spare parts, he said. MdMostafizur Rahman, assistant meteorologist, and also the in-charge of weather, radar and seismic observatory in Rangpur, saidthe government is going to set up ultramodern radarthere with technical support of Japan which will provide relevant data automatically."

The UN last week set a schedule to visit Bhashan Char to look at the safety features between November 17 and 19. \"The schedule for the visit will be fixed after we get the ToR,\" Shah Kamal said.  Joseph Surjamoni Tripura, spokesperson for the UN Refugee Agency in Dhaka, said the government and UN have agreed to postpone the visit to ensure that the right experts are on hand and all necessary logistical arrangements are in place. He didn't talk about the ToR required by the government, but said Bangladesh government and UN are discussing the next steps for the UN's assessment of Bhasan Char as a place to relocate the refugees. \"The UN is prepared to move forward with the initial assessment missions at the earliest possible date,\" Joseph said. The government took up a housing project in Bhashan Char after some 750,000 Rohingyas fled a brutal military campaign in the months following August, 2017, in Myanmar. The refugees joined 300,000 other Rohingyas who had fled previous waves of violence since the 1980s to Bangladesh. Government officials said destruction of forest, hills and risks of landslides in Cox's Bazar have prompted the authorities to build a temporary housing site for the Rohingyas on the 40-square km Bhashan Char, an island 37 miles from the coast of the Bay of Bengal. Disaster management ministry officials said that the project implemented by Bangladesh Navy has 120 cluster villages that are capable of accommodating 100,000 Rohingyas. The houses are built four feet above the ground with concrete blocks. The entire housing site is protected by a 13-km flood embankment.  There are also 120 cyclone shelters, which will also be used as schools, medical centres and community centres, they added. Shah Kamal said there are large swathes of land that could be used for livestock farming and fisheries in Bhashan Char. The refugees now live in crowded camps in Cox's Bazar where they have almost no work to do. \"We consider it a safe place for living. There will be education facilities as well,\" he said. Aid agencies say the island was isolated and flood-prone and put conditions that include a regular shipping service between Bhashan Char and the mainland. Late last month, Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner Mahbub Alam Talukder told reporters that some 6,000 to 7,000 refugees had expressed their willingness to be relocated to Bhashan Char. UN agencies then decided to send a technical mission to Bhashan Char. It intended to look at the risks of natural disasters, water supply, access to basic services, including health and education, and the freedom of movement within Bhashan Char and to and from the mainland, a UN official said. Technical experts from Bangladesh government would also accompany the UN mission to Bhashan Char, Senior Secretary Shah Kamal said, adding that he was expecting the UN mission to be satisfied by the facilities built for the Rohingyas. \"Once a group of Rohigya starts living there, I am sure, others will follow suit,\" said another official of the ministry.

The dyke on the western bank of the Brahmaputra river is also being used as a road connecting Tarapur, Belka, Kapasia, Chandipur, Sreepur and Kanchibari unions with Sundarganj upazila headquarters. So, the road always remains busy with movement of battery-run easy-bikes, tractors and motorcycles. Locals said the road has been in awful state as over 30 large and small ditches and cracks have developed on it, hampering smooth movement of vehicles. Due to heavy rainfall, the cracks and ditches are widening rapidly, they said. The situation turns worse at night when three-wheelers fell into the ditch due to reckless driving, said locals. The dyke may collapse anytime as floodwater started engulfing the area, they said, adding that any initiative is yet to be taken to renovate the breaching points of the dyke. Pedestrians, especially students, are the worst sufferers. Afsana Khatun, a student of Dhumaitari Fazil Madrasa, said they have to attend their madrasa taking risk while passing through the ditches filled with water.     ` Al Amin, an easy bike driver under Belka union, said it now takes about three hours to reach Sundarganj upazila bazar, whereas it was only an hour journey earlier. Nafiul Islam Jimy, chairman of Hariput union parishad (UP), said there are 10 large cracks and ditches created from BBC turning point to Panchpeer Bazar due to heavy rainfall, but no initiative is taken to repair the ditches. Ibrahim Khalillulah, chairman of Belka UP, said a large-scale ditch has developed at Dhumaitari point. Upazila Engineer Mohammed Abul Mansur said although the dyke is under the jurisdiction of Water Development Board, Local Government Engineering Department is also looking after the maintenance of road, so initiative for renovation of the road will be taken soon."

      "text": "If there were to be a name synonymous to fearless righteous rebellion and prolific emotional connections, that is Nazrul's, Bengal's romantic bidrohi. But to me, at least through his writings, he is a complete man. Be it his naughty child thief-self seeping through the rhymes of Lichu-chor, or the voice of a gentle soul disturbed by the daily troubles of a society's disenfranchised in Kuli-mojur, who then roars into rebellion to declare-- Ami shei din hobo shanto, jobey utpeeriter krondon-rol akash e batash e dhonibey na (I will rest when the screams of the suppressed no longer resonate in the air). He is also the romantic who binds the love of nature, and the adoration for his lady love in Mor priya hobe esho rani, debo khopa'y tarar phool (Let me make you a queen my dearest, with stars in your hair.) Or the aggrieved father, Shunno e-bukey pakhi mor aye firey aye, torey na heriya shokaler phool okaley jhoriya jae (Come back to my bereft heart, my little bird, the morning bloom withers too quickly for not seeing you), or Ghumiye geche shanto hoey more gaan-er bulbuli (My song-bird is sleeping quietly) ...    The most often and easily recognisable aspect of Nazrul, especially for the psyche of the Bengali nation, has been the unapologetic and unwavering rebel in him. Having lived through the waning sun of the British colonial rule in India, and after serving in the British troops in World War I, the poet emerged, rich in his experiences and learnings of languages, literature and music from his diverse battalion mates. Once back from service, in 1920, he became a journalist, his foray into literature truly began, in Kolkata. Even in that he was a trailblazer, introducing ghazals to Bangla, and adding words from other languages like Persian, which hitherto had not been done intentionally. But experiences or exposure alone could not make him the literary behemoth that he is today, or the inspiration that he was, throughout the fight, against the British, as well as the Liberation War. He personifies the common man, in our passions, in our tribulations, but grants our emotions the lucid expressions with eloquence we would be hard pressed to find otherwise. Especially when these emotions pertain to freedom from oppression and dignity of life. Forever in dissent, and clear in his position against the oppressive state in collusion with the often spineless native elite, he wrote while free, and while incarcerated, always the revolutionary. His spirit, and the depth of his emotions in these poems are universal in nature, just as oppression and human dignity are. And so, his poems consisting of a critique of the tyrannical social order, its categorical rejection, and then a call to arms, or protest, is a siren's song for all of lesser privilege, all around the world. He speaks for all those who work for and hope for a better world order, but even more vehemently, with a spirit that is not scared of sacrifice:   Have no fear! The flood deluge will soon overtake the universe. The final hour is fast drawing near. The rotting old and the dying decrepit will now be wiped out for good.   (Translation collected) Sublime romance \n With over 4,000 songs, and works in all sorts of mediums like short stories, novels, poems and plays, there is no lack of variety in the subjects that Nazrul has written on. Romance, in all its shades, has a muse in his works. In Tumi shundor tai cheye thaki, e ki mor oporadh-- he speaks unabashedly of the beauty of his beloved that holds his gaze transfixed.  In my limited study of the vastness of his words, I have found all the shades of emotions that lovers may go through over the course of a lifetime --young romance, desire, despondency, misery, agony and reminiscence of love and youth lost, and finally hope for the souls to unite or reunite as fate allows. Love in its first stages often has the feeling of inadequacy, from sheer wonder, and many lovers have lamented the limits of a human heart.  \"Ami eto j tomae bhalobeshechi Tobu mone hoy, e jeno kichui noy, Keno aro bhalobeshe jete parey na ridoy Ami eto j tomae bhalobeshechi\" Or the feeling of having known someone from some other time, like the connection of soulmates: \"Mora aar jonomey hongsho-mithun chilam Chilam Nodir chor-e Jugol-rup e eshechi go abar matir ghor-e\" (We were a pair of mated swans in another lifetime On a river island And have only returned as a couple to this mud-house.)   Or the gentle letting go of the lover, perhaps lost to situations unknown, with a hope of meeting again someday, somewhere: \"Porojonomey dekha hobe priyo, Bhulio morey hetha bhulio, E jonom-e jaha bola holo na, Ami bolibo na, tumio bolio na\" (Let us meet again, reborn Forget me here, now What is unsaid this time, let it remain, Let us not speak, neither you nor I.)   Or of broken hearts and dreams, and dejected agony; \"Hethay din er shopon raat e furay, Raat er kushun praat-e jhorey jae.\" (Dreams spun in the day die at night here, The blooms of the night wither at dawn.)   For each shade or nuanced emotion that love can evoke in a human being, Nazrul has felt it, and bestowed words on them for us to borrow when our own fall short.   Nazrul and the word 'freedom' Always guided by his tempestuous emotions, all his works have the quality to evoke emotions and egg us to make them unrestrained, unbound, to let the spirits be free, unbowed. This is true for his freedom exercised in the use of words, in the range of emotions given legitimacy and recognition to, and the way he picked and celebrated parts of all religions that he took a fancy to or was impressed by: \"Mora jhonjhar moto uddam Mora jhornar moto chonchol Mora bidhatar moto nirbhoy Mora prokritir moto shocchol.\"   In other works, he calls farmers to break free of the shackles that keep them oppressed, or for people to shed the burdens of old age, which he describes as not the years a person has lived, but rather, the readiness or reluctance to bring and accept change, specifically saying that he sees many ostensibly young people who are actually just worn out skeletons inside a farcically youthful skin. Perhaps it is time again that we read his poems for inspiration and strength alike, like we did during all our national crises--be it liberation from the British, or the Liberation War, let us be young again, let us live the Nazrul way, unbowed.

Quader, also road transport and bridges minister, was talking to reporters after visiting the head office of Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) in Motijheel area of Dhaka this noon. \"BNP will see whether Fakhrul has failed to meet the party's demand. We have no need to push our noses into the matter, Quader told a questioner. Claiming that Fakhrul belongs to a political party and thus he has to come up with many issues, Quader said, \"He (Fakhrul) does not speak like a residential representative of BNP. I did not hear any abusive speech in his face.\" BNP leaders have become vocal demanding change in their party's leadership after the December 30 national election, Quader last week said that Fakhrul should resign from the leadership of BNP if he is ashamed after the election. When asked about his remarks, Quader said, \"I gave a counter political speech on that day. It is BNP's own business whether it would change its leadership.\" Soon after the December 30 national election, BNP and Jatiya Oikyafront rejected the polls results bringing allegations of vote rigging, ballot stuffing and violence in the election. About the upcoming upazila election, Quader said, \"It is not an opportunity for BNP' rather it is its political rights whether it would take part in the election.\""

      "text": "Violent mobs in India's northeastern state of Assam torched buildings and clashed with police yesterday, leaving two dead and 11 with bullet wounds, as protests grew over a new citizenship law for non-Muslim minorities from some neighbouring countries. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government has said the Citizenship Amendment Bill, approved by parliament on Wednesday, was meant to protect minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The law seeks to grants Indian nationality to Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Parsis and Sikhs who fled the three countries before 2015. But thousands of protesters in the state of Assam, which shares a border with Bangladesh, say the measure would open the region to a flood of foreign migrants. Others said the bigger problem with the new law was that it undermined India's secular constitution by not offering protection to Muslims. Police in Assam's main city of Guwahati fired bullets and tear gas as groups of protesters, some numbering several hundred, demonstrated in the streets, defying a curfew imposed on Wednesday. Ramen Talukdar, superintendent of Gauhati Medical College Hospital, said two people had died from gunshot wounds and 11 others injured, also with bullet wounds. Indian news channel NDTV said the police firing caused the death of the protesters. Earlier yesterday, the government had extended the suspension of internet services in 10 districts of Assam for another 48 hours, and deployed army personnel in four areas where clashes between protesters and police were witnessed. Internet has been suspended in Tripura since Tuesday. A curfew was also to be imposed in parts of the capital city of the neighbouring state of Meghalaya, a government official said, because of fears of the law and order situation deteriorating. Five columns of the Army were conducting flag marches in Guwahati, Tinsukia, Jorhat and Dibrugarh, officials said. Several flights and trains to and from Assam have also been cancelled. Asom Gana Parishad headquarters in Guwahati's Ambari area was attacked by protestors and vehicles parked outside were vandalised, police said. Police said they had to open fire in Lalung Gaon area in Guwahati when stones were hurled by protestors opposed to the bill. Powerful All Assam Students Union, which had spearheaded prolonged violent agitation against illegal immigrants in late 1970s till 1985, and peasants' outfit Kisan Mukti Sangarsha Samiti called a gathering at Latashil playground in the city, which was attended by hundreds of people. Notwithstanding the curfew, several prominent personalities from Assam's film and music industry, including icon Zueen Garg, joined the gathering along with college and university students. \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal have betrayed the people of Assam by ensuring passage of the bill,\" AASU advisor Samujjal Bhattacharya said at the meet. Leaders of the AASU and the North East Students' Organization (NESO) said they will observe December 12 as 'Black Day' every year in protest against the passage of the bill in parliament. Modi yesterday took to the twitter to assure that he and his government were \"totally committed to constitutionally safeguard the political, linguistic, cultural and land rights of Assamese people as per the spirit of Clause 6\" of the 1985 Assam Peace accord. He also posted the comments in Assamese language. A complete shutdown hit Assam's Kamrup district yesterday with offices, schools, colleges and shops shut and no transport plying as all major roads. Tea garden workers stopped work in Lakhimpur and Charaideo districts and also at Numaligarh in Golaghat district and some areas in Tinsukia district. Protesters vandalised four railway stations in Assam and tried to set fire to them, a railway spokesman said. Train services were suspended, stranding scores of passengers. IndiGo said it had cancelled flights because of the unrest. In a major reshuffle, the Assam government yesterday replaced Guwahati Police Commissioner Deepak Kumar and Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Mukesh Agrawal in the state. Former Assam Chief Minister and Asom Gana Parishad leader Prafulla Kumar Mahanta said the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill is a \"divisive tool\" that will damage the composite culture of the northeast and must be immediately scrapped. The two-time Assam chief minister alleged the bill has been brought in to create a Hindu-Muslim divide. He said Assam will continue to \"burn\" if the Narendra Modi government does not realise the seriousness of the situation and respect the sentiments of the people. Mahanta also cautioned the Central government that the situation in Assam may take a \"dangerous turn\" and any delay in taking the right decision may cause unimaginable harm to the region. According to Mahanta, the current situation in Assam is worse than the early 1980s when the Assam movement led by him was at its peak. Over 600 student leaders lost their lives during the agitation between 1979 and 1985. The Aligarh Muslim University Teachers Association (AMUTA) dubbed the day of passage of the bill by the parliament as \"one of the darkest days\" in the history of independent India. The AMUTA passed a resolution stating that the passing of the bill marks a \"defeat for justice by the use of numbers game by the ruling party\"."

      "text": "River communications across the country came to a near halt yesterday as water transport workers and owners enforced strike and counter-strike that caused huge public sufferings. Although the workers postponed their \"work abstention\" for passenger vessels at 4:00pm and other vessels at 7:30pm, launch owners started their strike in the af-ternoon, protesting \"workers' repeated strikes\". This tussle between the workers and the owners caused immense sufferings to people of many southern districts as only a few launches operated from different terminals. Bangladesh Water Transport Workers Federation began their programme at 12:01am yesterday to press home their 11-point demand. Their demands include full implementation of the pay scale of 2016, stopping ex-tortion and robbery at vessels, and giving appointment letters and identity cards to transport workers. On April 16 this year, the federation had started work abstention to press home their 11-point demand, but called it off later following a meeting among the lead-ers of workers, owners and government officials. The meeting had decided that the demands would be met through discussions between all the stakeholders within the next 45 days, said Afsar Hossain Chowdhury, organising secretary of the federation, adding, \"We resume our work ab-stention today [yesterday] as our demands were not met.\" But the work abstention for passenger vessels was withdrawn at 4:00pm, considering people's sufferings, he said. He added that they held a meeting with AKM Mizanur Rahman, director general of Department of Labour, and withdrew their programme for all other vessels around 7:00pm. \"We have withdrawn our work abstention as the DG assured us of taking steps to solve the problem by August 30. Besides, we took flood, upcoming Eid and people's sufferings into consideration,\" Chowdhury Ashikul Alam, general secretary of the federation, told this correspondent last night. On the other hand, launch owners started their strike in the afternoon, halting operation of vessels, said Alamgir Kabir, joint director of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority at Sadarghat. Only eight to 10 launches left Sadarghat Launch Terminal as of 8:00pm, he said.  Badiuzzaman Badal, senior vice-chairman of Bangladesh Inland Waterways (pas-senger carrier's) Association, told The Daily Star that they started their strike around 2:00pm. Workers' salaries were increased 103 percent in 2016, but they are calling strikes repeatedly, citing different demands, which are \"illegal\", Badal said. \"We called the strike as they [workers] are tarnishing our image by calling strike time and again. We know people will suffer due to the strike, but we were forced to do it,\" he added.  He said their strike would continue unless the authorities took necessary steps barring workers from calling such \"illegal strike\" again. SUFFERINGS  Many people were forced to return home from Sadarghat Launch Terminal or go to their destinations by road due to the strike. Alamgir claimed people did not suffer much as many were aware of the strike. In the afternoon, our Barishal correspondent found that launch operations remained stopped on 18 routes from Barishal Launch Terminal. As a result, people returned from the terminal or waited there as they had no other options but to take river routes to reach their destinations. Jyotsna Begum, a housewife, went to the terminal to go to Bhola. \"I came to the launch terminal to go to Bhola for attending a family programme but failed,\" she told The Daily Star. Some were trying to reach their destinations using alternative ways, while some hired trawlers to do so, but this journey was risky as there were strong currents in the Kirtonkhola river. Around 50,000 people usually use launches to reach their destinations daily from the terminal, said BIWTA Deputy Director Ajmol Huda Mithu. Our Narayanganj and Munshiganj correspondents gave an almost similar picture of the situation. Babul Lal Baidya, deputy director of BIWTA in Narayanganj, said operation of launches on Narayanganj-Chandpur route was halted, although vessels operated on Narayanganj-Munshiganj and Narayanganj-Matlab routes. Launch operation on Shimulia-Kathalbari route was normal, but no long-route launches left Munshiganj."

      "text": "Considering that Dhaka city is gradually losing its wetlands, rivers and flood flow zones due to filling, encroachments and pollution, the High Court Division has recently given a verdict. In its verdict, the Court awarded the status of 'living entities' to all rivers of the country to ensure protection and to raise awareness of their environmental significance. It is not only Turag River which now has been endowed with a legal entity but the Court deemed the status applicable for all other rivers of the country. Since as living entities, the rivers now have the same rights as the human beings, they can sue any person threatening its existence. The suit may be filed by the government as a trustee of the rivers. Savar Upazila is situated in the North-West of the capital and is surrounded by Turag, Dhalweshwari, Buriganga, Bonghsi and Gajikholi rivers. Since Savar is adjacent to the capital, a good number of industries has been established surrounding the rivers that encircle Savar. The solid and liquid wastes produced by these industries without any form of filtration, get dumped into the wetlands and the cultivable as well as cultivated lands. Moreover, the industries in the EPZ are yet to have a central effluent treatment plant (ETP) to ensure discharge of harmless water. Considering that the living conditions in Savar has deteriorated due to indiscriminate waste dumping by  different industries, including the ones located in Dhaka Export Processing Zones (DEPZ), and the newly relocated tanneries, a public hearing took place on 3 April 2019 at Savar Golf Club Auditorium with the help of  Ministry of Forest and Climate Change and its Parliamentary committee, the German Embassy, Association for Land Reform and Development (ALRD), Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA), Bangladesh Poribesh Andalon (BAPA), Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB),  Nijera Kori, and Nodi O Poribesh Unnayan Parishad,  to protect the environment of Savar and to serve public interest. The Director General of Department of Environment (DoE), Dr. Sultan Ahmed stated in this public hearing  \" environmnetal friendly industrial factories must be formed. A taskforce must be formed soon to take actions against the industries that are in violation of the laws of the environment.\" He further added, \"there are millions of species in the world, and amongst them, the most harmful are people.  Buriganga has perished, Bongshi river is about to perish and for this; animals are not responsible, only humans are to be blamed.\" Rivers Bongshi, Turag, Dhaleshwari and various ponds and canals of Dhaka Savar are about to lose the last trace of their existence because of encroachment and pollution. Fishes are dying out and often found floating on the surface of the rivers. Jaundice, skin diseases, asthma, breathing difficulties and several other diseases are outbreaking amongst the local residents.   Filtration of the liquid wastes must be ensured and the boundaries of the rivers must be determined by using the C.S. Map to protect the rivers as soon as possible. Upon hearing all the complaints of the local residents of Savar at the public hearing, it was promised that the wastes dumped into the region will be removed within one to two months. The public hearing certainly gave us an array of hope and if the promises made are kept, it can truly be considered as a fruitful attempt.

      "text": "Almost all states now agree on the emerging threats to security from climate change, especially risks from sea-level rise to global peace and security. Bangladesh is no exception. In fact, Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries from the threats of sea-level rise. Sea-level rise (SLR) is a climate-induced and human-driven phenomenon. Growing population, increasing demand for natural resources, and rapid urbanisation are the major factors pushing sea-level rise to a risky extreme. Thermal expansion of water due to global warming remains one of the two main causes of SLR while the other is massive melting of ice sheets and glaciers. Scientists predict that even though the sea-level is estimated to rise 11 inches to 38 inches by 2100, a major breakup of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets can easily raise it up to 23 feet, creating a doomsday scenario. Low-lying regions around the world will suffer the most. For example, Bangladesh will lose a significant part of its territory to the rising sea, causing mass displacement of people. In the extreme case, island states like the Maldives and Papua New Guinea will disappear. Among all the regions, East Asia, Middle East, and North Africa bear the greatest relative impacts. Coastal areas will be severely affected. The most alarming news is that eight of the 10 megacities and many financial centres (i.e. New York, London, and Mumbai) in the world are situated in coastal areas which may be partially or completely lost due to SLR. This could cause global trade and the international financial system to face significant shocks. Supply chain management will also be adversely affected due to rising water levels in port cities like Rotterdam and Shanghai. Many small island developing states will face an existential threat due to the rise in sea-levels. Loss of wetlands will result in massive territorial shrinkage. Even before being submerged, the viability of these states will already be threatened, as often sea-level rise makes islands uninhabitable long in advance. Disputes over maritime boundary are very likely to take place as baselines and shorelines will move from its present longitudes and latitudes. With even the slightest change in lines, the current regime of maritime boundaries based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) will be obliterated. Confusion over coastlines and borderlines will also create disagreement over EEZs and territorial seas and access to ocean resources. These might threaten inter-state relations and make peace more difficult. Expansion of sea areas in habitat areas will displace hundreds of millions of people around the globe. Since 40-45 percent of the global population lives by the coast, the human loss and displacement is going to be enormous. Intra and inter-state migration will occur on a massive scale, which will eventually create an unhealthy distribution of populations. Lack of resources can further cause tension between host communities and migrants, which in extreme cases can even lead to the collapse of states. Regions already facing socio-economic tensions are likely to suffer more due to migration. Along with the loss of habitat, livelihoods will suffer too. Production of different sorts of crops will be halted and their quality can deteriorate due to salinised water. Hundreds of species of fish will be lost due to higher ocean temperatures, altered depth of water and associated changes in the chemistry of water. Similarly, many aquatic animal species will also be lost as the change in sea-level will affect their metabolism, functionality, ecosystem, growth rate, etc. Food security will be hampered to a great extent as we lose agricultural land to rising sea-level. Quality of the remaining agricultural land will also worsen with saline water intrusion. Salt water contamination will make irrigation difficult. Expected production of crops will go down drastically. Rice production is predicted to be reduced significantly due to delta areas such as those of the Mekong and Red River being submerged. This food insecurity among people will gradually build up to an unstable security situation within and beyond states. Water security will similarly be threatened due to hyper-salinisation of water. Due to melting of ice, water will submerge coastal areas. Different sources of water will be contaminated by salt water. Sweet water will be contaminated by the infusion of salt water. Energy infrastructures are highly vulnerable to sea-level rise. Nuclear reactors need uninterrupted water supply for cooling down the system which is why they are built near coastlines. Increased water levels will flood nuclear power plants which will affect the functionality of the reactors. The Fukushima power plant is a prime example, which in 2011's Tsunami was partly washed away in water and electricity supply was shut down, which prevented its regular functioning, causing radiation into the water and air. Destruction of coastal infrastructures will occur due to SLR. Port facilities, rail and road links, transmission facilities etc. will be heavily impacted. Capacity of coastal cities and states will decline severely as providing basic services to the population will become more difficult. Lack of services often aggravates the fragility of states. Higher sea-levels have the potential to flood terrestrial habitat. Greater tidal intrusion will change the salinity regime of coastal freshwater. Due to increased depth of the sea, marine life will be exposed to various threats like lack of sunlight, wave energy, and oxygen, which will adversely impact the marine ecosystem and will become an existential threat. Alteration in chemistry of soil caused by saltwater will also impact the coastal plant life. Economic impact on the tourism sector due to SLR will be devastating. Caribbean nations alone will see 149 multi-million-dollar resorts lost to rising sea-level. Price of available high-end beach properties will skyrocket. Huge disparity over the supply and demand of property will resurface allowing only a small portion of the population access to shelter. All these effects could easily add up to civil unrest and conflict. Multidimensional insecurity of people can make them vulnerable and prone to crimes and violence. Price hikes in the Middle East caused by a draught in Russia had sparked riots in Tunisia, which eventually contributed to the events of the Arab Spring. Impacts of sea-level rise can therefore have long range, non-linear, multi-directional implications. Especially, lack of access to sweet water can give rise to new conflict scenarios. Conflicts among nuclear-armed states will make the situation worse as seen in the case of India and Pakistan over the Indus water treaty. Weak governance, a common feature among the climate change-vulnerable countries, will aggravate the internal anarchy. Reversing completely the process of sea-level rise is not achievable. Some of the impacts of rising water level are inevitable. Hence, rather than focusing on reversing the process, the practical and attainable course of actions will be to mitigate it with the objective of preventing further aggravation.

On January 11-12, experts from 13 universities, 41 organisations and foreign countries accepted a 40-point proposal during \"Conference on Delta Plan 2100 and Sustainable Development\" held in Dhaka. To publish the proposal, Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (Bapa) and Bangladesh Poribesh Network (BEN) held the press conference at Dhaka Reporters' Unity. Dr Abdul Matin, general secretary of Bapa, read out the proposal. Although the conference welcomed the BDP initiative, it said there are some major weaknesses in it. The proposal stated that it is surprising to select 80 projects out of 123 for implementation in 2018-2030, as they were selected by \"a group of implementing agencies\". At the press conference, Dr Abdul Matin said they do not disagree with the government's plan, rather would like the incompleteness, flaws and limitations of the BDP addressed. \"If the authorities accept the list of projects from the implementing agencies, questions will be raised about the objective of BDP,\" the proposal added. At the press conference, Bapa Vice President Khandaker Bazlul Haque urged the government to scrutinise the delta plan further. Sharif Jamil, joint secretary of Bapa, said, \"There was a need to collect and scrutinise more data in adopting the delta plan... I think review of the project is very much needed.\" Prof M Firoz Ahmed, co-chairperson of Bapa, said, \"The geographies of the Netherlands and Bangladesh are not the same. So, it will not be viable to adopt delta plan based on their recommendations.\" Environment academics, experts, researchers from different institutions and activists from environment organisation were present at the press conference. According to Planning Commission, the government will implement the 100-year long Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 in three phases which include a short-term plan by 2030, a mid-term plan by 2050, and a long-term plan by 2100."

Speaking at a press conference in the capital's Jatiya Press Club, he claimed that the insecticide currently being used to kill mosquitoes is not effective.   \"Ineffective insecticide has been bought only to provide unfair privileges to a company, though various newspapers in the last two-three years published reports about it,\" he said, adding that the authorities concerned are yet to import effective insecticide. Citing the prime minister's directive on dengue, he said, \"If the prime minister directive is needed in such a case, then there is no moral right for the two mayors of Dhaka and the health minister as well as others concerned to hold their posts.\" He said that neighbouring West Bengal has set a good example of preventing dengue fever while Bangladesh has set an example of failure in the case.    \"Rather, the government is illogically blaming opposition parties to cover their negligence,\" he claimed. Manna demanded free treatment for dengue patients and regular anti-mosquito operations in every union across the country. Citing severe sufferings of flood affected people in the country, he said some 120 persons have died due to the government's failure to  provide adequate relief and treatment for waterborne diseases. Manna alleged that incidents of rape are on rise as rapists are sheltered by the ruling party leaders and even by law enforcers, instead of being brought to book. He demanded exemplary punishment for the murderers of Nusrat in Feni and Rifat in Barguna. He condemned a government official's threat against Dhaka University Prof ABM Faroque, who claimed to have found antibiotics in pasteurised milk of several brands. \"The government should have given him [Prof Faroque] an award for his research rather than threatening him, which is shameful,\" Manna said. He urged the ruling party to uphold democratic values instead of torturing opposition leaders and activists."

      "text": "Nearly 60 meters of Kunimura-Tarapasha road on the Manu river flood control embankment has been eroded by the river in Moulvibazar's Kulaura upazila on Thursday. As the erosion devoured a large number of stores at Kawkapon Bazar, an age-old market along the road, inhabitants of nearby villages have been moving away to safety, fearing further damage to the embankment. Elderly storeowner Salahuddin said after losing his variety store that his grandfather started, he was worried whether the entire embankment will now disappear into the river.       \"We took shelter on the embankment after losing our croplands and homesteads to the river's erosion before and we are now worried if the embankment itself will be lost,\" said Nurul Islam of the same area. Abdul Basit Bachchu, chairman of Hajipur Union Parishad, said playgrounds, tube wells as well as 36 shops on the riverside of the 100-year-old market had been eroded by the river last year. About one-third of the 180-meter-long levee has partially collapsed on Thursday and if it breaches completely this time, thousands of bighas of farmlands and orchards in at least 20 villages will disappear, he added.  President of Kawkapon Bazar association Porimol Chandra Dey said the loss sustained by storeowners due to erosion this time might be around Tk 1 crore.  Another leader of the traders, the association's General Secretary Mokhlesur Rahman, said the government gets revenue from the market every year. But the Water Development Board's (WDB) hasty repair work on the levee, with sandbags and bamboo, was washed away by the river's strong current from upstream. Unless a proper repair work is done, the market as well as a large area protected by the embankment will be devoured by the river, he also said. Contacted, WDB Assistant Engineer in Moulvibazar Abdul Kader said they were aware that the road on the levee sustained severe damage and many of the stores along its side were washed away. The WDB was undertaking a fresh project to do all necessary work for protecting the embankment in Kawkapon Bazar area, he added."

The project will also focus on enhancing knowledge and increased participation of adolescent boys and girls on community-based disaster risk reduction. The agreement was signed in Dhaka yesterday by Arshadul Mukaddis, executive director in-charge, Bangladesh Scouts; and Edouard Beigbeder, Unicef Bangladesh representative, said a Unicef press release. \"UNICEF emphasizes on empowering adolescent as agents of change. We believe that young people must be involved in identifying and implementing solutions to address the challenges facing adolescents and youths. Implementing solutions for adolescents can be enhanced through use of innovative platforms and tools.\" said Edouard Beigbeder. The activities under this initiative include trainings on life skill based education, online safety and disaster risk reduction. Through this initiative, the Scout members will also have access to and connect through online platforms such as U-Report and social media to gather opinions of children and young people on issues affecting them, enhance their knowledge on child rights, take up challenges, and be engaged in community development. The initiative will be implemented in   Satkhira, Sunamganj, Patuakhali and Cox's Bazar; and in Sylhet and Dhaka, considering potential hazards such as flood, cyclone and earthquake. \"This new partnership with Bangladesh Scouts will promote their broader engagement in various initiatives to address children and adolescent issues, while deepening the capacity of Scouts in targeted locations in disaster risk reduction,\" said Edouard Beigbeder."

      "text": "The art exhibition, Breaking Ground: Modern Art in Transition, organised by Bengal Shilpalay, opens today at Subir Choudhury Exhibition Hall in Dhanmondi. Riva Ganguly Das, the High Commissioner of India in Dhaka, will inaugurate the exhibition as the chief guest. Renowned artist Professor Nisar Hossain, Dean, Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka, will attend the event as the special guest. Breaking Ground: Modern Art in Transition will conclude on February 15, 2020.   The exhibition showcases the works of modern and pioneering Bangladeshi and Indian artists in a new light. Bengali modernism was a contextual practice drawn from the subcontinent's traditions of courtly and folk art, as well as lessons of the various modern and contemporary creative movements from the West. The artists from the region explored tradition, reviving ancestral forms and incorporating a rich folk culture into their works, to come up with a fine balance between tradition and modernity. Rural landscapes, geographies, people, and their connection with nature's nuances and dimensions played an important role in defining the artists' approach. The geometric organisation of forms were often replaced by organic sensibilities, through which sharp, precise and definite shapes were transformed into soft, free forms and earthy expressions. The exhibition aims to introduce the aesthetic leanings of early practices, which led to the wave of modernism in art in this part of the world. The featured artists of the exhibition are Aminul Islam, Gaganendranath Tagore, Jamini Roy, Kazi Abdul Baset, Mohammad Kibria, Murtaja Baseer, Qayyum Chowdhury, Quamrul Hassan, Ramkinkar Baij, Rashid Choudhury, Safiuddin Ahmed, S M Sultan and Zainul Abedin. The team behind the exhibition selected an array of works from the rich collection of Abul Khair, the Chairman of Bengal Foundation, and included works of influential modernist forerunners from the 1930s onwards. Tanzim Wahab, the curator of the exhibition, inspired several talented research associates of the Bengal Arts Programme to engage in their creative endeavours and inputs to successfully showcase the artworks. Priyanka Chowdhury, a research associate of the exhibition, recently gave The Daily Star team a guided tour of the show. Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin's Tea Stall and S M Sultan's painting on the 1970 cyclone are two of the rare paintings on exhibit at the event. A mother is seen suckling her baby, while a heap of corpses is amassed at the offshore in Monpura, Bhola, in S M Sultan's cyclone painting. The digital display of uncommon sketches and drawings by several featured artists, together with the books, magazines, photographs and antique crafts attribute a unique quality to the exhibition. The audience will have the opportunity to revisit old times by going through the Kherokhata (diaries) of Quamrul Hassan, a book of letters and essays by Jamini Roy, a book titled Ramkinkar, a special issue of Kali O Kalam on Mohammad Kibria and rare photos of the master painters, among other things, at the exhibition. \"Abul Hasnat, Editor of Kali O Kalam, contributed the books for the exhibition, while Luva Nahid Choudhury, Director General of Bengal Foundation, provided her collection of Kazi Abdul Baset's artworks,\" mentioned Priyanka Chowdhury. \"Quamrul Hassan's famous sketches, one of his portraits by Nasir Ali Mamun and photographs describing his participation in various socio-political movements with texts, are also on display. We are also installing three videos on S M Sultan, Gaganendranath Tagore and Murtaja Baseer.\" Upon entering the gallery, the view of Rashid Choudhury's life-sized tapestry will marvel the visitors. Safiuddin Ahmed's shimmering prints, titled On the Way to the Fair and Flood, along with his captured and developed photographs, his book published by Skira and Bengal Foundation and a rare sketch book, coupled with its digital display, are also on exhibit. In addition, beautiful paintings and illustrations by Qayyum Chowdhury, masterpieces by Mohammad Kibria, Aminul Islam's rare paintings and Safiuddin Ahmed's unique oil paintings are some of the many notable works at the exhibition.

The authorities concerned have been given instruction not to allow any cattle markets on roads and highways ahead of the occasion, Quader said. The minister further said heavy vehicles like trucks and lorries will not be allowed on the highways before and after three days of the Eid to be celebrated in the second week of August. But the ban will not be applicable on the vehicles carrying medicine and other daily necessities, Quader said. About the recent incidents of mob beating, the minister said he had already talked with the home minister in this regard. \"Measures will be taken so that this kind of incidents cannot be repeated,\" he said. While talking on Priya Saha, Quader said she will have to clarifies her statement once she returns to the country. Priya, one of the organising secretaries of Bangladesh Hindu-Bouddha-Christian Oikya Parishad, drew huge criticism after she told US President Donald Trump that 37 million people from religious minorities have \"disappeared\" from Bangladesh."

He, however, said Bangladesh has already been considered as a role model in the management of natural disasters and noted that the country has achieved \"tremendous success\" in addressing the impacts of climate change. The foreign minister was addressing the inaugural session of annual thematic meeting of the Platform on Disaster Displacement (PDD) held in a hotel in Dhaka. The theme of the event is \"Striving together for addressing displacement due to slow and sudden-onset disasters\". M Nojibur Rahman, principal secretary to the prime minister, Senior Secretary, Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief M Shah Kamal and Ambassador of France in Dhaka Marie-Annick Bourdin, among others, spoke at the inaugural session. The foreign minister laid emphasis on joint efforts to address the issues related to climate change and disasters as one single country cannot do it alone. Bangladesh as the current Chair of the PDD in collaboration with International Organization for Migration (IOM) is hosting the event. The meeting is exploring issues related to human mobility -- displacement, migration and planned relocation -- in the context of both sudden-onset disasters like tropical cyclones, tidal bore, tsunami, earthquake, landslide and volcanic eruption. It is also exploring slow-onset events and processes like sea level rise, river erosion, salinity, flood, drought, many of which are inter-related and are results of environmental degradation due to climate change. The meeting is also discussing how protection can be best ensured for displaced persons and persons at risk of displacement, including through effective disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in national, regional and international levels. State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shahrial Alam and State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Dr Md Enamur Rahman are scheduled to take part in the closing session of the event. Senior Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Md Shahidul Haque will be chairing the meeting. Over a hundred participants representing governments of the Steering Group of the Platform on Disaster Displacement, participants from other governments as well as representatives from regional and international organizations, UN Agencies, civil society organisations and research institutions are attending the event.

      "text": " On January 28, the High Court ordered 38 housing projects around Purbachal New Town to temporarily stop all land-related activity being conducted. To be more specific, this activity included plugging up water-bodies, filling lowlands with sand, and clearing out vegetation.  \"The High Court ordered the companies to maintain the status quo of things. Meanwhile the government was asked to investigate the projects and find out whether they are all in compliance,\" says advocate Manzill Murshed, the Supreme Court lawyer who filed the writ petition. The companies and/or housing projects mentioned in the petition (and a subsequent follow-up application to the court) include United Purbachal Lands Limited, AG Property Limited, Navana Real Estate, Biswas Builders Limited, Nilachal Housing Limited, Bagan Bilash, Rupayan Lands Limited, Adarsha Ideals Limited, Tepantar Housing, Metropolitan Christian Cooperative Housing, Gramph International Ltd, North South Housing Ltd,  Manjil Housing and Development Limited, Shikder Royal City Ltd, Kapatakkha Green City, Divine Holding Limited, Shatabdi Housing Ltd, Swarna Chaya Real Estate, Vision 21 and Development Limited, Ocean Heaven Limited, SFL Chandrima Limited, Fare Deal Shipping Limited, Platinum Purbachal City, City Cloud 9, Canada City, Jamidar City, Rimjhim Police Town, Dreamland, Homeland Purbachal City, Hometown Purbachal City, Pretty Real Estate, Mascot Green City, Puspita Empire Housing, Nandan City, Purbachal Bestway City, Malum City, Marine City and Shopun City. The kickback is that many of these real-estate projects have already divided up the lands into residential plots and sold them off to people. Star Weekend talked to three such individuals who booked plots with two different companies--Purbachal Marine City and Biswas Builders--and these are now stuck in a limbo. A quick glimpse through the company listings on different classified pages show that these plots sold for--or are selling for--upwards of Tk 2 lakh per katha. For most companies, the smallest sized residential plot would be 3 katha, meaning that customers invested a minimum of Tk 6 lakhs each.  They are now held up as the companies enter what will potentially be a long-drawn battle at the court. The High Court judgment comes at a time when many of these plots are just a few formalities away from handover. Some are still at the point of inception and exist in their natural state either as grassy turf, or ponds or paddy fields, but others have visibly morphed into huge fields of dry white sand that occupy miles upon miles.  One customer we spoke to for example, is down to signing her last cheque for a plot in Purbachal Hill City. An aerial view of the satellite city being built by Biswas Builders shows neatly laid out residential squares, each just big enough for a house, with driveways leading up to each of the blocks. Another buyer informs us that his plot too is almost ready to be handed over. It exists inside a humongous walled-off compound, with a steel gate manned by a security guard. The compound has almost entirely been cleared of vegetation, the existing land has been filled in with sand such that the whole area resembles a large white sand-field. But it is when you pull up a satellite image of what the area looked like in 2011 that you realise how truly green it was. There were at least five greyish-green squares with clumps of floating vegetation, indicating that there were possibly shallow swamps. Of these, only one remains right now, as a pond in the middle of the estate. A lone pink water-lily plant--made up of only three flat leaves and a dwarf-sized flower--floats on the surface. Yet all of this was cleared without an environmental clearance. \"We applied for the environmental clearance, but we are yet to receive it,\" says Captain Shah Alam, managing director of Purbachal Marine City. An environmental clearance application was made in November 2018. Unfortunately, historical Google Earth images show that the project began as early as 2014. When asked why plots were sold without obtaining an environmental clearance first, Alam states that because of the sheer length of time needed to get all the necessary permits from different government offices, it is not feasible for developers to get all documents in order before selling plots. \"The Marine City is not located in the conservation zone earmarked in Rajuk's Detailed Area Plan (DAP). There are no lowlands within our project. In fact, there is nothing called a lowland. DAP identifies whether or not a land is a flood flow zone or a pond, and ours did not have either,\" says Alam. He even produced a letter from Rajuk stating the same. Unfortunately, this is a catch-22 situation--the project is based off of the rules set by DAP, but DAP's demarcations themselves are not without question either. In 2015, The Daily Star reported that the DAP was altered to remove several places in Rupganj (where Purbachal is located), from 'flood-flow zones' to normal lands for development. The decision by Rajuk drew huge flak from environmental experts concerned about environmental disasters and water-logging. Demarcated or not, when walking about Rupganj, one can see where flood waters collect during the rainy season. These are the patches of land with watercress and taro beds growing abundantly. Some still have pools of stagnant water with ducks wading through. Some have large discarded concrete pipes lying on the side--of no use during the winter, but clearly used during monsoon. Ironically, projects built on higher ground are so few in number that they are actually using it as an advertising tagline. Purbachal Adarsha City made a Facebook video advertisement where they claim that they stand out from other projects because they are not built on lowland. \"You can save up to Tk 40 lakhs on building expenses because you do not need to build deep foundations!\" exclaimed the presenter in the social media ad. Star Weekend went through the Department of Environment's (DoE) environmental clearance committee's meeting minutes of the years 2018, and 2012 to 2015, all of which are publicly available on their website. Only the names of Purbachal Bestway City, Purbachal Malum City and Purbachal Hill City came up in the minutes as companies that had applied for environmental clearances. We requested official sources at the DoE to cross check the other projects mentioned in the petition with the records of 2016 and 2017 since those were not publicly available. Upon doing so, they found that none of them have environmental clearances. The sources declined to go on-record because of the on-going court investigation into the projects. Abul Fatteh Mohammed Shafiqul Islam, the Upazila Nirbahi Officer of Rupganj, Narayanganj did go on record though, and stated that \"None of the land projects mentioned in the writ petition can be called legal since they do not have their permits in order.\" \"This is the list of permits the companies need to take: they need to first get a no-objection certificate from the paurashava mayor; then they need to get a permit from the National Housing Authority; following which they need to get cleared by DoE, and even Bangladesh Road Transport Authority. Lastly, they need to get a no-objection certificate from the district commissioner's office,\" describes UNO Shafiq. He goes on to say that none of the companies have all these documents. \"We haven't given anyone a no-objection certificate in the last year and a half because they don't have an environmental clearance yet,\" he says. \"I made a list of 60 plus companies like this,\" he adds, \"and most of them did not even apply to our office for the no-objection certificate. I myself rescued over 500 bigha of khas lands and wetlands from these projects that they had sold off to other people.\" \"People's lands are forcefully being filled in with sand and we have to go stop it. The sand-filling is done in a covert way--say, you sold your land, but the plot next to yours could not be bought. When the developer fills in your plot with sand, they will also let it spill over to the neighbouring plot, thereby occupying it,\" describes Shafiq. Gopal Chandra Das is one farmer who is on the verge of losing his land in a similar way. His plot is just a stone's throw from Zinda Park, and at the time when this correspondent saw it, it was completely submerged under and overrun with kochuripana weeds. \"This is the land I used to harvest rice on. Unfortunately, I cannot anymore because it is permanently waterlogged. When the land companies filled up their plots with sand, they blocked off all the irrigation channels through which water could not only flow in, but also flow out,\" he says. When talking to this correspondent, the man was waist-deep in a plot submerged underwater clearing out kachuripana. \"Since I cannot harvest rice anymore, I had to buy chickens but it is never enough money. Now I am thinking of selling a bit of the land that cannot be used anymore,\" laments the man. Harijur Rahman, the executive engineer from National Housing Authority (NHA) also claims, \"We did not give permissions for any land projects around Purbachal New Town.\" This claim is astounding seeing that when travelling from the 300-feet road all the way to Kaliganj, Gazipur the entire landscape is littered with signboards of different land projects. One cannot go a few feet without seeing such a signboard. \"These signboards are everywhere. NHA must seriously investigate how these companies have set up shop without a single permit from the housing authority,\" says Moqbul Hossain, the former Member of Admin and Finance and NHA. How do these cities sell plots without having all necessary permits? \"They use a legal loophole. The plots are not sold as housing project plots--meaning the land deed is never transferred to the housing project's name. It is directly transferred from the person whose land is being bought (e.g. the farmer) to the company's customer booking the plot. There is no law barring one individual from transferring their land to another individual,\" explains Shafiq. It is true--Star Weekend scrutinised several land deeds of plots booked from these housing companies and found the names of the companies mentioned nowhere on the list. The deeds simply noted that a piece of land was exchanging hands from one individual to another. The housing projects essentially acted as middlemen during the land deed transfer process. DEjA vu \"Last year there was a similar problem with Rimjhim Police Town and Italian City. The projects were permanently stopped by the High Court,\" says Shafiq. Housing projects getting decommissioned at the last minute is not a new thing, in Rupganj or elsewhere. Perhaps the most infamous of these cases were Modhumoti Model Town and Ashiyan City. In 2017, the High Court barred Ashiyan City from continuing development. Rights groups including Ain O Salish Kendra, Association for Land Reforms and Development, Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust, Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon, Institute of Architects Bangladesh, Nijera Kori, and Paribesh Bachao Andolon fought the court battle to maintain Dhaka's flood flow zones. The land project situated right outside Dakshinkhan now exists as a completely barren zone devoid of people. Even before that, in 2012, the apex court of the country ruled Modhumoti Model Town illegal. The judgment stated that the residential project that is spread out over Savar was built upon flood flow zones and hence cannot be allowed to continue. This ruling was based on a writ petition filed by BELA in 2004--meaning it took the court a whole eight years to pull the plug, by which time the project had sold most of its plots. Dr Firoze, an eye doctor by profession, is one person who lost investments during the Modhumoti Model Town fiasco, and may potentially lose out again this time. He booked a plot at Purbachal Hill City by Biswas Builders, which is one of the companies mentioned in this recent High Court order. \"I had invested in some land in Modhumoti Model Town. When it was declared illegal, the money was never returned to us,\" he says, \"and even now, when we call the office to get our money back, they tell us that everything will be okay. Let's see what happens this time. I'm guessing I'm going to lose this money as well.\""

As a result, the most expensive football club is no longer Real Madrid, but our very own Fakirapool Young Men's Club. So, why go to Las Vegas? Now, What Happens in Fakirapool, Stays in Fakirapool...Panir Tanki! No wonder Bangladesh is 208th in the FIFA ranking--our football clubs are busy practicing football with Lilliput sized roulette balls. Slot machines are breeding like Aedes mosquitoes. No wonder we can't find any cash at any of the omnipresent ATMs in Gulistan. But thanks to the flood of cash flowing around the casinos there, the five dozen banks in the country can forget those ATMs and just set up branches at the glitzy joints. Gulistan is the new Las Vegas Strip. Seeing so many casinos, guess who may just show up in town--President Donald Trump! He will make Gulistan great again by building a H-E-E-E-U-U-G-E wall around it. And you know who's going to pay for it? Fakirapool! But we, the average sports enthusiasts, are hurt. Our beloved sports clubs have been besmirched at the roll of a dice. But why? Were the sporting clubs looking to diversify their portfolios beyond football and cricket by getting into \"indoor\" sports? Or was it that there was a bid for Gulistan to be the location for the next 007 movie Casino Loyal (to the few) or the nearby Fakirapool being ground zero for From Fakirapool with Love? Or was it that just as matches between Barca and Real Madrid are known as El Clasico, we had this wild urge of coining the matches between Mohammedan and Victoria Sporting as El Casino? No. It's chi-ching. Duh! Money talks. It can sing and dance and it can walk. In fact, it can even roll the dice. Let's not also forget that it is an addiction. And if we really had to go all out to satiate this obsession, did we really need casinos? Don't we have an infinite list of items to bet on? The moment we open our eyes in the morning, we enter the world of the virtual casino--we gamble with the tainted milk at breakfast, we bet in dodging the Aedes without applying the unaffordable Odomos.  As we hit the road, we gamble on not getting hit by a UFO (Unruly Fast Object). We gamble on \"an apple a day, keeps the doctor away\" with the formalin laden apple, prompting the doctor to actually show up. We wave our hands frantically like the arm of a slot machine while jay walking, expecting all incoming traffic to come to a screeching halt because, we, our royal highnesses, are too lazy to take the foot over bridge. And last, but not the least, there is the highest probability of asking this question: \"During the morning rush hour, how many hours will it take to go from Sadarghat to Uttara?\" Ok, now what is the number of possible options as answers to this question? See? Even the roulette doesn't have that many section bets (slots). Casinos are illegal. Hence the stakes here are twice as high--there is the risk of losing and the risk of getting caught. Therefore, gambling in Bangladesh is a gamble. And if one really gets caught at the casino, he can just play dumb: \"Oh, I came here to audition for Who will be Masud Rana\". But the irony of it all is that despite Dhaka having so many casinos, all that dough from Bangladesh Bank, located not too far away from all the action, had to end up at casinos so far away in Manila... Well, the legendary names of Mohammedan, Victoria will never be the same. The only consolation, Badda Jagoroni now has a shot at winning the Premier League as many of the other clubs have been busy with casinos, playing Russian Roulette, literally...

Add to that with the sweet musk of new books is something most love. Plus, shopping for books in Nilkhet is more cost-effective than a dinner in Dhanmondi. Yet, every heaven on earth has its perils. Nilkhet is no different. Dangers will lurk around you in every 'Mama, ki lagbe?' Let's gloss over a few and see how we can circle our ways around them. Right off the bat, the biggest danger you have to face is being offered a book at a price that would be 10 times more than it cost them to make a book. If you do not bargain with the shopkeeper, you are bound to have the Bengali 'Mama thoksen' tag stuck on your forehead. To counter that, give them a counter-offer so low that even you would feel ashamed of being offered. For example, telling the shopkeeper that you would buy a book for 70 taka when you're pretty sure it costs at least 130 taka to print. The shopkeeper will be ascertained of your dominance and bargain with you in a respectful manner. Nilkhet is a huge place, with roads leading into dead ends, the streets, or Narnia. Navigating your way through these areas is not easy. But always remember, you are doing it for a better cause: A new book to read (or to fulfil course requirements). To navigate your way through Nilkhet, bring a compass, a pencil with an eraser, a ruler, a divider to portray accurate measurements, and a big piece of paper to make a map out of. Walk your way around Nilkhet so that you can make your precious map. Because there's no other way around this issue. Unless you can remember the narrow, identical roads inside using the shops that look all-alike as landmarks. There's that too. Your shoes and clothes will meet their untimely demise in the Nilkhet flood. I'm sorry, there's no way out of this one. Nilkhet is notorious for its crowded narrow scantily-clad brick streets (we do notice concrete narrow streets nowadays, so there's an upgrade). Come admission season, you would easily confuse Nilkhet with Gabtoli during Eid-ul-Azha, minus the cow manure everywhere. Counter this by mustering all your inner strength and plowing down anyone in front of you. Channel your inner bull. Show no mercy. Stop only when you get to the shop you've been looking for over half-an-hour. What's your excuse? That you're a sack of potatoes? Well the heavier you are, the more inertia you have. Run and plow like no other being. You will come across books with poorly printed content. Either the text will be lightly printed, or some pages will remain completely blank. Now the sane thing to do here would be asking the shopkeeper to give you a better copy. But this is Nilkhet. Sanity is not an option. Throw a tantrum that your book came out to be badly printed. Bonus points if you curse. The shopkeeper will surely listen to your every word now. These are just a few dangers that were addressed here. You will find your way through many more hazards. But never forget. You are a Bangladeshi. If you can parkour your way through the streets everyday, you can do anything.   Aka is a tiny bleep on the world's radar, and he finds peace in knowing it.

      "text": "Bangladesh, which has been stigmatised in many respects as a peripheral region, has hardly been present on the global architectural map. However, this is likely to change in the near future, because of the work of Bangladeshi architect and founder of URBANA, Kashef Chowdhury. Kashef Chowdhury's buildings - such as his storm-proof school or island-shaped village near the Bramaputra River - seem to have emerged directly from the local context of Bangladesh. His work has universal appeal, spanning space and time from east to west, from the past to the present. His implementation of light, space and materiality in his work is powerful. URBANA's works are not only spatially and architecturally extraordinary in their immediacy, they also bear witness to the high social relevance. They thoughtfully address grave issues such as population density, climate change, migration etc. Bangladesh's urban centres, such as Dhaka and Chattogram, are rapidly expanding under the pressures of rural exodus. Kashef Chowdhury wants to find new strategies that offer the rural population a sense of security and identity. He is aware that improvement of rural living conditions can halt the seemingly unstoppable flow of rural emigration, and with it, the collapse of urban regions. Bangladesh's river delta landscape is an area prone to flooding, cyclones, and rising sea levels. In this context, URBANA's buildings reveal a permanence based on clear geometries, local materials, and vernacular building methods. With the first comprehensive European exhibition, the Aedes Architecture Forum presents the work of Kashef Chowdhury. He received the prestigious Aga Khan Award in 2016, for the Friendship Centre on the flood plains of Gaibandha in northern Bangladesh. With projects such as the Gulshan Society Mosque in Dhaka and the Cyclone Shelter in Kuakata, he gained widespread international acclaim. Kashef Chowdhury's buildings are carefully arranged in areas marked by extreme climatic conditions. At the same time they are combined with local building techniques and material. Hosted in Berlin, the exhibition documents more than a dozen buildings and projects by means of models, photographs, film footage, and plans, that provides a kaleidoscopic view of the studio's design and construction processes. It invites visitors on a journey to Bangladesh and the architectural worlds of URBANA. The exhibition, curated by Niklaus Graber and Andreas Ruby, opened on January 25 and will continue till March 6."

      "text": "The Rohingya influx into Bangladesh, described by the United Nations (UN) as the \"world's fastest growing refugee crisis,\" has been one of the most discussed humanitarian crises of recent times. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Bangladesh, prior to the latest exodus, had already been hosting more than 300,000 Rohingya refugees. The latest mega settlement of Kutupalong-Balukhali, with a population of over 600,000 in Ukhia, Cox's Bazar, was built swiftly within five months. More than 90 percent of the camp population live below the UNHCR emergency standards of 45 square metres per person and at some areas as low as 8 square metres. The overcrowding poses several environmental (e.g. deforestation, contamination), economic (e.g. impact on the host community's economy, reducing the average wage) and health (e.g. epidemics) risks. Considering the speed and scale of the crisis, the initial response of the host country and humanitarian aid organisations was to provide basic support to the refugees. However, the influx has decreased and the timeline for a safe and Rohingya-approved repatriation back to Myanmar remains unknown. Moreover, the Bangladesh government should rethink how to maintain medium- to long-term support to the Rohingya population in a more structured way while addressing host community needs. The Bangladesh government had proposed relocating the Rohingyas to the coastal areas in 2015--specifically, to Bhasan Char (originally known as \"Thengar Char\") in Noakhali. Recent details of government-approved infrastructure reportedly include 120 plots of land (each containing 12 buildings housing 16 families in a 12-foot by 14-foot unit with shared kitchens and bathrooms), one cyclone shelter and a 2.47m high embankment-flood barrier. At present, talks about Bhasan Char have softened into whispers. There is no telling when the plans may resurface. Thus, a frank discussion exploring risks and vulnerabilities is necessary. The geographical setting, scarcity of proper infrastructure and isolation from the mainland impede the functioning of administration, and services such as law enforcement, economic participation, health and education are very limited.   Initially, the relocation idea immediately received scrutiny from the public and organisations such as the UN and Amnesty International. The criticism stems largely because of Bhasan Char's exposure to natural disasters. This scepticism is anticipated as many are unfamiliar with the char lands. In Bangladesh, close to three million people live on 185 fertile silt islands, known as chars, which are formed by the dynamics of river erosion and accretion. The chars are low-lying areas and the soil is of high salinity. Initially, the forest department develops newly emerged chars for a period of 10 to 15 years. The objectives of the forest department activities are to accelerate accretion, stabilise the land, and protect it against storms and cyclones. Historical trends reveal that during the times when the forest department was in control, poor and landless households located and occupied the chars. According to government regulations and the ministry of land oversight, each household is provided 1 to 1.5 acres of char land. However, the geographical setting, scarcity of proper infrastructure and isolation from the mainland impede the functioning of administration, and services such as law enforcement, economic participation, health and education are very limited. Adaptability strategies in these areas are strikingly different from the other parts of the country. The chars are considerably more susceptible to covariate shocks due to cyclones, erosion, water-logging, droughts and salinity intrusion. To improve the livelihoods of char-dwellers, several tailored interventions have been designed and implemented. While the beginning of development activities in these areas date back to the late 1970s, the Char Development and Settlement Program (CDSP) maximised the momentum and set itself up as a leading intervention circa 1994. Facilitated by the government of Bangladesh, Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), it has since expanded into several phases. This programme offers a wide range of support components that target livelihood in the chars among other areas. A recent CDSP study revealed that successful livestock rearing training positively influenced food consumption and increased entrepreneurship as well. In addition, there was an improvement in water and sanitation practices along with an overall increase in human rights awareness. Undoubtedly, the CDSP programme has elevated living standards in the chars that improve at each programme phase although it is unclear whether the programme would be implemented in Bhasan Char. Habitation of Bhasan Char is widely debated, yet key questions surrounding security, economic participation and language are left unanswered. In addition, there is the question of the availability of health and education services. The lack of law enforcement is a concern. Before 1994, char laws stated that the government automatically owned char lands. However, recent amendments suggest that government ownership applies if no private claimant establishes prior ownership rights. In addition, the lack of day-to-day char governance has created scope for manipulation among the char population. Mirroring a feudal system, jotedars--a class of \"rich\" peasants living on the mainland coast regions--have their own puppets called lathyals to control char dwellers. Ironically, the lathyals, using violence and intimidation, promise char dwellers security over other extraneous threats at a cost, collected as a form of rent. Their sinister antics also target government officials. Blurred property rights and the absence of government control create security risks for the Rohingya population. Not to mention, approximately 80 percent of the Rohingya population are women and children. Typically, char dwellers work on economic activities such as livestock rearing, farming sustainable vegetation and fishing. These activities wholly depend on mainland trade. The government will potentially allow the Rohingyas to work on Bhasan Char but they have not revealed the specifics yet. Will the government allow the Rohingya population full access to mainland markets? If yes, how will Rohingyas travel to the mainland? The inter-char transport system is active albeit limited to water-based methods. Beyond economics, water transport is necessary during frequent seasonal threats. Does the government plan on granting Rohingyas the freedom to move in and out of the char? Another source of concern that has not been addressed is the language barrier. The dialect the Rohingyas speak is fairly close to Chittagonian, which is the local dialect of Chattogram and Cox's Bazar. This fluidity in communication promotes stronger integration and opportunities. However, this advantage dissipates should they move to Bhasan Char where the local dialect (Noakhali) is quite different. Char health services have improved thanks to organisations such as BRAC, but are not near mainland capabilities. Some trained medical workers provide on-site medical care such as women's health services. However, char dwellers depend on untrained practitioners. Approximately 60 percent of the Rohingya children population require education, though NGOs can only provide foundational learning. Provisions for higher education are non-existent. How does the government propose to educate the Rohingya youth at Bhasan Char? It should be noted that seasonal extremes affect their school attendance too. Discussion with aid personnel on the ground revealed that many Rohingyas harbour the desire to return home if their citizenship rights are restored. Relocating to Bhasan Char will, in effect, leave them one step removed from this possibility ever occurring. In the medium- to long-term, they believe in integration possibilities and enjoy a sense of familiarity with the Cox's Bazar terrain. Recommendations have been offered to ease host community tensions. For instance, the government and NGOs can do more to address major host community needs; joint programming on projects such as the World Bank's proposal to tackle deforestation serves as a strong community-building opportunity. In fact, recent survey results indicate that 58 percent of Rohingyas, who want to meet with host communities, believe not enough is being done to do so. Likewise, half the locals who want to meet with the Rohingyas agree. Indeed, Bangladesh has generously sheltered the Rohingya population amid the mass exodus. Now tasked with considering medium- to long-term solutions, the international community must step up to assist Bangladesh with fair and adaptable options. Security, economic participation, communication, health and education are key elements involved in achieving solutions. Moreover, listening to stakeholders such as host communities and the Rohingya population should remain a top priority.

After failing to get response from the upazila parishad, locals built a hanging bridge about four months ago but the structure, made without involvement of any engineer or expert, remains a risky one for a large number of users. Usually aluminium wire rope is used to build such a hanging bridge. But 12-mm diameter iron rods have been used there while four tall tree trunks instead of RCC pillars have been used on the two sides of the bridge. The weak bridge tilts slightly to one side. Nurul Islam, headmaster of Tapto Masterpara Government Primary School, said, \"When we get on the bridge, it swings. Many students do not like to come to school as they have to cross the risky bridge. The government approved the construction of a two-story building for this school but its work is not likely to start before building of the bridge.\" \"Farmers requiring to take produces to market are facing problem as it is difficult to carry the items on the temporary hanging bridge,\" said Deno Mohan Tripura, headman (traditional leader) of Daldhali Mouza in Matiranga upazila.  Amrito Kumar Tripura, member of Ward No 3 of Matiranga Union Parishad, said, \"After the concrete bridge broke, we informed the upazila administration, the local lawmaker and others concerned and requested help for rebuilding the bridge. Communication problem also hampers development work in the area, including expansion of electricity lines.\" Kongjari Chowdhury, chairman of Khagrachari Hill District Council, said, \"Rebuilding the bridge has been included in our priority project. We are waiting for allocation of fund for rebuilding the bridge.\""

Dr Kaikaus urged journalists to aware people not to believe any rumour about power disruption across the country. He said there might be some cases of disruption locally in some areas due to flood as power transformers have gone under water but there is no possibility of countrywide power cut. Unique Group signed a contract with the government today to set up a 584MW combined cycle power plant in Meghnaghat in the next three years on build-own-operate basis. As per the deal, the consortium of Unique Hotel and Resorts Ltd, GE Capital Global Energy Investment BV and Strategic Finance Ltd will invest $520 million to set up the plant from which the state-owned Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) will purchase electricity for 22 years. Unique Hotel and Resorts Ltd, a sister concern of Unique Group, holds 64.98 per cent stake in the project while GE Capital Global Energy Investment BV, a subsidiary of GE, USA, holds 30 percent stake while the Strategic Finance holds 4.95 percent. The levelised tariff for the electricity was set at 3.6923 US Cents per kilowatt hour (each unit) if the plant uses natural gas with 84 percent plant factor. The tariff will be 6.8098 US Cents per kWh if the plant uses imported LNG where gas price was set at $7.2625 per mmbtu with plant factor at 84 per cent. Addressing the contract signing ceremony at Biduyt Bhaban in the city today, State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid said the government will gradually replace inefficient power plants with the installation of new base-load large power plants. The contract signing ceremony was also addressed by US Ambassador Earl R Miller, SDG chief coordinator AbulKalam Azad, power secretary Dr Ahmad Kaikaus, energy secretary, National Board of Revenue (NBR) chairman Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan, BPDB chairman Khaled Mahmood and Petrobangla chairman Ruhul Amin."

      "text": "President Abdul Hamid today urged the authorities concerned to encourage people all to keep their houses and surroundings clean for preventing dengue. He said this while delivering congratulatory speech on the occasion of Eid-ul-Azha at Bangabhaban in the morning. President Hamid said Eid is being observed at a time when dengue fever has taken a heavy toll on public health and spread all over the country. He urged everyone to dispose animal waste at designated spots and said unplanned dumping may cause more aedes mosquito infestation. \"The concerned will have to take measures to encourage all to keep their houses and surroundings clean for preventing dengue. You'll also have to pay attention so that the joy of Eid doesn't cause sufferings to others. It's possible to prevent dengue if we're aware of the situation,\" he said, asking people not to panic. In a message, the President said the spirit of sacrifice of Eid-ul-Azha is a unique example of showing respect and love to the Almighty. Prophet Ibrahim has set an incomparable example of love, obedience and sacrifice to Allah by taking steps to sacrifice his beloved son Prophet Ismail at the directive of Allah, he said. \"Azha means Qurbani (sacrifice) or dedicating something. Realising the essence of sacrifice, we'll have to be imbued with the mindset of sacrifice and restrain to pave the way for establishing peace and welfare in society,\" President Hamid said. He said peace and brotherhood will be established in society if the lesson of sacrifice is reflected in our personal and social lives. The President said Qurbani teaches us about sacrifice. \"So, reflect the lesson of sacrifice in your personal, social and national lives without confining Eid to celebrations and work for creating a pollution-free environment,\" he said. Abdul Hamid urged the affluent people to come forward to extend their support to end the misery and sufferings of the flood affected people. \"People from different parts of the flood affected region have been suffering ... they're deprived of the joy of Eid,\" he said. Advisors to the Prime Minister, ministers, the chief justice, army and navy chiefs, diplomats, police chief and other prominent people joined the programme. Secretaries concerned to the President were also present."

      "text": "The ecosystem of the haors and wetlands in the northeast region of Bangladesh--including the districts of Sunamganj, Sylhet, Habiganj, Moulvibazar, Netrokona, Kishoreganj and Brahmanbaria--plays a vital role in ensuring our food and nutrition security and preserving the environmental balance of the country. There are a total 373 haor wetlands there that cover approximately 43 percent of the total area of the seven haor districts. The region is well known for its beauty and natural resources. However, it is mostly populated by poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of people living in flood-prone areas, and lacking access to basic services including education, employment opportunities and decent living standards. Road connectivity along with the transportation system is a serious concern here. In Sunamganj, for instance, there is no road connection between the Upazilas.  From the 60's until 2008, development initiatives taken in this region followed a model of \"trade-off\" between development for its human inhabitants and its environmental integrity. Even then, there were hardly any visible positive outcomes in the absence of well-integrated and cohesive development work. Since the 90's, however, environmental concerns in development initiatives in this area, as elsewhere in the country and even outside, became more prominent and drew theoretical intervention. As a result, Tanguar Haor, located in the Dharmapasha and Tahirpur upazilas of Sunamganj, was declared as an ecologically critical area in 1999, and as a Ramsar site--\"a wetland site designated to be of international importance under the Ramsar Convention\"--in 2000. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) got the authority to protect the Tanguar haor in 2006.  The idea of a comprehensive development framework for this haor region emerged in 2009. A 2012 study by a not-for-profit public trust under the Ministry of Water Resources, the Center for Environment and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS), for formerly Bangladesh Haor and Wetland Development Board (currently Directorate of Bangladesh Haor and Wetland Development), presented a 20-year master plan for the area. Since then, development interventions and outputs continue to be seemingly visible. Furthermore, a 2017 study by CEGIS documents an impact assessment of structural interventions in hoar ecosystem and innovations for solution. The 2017 CEGIS study acknowledges that any wetland ecosystem is fragile and vulnerable, and haor-wetland is one of the major ecosystems of the country that necessitates a holistic eco-friendly plan for any development action to keep a harmonious relationship between humans and nature, which is also essential for the sustainability of the haor wetlands. Also, the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2016-30 called for a departure from the \"trade-off\" police in development economics and instead sought \"eco-friendly\" solutions. The 20-year framework plan is being implemented on a short-, medium- and long-term basis, integrating the multifaceted development interventions including flood management, environmental sustainability, crop production, fisheries and livestock, expansion of education, settlement and health facilities, road communication, navigation, water supply and sanitation, industry, afforestation, and generation of power and energy. The planned investment portfolio includes 17 sectors: water resources, agriculture, fisheries, pearl culture, livestock, forest, education, health, transportation, housing and settlement, water supply and sanitation, industry, energy and power, mineral resources, biodiversity and wetland, tourism and social services.  An eco-friendly integrated development approach, which would recognise the importance of optimising available resources of the haor region as well as a sustainable development of the potential of the area by incorporating all relevant social, cultural and environmental aspects, is a must here. Being a member of the community in this region, I am thankful to the government for its timely policy initiatives, but the haor people would not like to see a repeat of fragile development interventions of the past or the shadow of any corruption. There should be a zero-tolerance policy against \"paper-based\" development--meaning, development works that exist only in papers, with no real-life outcomes. A traditional approach cannot encounter the problem at hand nor can it address the need for the kind of development that is needed. This requires a multifaceted development operational modality with diverse and innovative engagements and wide-ranging partnerships including government-entrepreneurial collaboration, public-private partnership, public-private-research institute partnership, GO-NGO partnership, government-university partnership, and government-media partnership. Thus, the government must encourage more innovative and proactive proposals from the parties involved--public, private, entrepreneurial, media, non-government, university, research and advocacy institutes.  Furthermore, an expert commission needs to be built along with a set of quality, performance as well as achievement indicators and timeframe-based measurement tools. Also, more focused research and evidence-based advocacy, as well as innovations and innovative proposals need to be developed. Recently, I had a discussion with XDsocial, a knowledge-based entrepreneurial and management company, to develop a public-private-research institute/university partnership proposal focusing on social contributions in large-scale local employment opportunity generation, food and nutrition value addition, and innovative reprocessed energy creation for the community. More such initiatives are needed. Such people-centric as well as eco-friendly creative thinking and proposals need to be continually appreciated and supported by the government. Certainly, the people are the ends and means of any development initiative, and eco-friendly solutions are needed for sustainable development. We do not want mindless development in the haor region. The development must be eco-friendly so that it will have no adverse effect on the future generation and indeed the vital ecosystem of this region.

      "text": "The flood affected victims of Lalmonirhat have very little to look forward to this Eid. Many have lost their homes and source of income and are struggling to make ends meet. The flood victims of 108 villages of 27 unions in five upazilas of the districts are unable to even buy food let alone new dresses or sacrificial cattle. Most of these people have lost their homes, croplands and domestic animals in the recent floods and are yet to get back to normalcy.  Several flood victims said they are waiting for help from government and non-government organisations to buy food and other things to celebrate Eid with their family. \"I'm not able to purchase any new clothes for our three children this Eid. I cannot even buy good food and other essentials for the festival,\" said Abdul Quader, 48, a flood victim living in Kalmati village in Teesta River basin area of Lalmonirhat Sadar upazila. Flood hit Kulsum Bewa, 62, from the same upazila said her family had to evacuate their house and go take shelter on the elevated road for nearly 16 days just last month. Meanwhile flood victim Idris Ali, 45 of Gaddimari village in Hatibandha upazila was rendered jobless from July 9 to 30 and only got back to work on July 31. Chairman of Teesta River basin flood affected Rajpur union parishad in Lalmonirhat Sadar upazila, Mofazzal Hossain Mofa told the Daily Star many of the people in this area will have no reason to celebrate Eid following the devastation of the floods. The government has allocated 73,843 VGF (vulnerable group feeding) cards among ultra-poor families in 45 unions and two municipalities under five upazilas of the district ahead of Eid-ul-Azha and each card holder will be given 15 kg of rice, said District Relief and Rehabilitation Office (DRRO) Ali Haider. However, no special allocation has been allocated to help the flood-hit people in char areas to celebrate the festival, he added."

      "text": "With flood situation worsening in different parts of the country, strong current in rivers including the Jamuna and Arial Kha eroding houses and properties of hundreds of people in Tangail and Faridpur. In Bhuapur upazila of Tangail, the situation has taken a serious turn as the Jamuna has been eroding hundreds of dwellings and vast tracts of croplands along its banks, reports our correspondent in Tangail. Inhabitants in the area have been living in anxiety of losing their houses and properties to the river's erosion in the last one month. The worst affected villages are Khanurbari, Kostapara and Bhalkutia under Govindasi union where over 300 dwellings and a large swathe of croplands have disappeared in the Jamuna over the last three weeks. A large number of the affected people from the villages have taken shelter on different roads and houses of others. Last week, Firoza Bewa, a widow with four children, lost her house on eight decimals of land in Kostapara village to the erosion. Since then, they have been living in a makeshift structure by the river. \"My husband, a rickshaw-van puller, died in cardiac arrest few months ago. Now where will I go with my children? Who will give us shelter?\" wondered Firoza. Many others like her are now living in the open after losing everything including their crops and belongings to the river. Jhoton Chanda, upazila nirbahi officer in Bhuapur, said, \"We are preparing a list of the erosion victims in order to provide them with necessary assistance.\" Meanwhile, Water Development Board (WDB) workers were seen dumping geotextile bags along a 75-meter-long stretch at Khanurbari village. Obhijit Ghosh, a resident of Kostapara village, said finding the steps taken by the WDB inadequate for checking the erosion, villagers in many areas were seen dumping bags filled with dirt.   Contacted, Sirajul Islam, executive engineer of WDB in Tangail, said water in the Jamuna was flowing 15 centimetres above danger level at Bhuapur point yesterday. \"Since it's tough to get a big project passed, we are taking smaller projects in phases to check the erosion. Preparations are ongoing to dump geo bags along another 75 meters of the affected area,\" he added. In Faridpur, at least 11 houses and 2,000 bighas of croplands were lost to erosion of the Arial Kha river in five villages of Sadarpur upazila in the last three days, reports our correspondent in the district. The affected villages are Amir Khanar Kandi, Zajira Kandi, Charbondorkhola, Kazi Kandi and Adel Uddin Mollah Kandi village in Char Manair union. Ayub Ali, chairman of Char Manair Union Parishad, said the erosion of the river started last Friday and so far, at least 11 houses and 2,000 bighas of croplands were devoured. Although the WDB in Faridpur has been dumping geo bags to check the erosion, strong current of the river is washing those away. Even the building of Char Manair Union Parishad and Char Bandarkhola Madrasa are now under erosion threat, he added. Kulsum Bibi, an elderly resident of Zajira Kandi village, said, \"The rampage of the Arial Kha has distressed us enormously. The river has devoured our ancestral homestead.\" After losing 10 bighas of land to the erosion, Kamal Hawladar, another resident of the same village, said he and his family were bracing for further sufferings in future. Kazi Kandi village resident Abdul Karim Hawladar said in only two days' time, the river devoured 20 bighas of his land. Sadarpur Upazila Nirbahi Officer Purobi Goldar said the higher authorities were made aware of the situation. She also said, \"WDB has been dumping geo bags in the affected areas and we engaged an officer from our upazila administration [to oversee the work].\" WDB Executive Engineer in Faridpur Sultan Mahmud said as a temporary measure to contain the erosion as well as ease sufferings of people, they have been dumping geo bags in affected areas."

      "text": "If you go to Motijheel and look for the proverbial \"jheel\" the financial hub of the capital is named after, you will be disappointed.  But after putting in some effort and asking around, you will find a waterbody behind Bangladesh Water Development Board where ferrying service is still in operation. The waterbody (at present resembling a pond) stretches over an area of about one acre, and has two boat services -- benefitting hundreds of people who take the route. This \"pond\" is the last remaining vestige of the fabled jheel in the area which supposedly linked Buriganga and Shitalakhya rivers to Sengunbagicha, Arambagh and Gopibagh canals, said locals. Many used to commute to Motijheel using boats, they claimed. Gopibagh canal was turned into a road in the 1990s and most parts of the jheel were filled up around that time, says Jahangir Alam, a resident of Gopibagh. Buildings and roads were constructed on it (parts of the jheel), said a former Wasa official. As tragic as the death of the many waterbodies in the city is, many still use the pond that remains as a shortcut and save 10-15 minutes to go to Motijheel from Kamalapur, Gopibagh, Tikatuli and other adjoining areas. Fare is Tk 2 during peak hours, and Tk 5 after 9pm and in weekends. Enamul Haque, an official of Bangladesh Water Development Board, who was in a hurry to cross the pond on a Monday morning, said that in the morning even five minutes are crucial to office-goers. Logically, a huge number of them use the boat services to get to work within a short time. The route is so popular among office-goers that queues form at both ends of the waterbody during peak hours every workday, he said. Ripon Ali, a first-year student of Kamalapur Sher-e-Bangla Railway School and College, said every day he goes to school on foot and takes this shortcut on a boat. \"It takes only a couple of minutes to cross the waterbody. I can reach my school in 10-15 minutes,\" said Ripon, a resident of Tikatuli. \"It would cost Tk 30-40 if I take a rickshaw to school,\" said Ripon. Kholilur Rahman, a resident of Gopibagh, said there was a huge waterbody named \"Matimia'r Jheel\" in the area and several thousand boats would come to the gudaraghat (where people embark and disembark) every day from different areas like Demra, Nandipara, Isapur, Trimohoni and Razarbagh. The jheel was linked to rivers at that time, he said. \"We had taken relief materials on boats from here to Demra, Madartek and Bashabo during the 1998 flood,\" he added. Encroachers started filling up the waterbody in the 1990s, which sped up in the early 2000s, said locals. At present, some individuals are claiming ownership of the pond -- putting up signs -- though it is government khas land, they alleged. Heju Miah, a boatman at the ghat, said there are two boats on the small waterbody. Ferrying service starts very early in the morning and continues till 11pm. Ekhlamul Islam, a resident of Gopibagh, said though it is still a vital waterbody in the area, it remains neglected by the authorities concerned. The water of the pond looks polluted and a big part of it has been occupied, he said. Authorities should take immediate measures to beautify this area -- as done with Hatijheel -- as it is the last remaining waterbody in the heart of Motijheel, he urged.

      "text": " The underprivileged people of Borangile village in Sirajganj's Chauhali upazila can sleep a little better at night, knowing that if they are ever unable to find work as day labourers the next day, they can easily borrow some rice from the community food bank. Such little comfort is all thanks to the smart thinking of Kohinoor Begum, who along with some 40 other villagers, set up the food bank for times of need. The initiative is now a source of inspiration for neighbouring villages. Situated around a hundred kilometres from Sirajganj town, the people of Borangile often fall out of the purview of receiving government amenities or relief, even though they are among those critically affected by flood. The village lies on char lands of the Jamuna basin, where people are mostly dependent on finding work as day labourers to survive. They are able to grow some crops when the water in the river recedes and the char lands are exposed. Kohinoor, a housewife, and the others set up the food bank last year to meet food demands during times like off-crop periods. She is chairman of the reserve. When this correspondent visited the village on August 9, he attended one of the meetings of the reserve at the chairman's house along with the other members. \"Early in 2018, a few women of our underprivileged community and I walked back barefoot for a couple of hours after we went to collect relief materials from the local government. However, we were let down as relatives of the local member-chairman got the relief items instead of us,\" said Kohinoor, reminiscing the time when the reserve came into being. \"I then called a meeting at home to take matters in my hand and shared my decision to form a food bank.\" The community is poor and destitute, but there are some who are needier than the others, she added. \"We should do something for them. During hard times, any member can take rice from our bank.\" On avoiding total dependence on government support, she said, \"We are also trying to gather financial support from other villagers as donations.\" Members of this food bank started setting aside whatever little they could manage in 2018. They now have 45 members and their savings crossed Tk 30,000. \"A few days ago, our family fell into a crisis. I borrowed eight kilograms of rice from the food bank and overcame the crisis,\" said Aduri Khatun, also a member of the bank. The bank does not charge any interest for such services, said Shumi Khatun, 28, one of the beneficiaries of the bank. Another villager, Rajib Siddique, 27, who recently completed his graduation, said, \"Kohinoor Khala [aunt] is an inspiration for all of us. Her lone initiative has saved us from extreme hunger.\" \"The food bank is a laudable example. They can now solve some of their problems from their own resources,\" said Romjan Ali, chairman of Ghorjan union of the district. \"At least 3,000 families were gravely flood affected in our union and the government budget hardly covered all the victims. In this situation, this type of a food bank is really beneficial,\" he added.  "

The artist received the Ekushey Padak this year, for his outstanding contribution to fine arts. He is also famous for his artwork series on pigeons, horses, boats, gypsies, flood victims, fishermen, marine life and the mystic troubadours of Bangladesh. Ahmed's artworks have earned him many other accolades at home and abroad.   He uses soft pastel along with thin acrylic dust layers and charcoal as the background of his paintings. The acrylic and charcoal dust generate amazing textures, along with a mystique aura on the surface of the canvas. He often makes impromptu paintings with female models. \"A true artist always experiments with new techniques. Abstract art is easier to do while realistic art is hard to portray,\" says Ahmed. \"I do two types of paintings. Some of my works are meant to communicate with the general audience, while others are designed to satisfy the artist in me. At the end of day, an artist never truly retires. He lives on through his work.\" For Ahmed, painting is similar to composing music. \"People often become emotional while listening to melodious songs. However, singers who sing only with their voices and not with their hearts, fail to leave lasting impressions. The same is true for art,\" he says. \"Great artists always put their heart and soul into their creations.\" Referring to renowned artists Turner and Monet, he said that the forthcoming generation of artists should regularly go for outdoor projects. He also suggested the re-launching of compulsory art education in schools.   Ahmed was a visiting teacher and artist in residence in the Art and Design Department at the North Carolina State University in 1995. He is currently a Professor at the Department of Drawing and Painting of the Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka. He is also the current President of Bangladesh Charushilpi Sangsad.  "

A large number of farmers cannot prepare their fields for Aman cultivation due to deposition of sand and garbage during the floods. Those who are trying to start farming have to count additional cost for removing the garbage, said local farmers. Nur-un-Nabi Sarker, project implementation officer of Sundarganj, said the recent floods caused an estimated loss of Tk 41 crore 47 lakh 13 thousand 550 in the upazila. It includes Tk 33 crore 59 lakh 78 thousand 550 in rural infrastructures like roads, bridges, culverts and cluster villages, Tk 4 crore 83 lakh in agriculture, Tk 1.80 crore in roads, bridges and culverts under Local Government Engineering Department, Tk 50 lakh of secondary education department, Tk 18 lakh of primary education department, Tk 43 lakh of fisheries department, and Tk 13.35 lakh of livestock department. \"I took shelter on the embankment after the flood washed away my two huts used for dwelling. The water has receded but I am still staying here as I can't rebuild my home due to hardship,\" said Afsar Ali, a farm labourer in Belka of Sundarganj. \"My three bighas of land got covered with a thick layer of sand as surging water inundated the area after breaches in the embankment. Normally it would take at least two years for the land to regain fertility,\" said Solaiman, a small farmer of Belka. Many of the croplands in char areas are still under knee-deep water and so, Aman farming there still remains uncertain, said Faridul of the same area. Farmer Rafiqul Islam of Kapasia union said they are worried about the next Aman cultivation as the three-week-long floods damaged seedbeds in large areas. Road communications are still in disarray as floods damaged roads, culverts and bridges at different places. \"Without special allocation from the government, it would be difficult to renovate damaged roads and culverts in the area. Besides, many of the flood-affected people need financial help for rebuilding their damaged houses and removing sand from croplands,\" said Nafiul Islam Jimy, chairman of Haripur union parishad. Md Solaiman Ali, upazila nirbahi officer of Sundarganj, said a list with estimated damage in flood affected areas have been sent to respective ministries, urging for immediate allocation to start rehabilitation work as early as possible."

Boat is very essential transport for them in the upcoming rainy season, but many of them cannot afford boats due to its high prices. Meanwhile, boat craftsmen are also not happy as they are not getting expected orders this year, said locals. It is charged Tk 1.20 lakh for making a 50-feet length boat, Tk 1 lakh for a 40-feet length boat and Tk 80,000 for a 30-feet length boat according to sizes but it was charged Tk 30,000 to Tk 70,000 last year and more less in 2017, said boat craftsmen and fishermen. Meher Ali, 48, of Teesta River Char Bairati in Kaliganj upazila, said around 30 to 40 char people jointly buy a big size boat for carrying people and goods during flood. Besides, a number of affluent men buy new boats during the time but they are showing less interest in this regard this time due to higher prices. So, old boats are now being repaired, said Meher.  Shafiqul Islam, project manager of a local NGO working for char people's livelihood, said there are 95 char areas in the Teesta and Dharla rivers. There are 42 ghats and two or four boats are anchored at each ghat. Around 5,000 fishermen are dependent on the rivers. Four to six fishermen use a big size boat for netting fish in the rivers, said Shafiqul, adding that there are two or three big boats for the villagers in each char area. Many char people have also middle size boat for personal uses. Craftsman Nazrul Islam, 44, of Teesta river Char Gaddimari in Hatibandha upazila, said the charge of boat making jumped as the price of wood shot up at a rapid speed this year. Another craftsman Abdus Samad, 55, of the area, said boat making order has fallen drastically this year. He got order for making three boats only this year while it was six last year and eight in 2017, Samad said, adding that they all 60 boat craftsmen in Teesta and Dharla char areas are facing same situation.

In response, I told that I would go there when the Rohingyas will go back to Myanmar,\" the foreign minister said. \"I also invited Myanmar to visit Bangladesh to talk to their Rohingya people and to understand their expectations,\" Momen said. Globally it has been established that there was a massive crime committed against the Rohingyas, that was described by the UN as a classic case of ethnic cleansing while French President Macron termed it as genocide, he said. India not pushing anyone into Bangladesh Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen also said India is not pushing anybody into Bangladesh but some people are coming with the help of middlemen with an impression that one can have free food here, UNB adds. He said the government will send them back if anybody other than Bangladesh citizens enters the country through the Bangladesh-India border without following the due process. The Foreign Minister said Bangladesh requested India to give the list if there is any Bangladeshi living in India illegally. \"Let's know it (Bangladesh seeks info from India),\" he told reporters at the Foreign Affairs Ministry adding that there is a standard procedure to follow in that case. Dr Momen highlighted Bangladesh's socio-economic development while joblessness in India in some cases. He said those who are Bangladesh citizens have the right to come back to Bangladesh but others will be sent back. Responding to a question on National Register of Citizenship (NRC), he said India termed it their internal matter and assured Bangladesh that it will in no way affect Bangladesh. \"The Bangladesh-India relations are normal. The relations won't be affected...the relations are very sweet,\" said the Foreign Minister explaining reasons behind the cancellation of his New Delhi visit. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs here said the scheduled visit of Dr Momen was cancelled due to his 'busy schedule' at home ahead of Martyred Intellectuals Day and Victory Day, said a senior official on Thursday. India also termed its relations with Bangladesh \"very strong\" and brushed aside speculations over the last-minute cancellation of Dr Momen's New Delhi visit. \"We've been informed by Bangladesh side that the change in the programme was due to domestic issues related to commemoration of Bangladesh Victory Day on December 16,\" official spokesperson at the Indian Ministry of External Affairs Raveesh Kumar told reporters at a briefing in New Delhi on Thursday. He termed speculations linking the cancellation of the visit to the Indian Parliament's adoption of the Citizenship Amendment Bill \"unwarranted.\" The MEA spokesperson ruled out the speculation, saying: \"There have been unwarranted speculations...\""

If the ministry of land leased the area for the proposed construction, it would require land filling and the decimation of some 5,000 trees. While there is a need for the police administration to build the necessary infrastructure to train police personnel, developing this particular spot for an academy complex would threaten the forest cover and disturb the ecological balance that the forest provides. On top of that, the land in question is flood-prone and would require significant expenditure in land filling and dredging to protect it from future inundation. It is understood that the prison authorities have already marked some 800 trees for felling to make way for the construction of the complex, and people of the locality fear that it will mean irrecoverable damage to the forest with its ancient trees. A visit to the area has found that the authorities have set up several signboards on the flood control embankment of the area, declaring the proposed site of the academy.  Precious forest areas need to be conserved, not decimated. Forest land should not be leased to any party, even if it is for public construction, because it sets the precedence for private entities to follow suit. We hope that an alternative site would be found for the academy that does not disturb the environment or the ecological balance of the area."

In some instances, those who shoulder the burden do so voluntarily; some are compensated for their sacrifice and, in most cases, the suffering is imposed without their knowledge and consent. Add to that the tons of catastrophic events such as industrial accidents, mine collapses, and transport disasters that are a regular news item in this day and age. Ironically, many of these were foreseen and the deaths and illnesses could have been prevented. Victims of industrial accidents are sometimes paid compensation although these are often small quantities of money and frequently do not reach the victims on time. Fortunately, we now have the capability to identify the culprits and are constantly refining the mechanism to measure the cost of the pain, suffering and physical damage they generate. A review of these disasters has identified three problems: 1) Safety inspectors are lax or go easy on owners; 2) Companies hire inspectors from \"friendly\" agencies; and 3) Companies ignore inspection reports or disregard early warning signs.  To start off this dialogue and to provide a context for the theme of this write-up, I will mention two recent instances of criminal neglect that has caused death and suffering for workers. Amnesty International recently reported that children as young as seven are working in very dangerous conditions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to mine cobalt, a metal used in smartphones, cars and computers sold by Apple, Microsoft and Vodafone. In Hungary, a few years ago, an industrial accident at an alumina plant killed eight people and injured more than 220. Finally, on February 4, two former senior executives were convicted and sentenced to prison in one of the few instances where the wheels of justice turned, however slowly. The latest disaster, which has led to a global outcry for action to prevent human rights abuse, happened in South America. An estimated 300 people were killed after a dam collapsed on January 25, at an iron ore mine owned by Vale SA. Vale is the world's biggest producer of nickel and iron ore, a raw ingredient for steel. A holding dam at the Corrego do Feijao mine, located near the city of Brumadinho in the state of Minas Gerais in south-eastern Brazil, gave way releasing a tide of mud, toxic sludge, and mining debris that swept away an entire village. The sludge buried a company cafeteria brimming with workers during a lunch break, and other Vale buildings, and inundated a part of Brumadinho. This is not the first time that Vale has been cited for its failure to ensure safety standards and abide by \"conflict of interest\" regulations designed to keep the fox away from the chicken coops. In 2015, a similar incident at Bento Rodrigues dam at the Brazilian mining company Vale's Samarco joint venture in Mariana town killed 19 people when the iron ore tailings dam gave way, and flooded two villages, destroying around 200 homes. Experts are blaming the Brumadinho disaster on criminal negligence on the part of the employees of Vale and contractors hired by the mine to inspect its dams. The government arrested five individuals, three of whom are senior members of the mining company and two inspectors from TUV SUD, a German company that Vale SA hired to certify the safety of the Corrego do Feijao dam. Officials indicated that while the criminal case against the owners and management of Vale is only beginning, the arrests are a precautionary move to prevent the individuals from leaving the country. Two of the five arrested are inspectors from TUV SUD, who had certified the dam as structurally sound. Makoto Namba, one of the arrested inspectors, had stated that the dam had a low probability of failure. Critics, however, observe that this is a familiar story in the business. The Vale mining company told the Associated Press that there are eight sirens in the area around its dam that failed. They also held that \"the speed in which the event happened made sounding an alarm impossible.\"  New documents show that TUV SUD also acted as consultants on Vale mine closures in Brazil. The Wall Street Journal ran a story on February 4 under the headline \"Inspectors of Collapsed Brazilian Dam Had Close Ties to Its Owner\", and again raised a critical alarm applicable for all. This incident \"raises fresh questions over whether the dual role of safety evaluator and consultant presents a conflict of interest that can compromise safety,\" the report said. Commenting on this cosy arrangement between Vale and TUV SUD, Dr Gavin Mudd, an environmental engineering professor at Australia's RMIT University, observed that \"the expertise is too connected with those controlling the money--and nowhere near enough emphasis on protecting the public interest.\" A review of guidelines for external audits for mining companies in Canada suggests that external audits should be conducted by entities whose \"independence can be demonstrated by the freedom from the activity being audited or freedom from bias and conflict of interest.\" The UN Human Rights immediately issued a statement asking for the Brazilian government to launch a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation. \"The tragedy demands accountability and calls into question preventive measures taken subsequent to the Samarco mining disaster in Minas Gerais just over three years ago, when a catastrophic flood of mining waste near Mariana killed 19 people and affected the lives of millions, including indigenous communities.\" In all these accidents, there is evidence that corrective measures could have prevented the loss of life, property, and human suffering. For example, a leaked report from 2013, two years before the Mariana dam collapse, had identified structural issues in the dam. Prosecutors allege that the company took no action, and many of the victims are still waiting for justice. There is a renewed question as to whether Vale did enough to improve its safety protocols following the Mariana accident. \"They prioritized profits and left safety in second place,\" said Jose Adercio Sampaio, coordinator of a task force of federal prosecutors, summarising the criminal case against the joint venture and its parent companies Government officials have been called out too this time. Federal officials have pledged to make mining regulations stricter, Catherine Osborn, a print and radio journalist based in Rio de Janeiro reported. \"But for many, this disaster has laid bare the difference between pledges and enforcement.\" Vale was suspended from the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRP) over the dam disaster. CHRP is a global compact aimed at preventing adverse impacts on workers, communities and consumers. Nonetheless, Vale is among the mining companies still receiving investments from several large European banks, despite the recurrent violations of environmental and human rights, as investigated in a Dirty Profits 6 report.

      "text": "A dam in Kakunkhai area of Sylhet's Gowainghat has killed the Baulikhal river at its source, depriving many villages of a freshwater source for about one-and-a-half-year. Water flow to the Baulikhal, which is a branch of the Sari river, has been completely stopped at the confluence by the 400-feet long dam that now serves as a road, locals said. The Baulikhal, also known as the Hidairkhal, merged with the Kapna river 13-km downstream. The Baulikhal was a water source for 18 smaller rivers and canals and 37 haors and beels. People of about 39 villages in Gowainhat depend on these waterbodies, officials and environmentalists said. Alirgaon Union Parishad constructed the dam early last year, they added. Residents of Khola, Budhigaon and Titkulli villages raised Tk 35 lakh for it as they needed better communication across the Baulikhal, said Golam Kibria Helal, general secretary of Gowainghat Awami League, who was chairman of the union parishad at the time. The rest of the money was funded by the union parishad, upazila chairman and local lawmaker. Abdul Karim Kim, general secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon's Sylhet Chapter, said laws and regulations regarding dam construction were not followed while constructing the dam. He added that nearly 50,000 people in the upazila are being deprived of a freshwater source due to the dam. Zahirul Islam, section officer of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) in Sylhet, said, \"The board knew nothing about the construction of the dam. If we were informed, we could have stopped the construction and suggested a suitable and appropriate alternative.\" Former UP chairman Golam Kibria Helal said, \"I supported the dam construction considering the communication problem. \"We knew about the laws regarding rivers but how could we call this a river? Water flowed only during monsoon and it stayed dry during the rest of the year. We believe that we did the right thing.\" Meanwhile, the primary findings of a study, conducted last year in Gowainghat by the Institute of Water and Flood Management (IWFM) of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, showed the negative impact of the dam on the local ecosystem, BWDB officials said. The study, titled \"Feasibility Study for Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation System at Gowainghat in Sylhet District\", recommended removal of the dam. BWDB Executive Engineer Sahiduzzaman Sarkar said, \"The IWFM is yet to provide the final report of the study. We will remove the dam after getting the report. We may propose construction of a structure that will allow the river to flow as well as maintain road communication.\" On September 3, environmentalists held a rally on the bank of the Rangpani river in Jaintiapur upazila, urging the government to take prompt steps to remove the dam."

      "text": "The internet has had a complete ball of a year, thanks to millennials turning older and 'CRAY-zier' and fighting the growing costs of living. If you think that this 'I cannot buy a home because I spent all my money on avocadoes and that is why I am sad' is a problem just in the west, just drag your mouse and zoom in on Dhaka on the map (especially on the tri-state area). While in the west millennials are struggling with how to finance their avocadoes, millennials in the east (yes, the privileged middle-class ones) are worried about how to appease their moms after breaking their 11:00pm curfew.  And then there was this past one year in Bangladesh, especially Dhaka, which was rocked by protest after protest. Some demanding better jobs, some for safer roads, and some completely losing their wits over Raba Khan as a panelist at the Dhaka Lit Fest. There was too much happening too fast and it felt as though the whole country was hopped up on steroids. And yours truly, was no different, what with constantly shielding numerous triggers and also succumbing to it time to time. Through all this, I also found very personal, often minute problems around me take centre stage; and while we all write for a particular audience or a cause whenever we pen a piece, I feel this article is a little bit of everything. By everything, I mean, it is a piece of writing for me, it is for those kindred spirits around me who have been overwhelmed by everything around them and it is my first, real attempt at writing about a life with anxiety and mental-health problems through the last and final years of 2010s and my own 20s. It took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that this is a very real, sometimes debilitating health condition, and it was this very year that I finally acknowledged the need for help. Be it through therapy, through reading, through cooking or through long, sometimes hyperactive, conversations with friends going through the same. And in all of this, constantly questioning everything, my job, my education, my choices, is this shirt too loose? After all, Sigmund Freud proclaimed in his classic introductory lectures on psychoanalysis, \"There is no question that the problem of anxiety is a nodal point at which the most various and important questions converge, a riddle whose solution would be bound to throw a flood of light on our whole mental existence.\" Like I said, this past year has had its fair share of triggers: the violent turn of the quota-reform movement, mass arrests of student leaders, another violent turn of the movement for safer roads, the passing of the Digital Security Act, the definitive knowledge that the areas near Sundarbans will become an industrial zone and all the concerns that come with living in Dhaka. And that some form of anxiety stopped me from even vocalising these concerns on a social media platform was something I realised much later. It is exactly the splitting image of what Montreal-based designer and illustrator Catherine Lepage drew in her Thin Slices of Anxiety: Observations and Advice to Ease a Worried Mind. In the image, there are two faces, one of a \"normal person\" and the other of an anxious person and much like Freud's take on anxiety, the field of vision for an anxious person is essentially gazing inward; it is a convergent world view. Despite this newfound knowledge (that everything just converges inside my head) of anxiety and (ir)regular visits to the therapist, I still felt something was amiss. Thus, began a journey of reading, finding out and turning that gaze more and more inward to understand what is it that has us millennials (the very numbered few in Bangladesh with access to internet and the vast world of memes and a grasp of the language English) in such a frenzy. Despite the nonchalant use of the term these days, the notion of anxiety as a clinical category only appeared as recently as thirty years ago, according to a mental health memoir--My Age of Anxiety: Fear, Hope, Dread, and the Search for Peace of Mind--by Scott Stossel, familiar to most as the editor of The Atlantic. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, some forty million Americans, nearly one in seven, are suffering from some kind of anxiety disorder at any given time, accounting for 31 percent of expenditures on mental health care in the United States. This is not a purely American phenomenon though, as studies have revealed this is a problem in Britain and Canada too. And without resorting to any study, I can say that I have successfully managed to only make friends or associate with people who, a. either suffer from a mental health problem or, b. have a family member with said problem and have an acute understanding of it. Whether this helps us connect, I do not know. But these friends, for me, managed to bring to life the classic Beatles song \"I get by with a little help from my friends\". And this network of people constantly battling the everyday kept me afloat with a supply of books to read, articles to bookmark and recipes to try out, all just in an attempt to fight the inner demons that sometimes threaten to overthrow us all. One Friday, with one friend I would conduct a long-distance cook off, making as many egg dishes as we could, exchanging photos of our breakfast bonanza and then launching a day-long discussion on why social media is pure evil and everyone just showcases a life living in hyperboles. It was also while trying to navigate anxiety I chanced upon old hobbies, things my grandparents always advised would ease a troubled mind. I took up painting (essentially stroking paintbrushes on a blank canvas, soothing nonetheless), I started going to the gym and oh, of course, I continued with the therapy. These home \"remedies\" of ours also found validation through an article published on The Guardian by Gaby Hinsliff which says \"Run, swim, cook: the new prescription for happiness\". While, cooking, swimming, reading or running are by no means meant to cure/solve mental health problems, they have in many ways helped me cope and tackle the everyday. These activities were of course supplemented with professional help. I also reread some old favorites--Heidi and The Magic Faraway Tree--and I read some new ones, ones that were written either by anxious people themselves or with a storyline that I identified with. My personal favorite was First, We Make the Beast Beautiful by Sarah Wilson. Anxiety is layered and is complex. No one better than Stossel can put it though: \"The truth is that anxiety is at once a function of biology and philosophy, body and mind, instinct and reason, personality and culture. Even as anxiety is experienced at a spiritual and psychological level, it is scientifically measurable at the molecular level and the physiological level.\" On a parting note, I want to say one last thing. I am no philosopher but I do believe philosophies are born either out of luxuries or trying times. While navigating the upset and worry of Bangladesh's politics (I categorise this as a trying time) and the debate on \"WHY IS RABA KHAN on a DLF panel\" (this I categorise as a luxury by all means) did not give birth to a thinker in me, it surely got me musing on a life full of fleeting thoughts and fighting anxiety."

      "text": "The Rajshahi prison authorities have moved to grab at least 100 acres of char land in the Padma river in the city's Sreerampur to build Prisons Training Academy complex. They have already been occupying four acres of the Padma char for the last three years claiming ownership though the law allows none but the government to own any piece of land gained by a river.  A number of prison officials have claimed that a proposal was sent to the land ministry in May last year for taking out a \"permanent lease\" on the 100-acre char land and the process to get the ministry's approval was at the final stage. Deputy Inspector General of Prisons in Rajshahi Altab Hossain said they proposed to the land ministry for the lease. He, however, declined to go into details of the process. Contacted, Sebastin Rema, deputy secretary of the land ministry, on Sunday said the ministry was yet to receive any such proposal. But this correspondent saw some official documents that suggest the prison authorities sought the land from the ministry more than once showing it as a \"newly emerged char\". Locals say the land remains submerged during the rainy season. \"The site was selected as no other suitable place was found,\" the DIG prisons told this correspondent at his office on May 2.   He said they wanted to build the academy by the river, and its playground and combat training ground on the 100-acre river land. Any construction on the river land would require some activities like river training and river filling to stop the inundation of the areas below the city protection and flood control embankment, added the official. Citing Bangladesh Land Management Manual 1990, Rajshahi ADC (revenue) Alamgir Kabir said any river char -- even if it emerges afresh -- would be absolutely owned by the government. The prison authorities have some 2.08 acres of char recorded in their name in the Revisional Survey but the government would be the owner of the land as per the law, he said. Rajshahi Deputy Commissioner SM Abdul Kader says the government has the authority to lease out the land, but he has no idea about any process of land acquisition by the prison authorities. He said it was learnt that the jail authorities were claiming some land in the river but he didn't know how much has been occupied. \"In Rajshahi, we noticed some private ownership claims over river land. In other parts of the country, river land is owned solely by the government.\" Last month, the prison authorities started felling trees of a forest in the area for construction of the academy complex. After cutting down 66 trees, they backed off amid protest from locals. The forest is known to have some 100-year-old trees.  The prison officials say there are about 5,000 trees on the Rajshahi Central Jail's property where construction of the academy's infrastructure was underway. They marked some 800 trees for felling to make room for the infrastructure. The DIG prisons says they would consider keeping the old trees untouched while constructing the academy buildings. The country had no other training facility for prison officials and guards before 1995 when the Prisons Training Academy was established in Rajshahi. After a hectic lobbying, it got the government approval in August 2014. Since its inception, the academy has been functioning with accommodation support from the Rajshahi Central Jail. On the jail's property, the academy's commandant has an office in a three-room one-storey building while there are three corrugated iron sheet buildings for trainees to stay and another for holding classes. The academy offers physical, theoretical, and combat trainings for the prison officials and guards. So far, it held basic training courses for six batches of jail superintendents, 10 batches of deputy jailors, and 42 batches of male and female prison guards. Due to lack of infrastructure, the academy sometimes holds training courses at other facilities. For example, it conducted a basic training course for prison guards at Kashimpur Jail in Gazipur in 2016.   In June 2015, the Ecnec approved a Tk 73.42-crore project for constructing infrastructures for the academy on the land of Rajshahi Central Jail. The prison compound is on 18.8819 acres, which is part of 65.4070 acres of the jail's property. Out of the rest 46.5251 acres, the authorities have allotted 37.1335 acres for the academy.      The Public Works Department began constructing the academy's infrastructure dividing the work into 12 packages in 2016. Construction of the administrative building, academic block, barracks for male and female trainees, quarters and dormitories for officials and staffers is going on. Floating of tender is underway for water supply, electrification, fire-fighting and tree plantation. The prison authorities have also proposed a 443-strong organogram for the academy to the home ministry. According to some official documents this correspondent managed to see, it was around the same time the Ecnec approved the project, the prison authorities proposed acquiring the 100-acre river land. And another proposal was sent in May last year. During a visit to Sreerampur, this correspondent saw that the prison authorities have put up more than half a dozen signboards on the flood control embankment of the river. The signboards declare the river land by the embankment as the proposed site for the academy. Two of the signboards carried description of the already occupied four acres of the river land. Below the embankment and towards the river on the south, the authorities demarcated a huge portion of the river land using bamboo poles with red and yellow flags, and set up a checkpoint in the middle. A sentry deployed there said the checkpoint has been in place since February 2017. \"You've to occupy your own land,\" the DIG prisons said, claiming that records show the four-acre river land belongs to them."

      "text": "It is difficult for farmers to develop a good marketing plan without proper market information, as is the case for managers of any industry. Fortunately, in today's day and age, digital technology can help the agriculture industry in many ways. From daily prices of agricultural products to costs of fertilisers, seeds and renting tractors, digital technology can help disseminate the market information that the farmers need. This timely information for agricultural commodities can assist farmers to not only plan production and harvesting dates, but also decide when and where to sell their products. While farmers can get to know current prices of their local markets through middlemen or by directly visiting the market places, at times, they do not receive the correct market information and get exploited. Proper market information gives farmers more bargaining power against middlemen. They can sell their products to different wholesalers or directly to the vegetable sellers in the market place if they know the availing prices.   The Department of Agricultural Marketing (DAM), a section of the Ministry of Agriculture, Bangladesh, updates the daily retailer and wholesaler prices for key agricultural commodities such as rice, fish, flour, betel leaves and vegetables, in addition to prices of seeds and fertilisers and many markets of several sub districts of Bangladesh.   Teaming up with the DAM, a group of undergraduate students, led by Mohammad Hassan, an adjunct lecturer of the Department of Economics & Banking at International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC), has taken steps to raise awareness about market data and enhance data literacy among the farmers, so that they can collect and interpret data to make informed decisions. Under the title, 'Sharing Market Data with Farmers', the project is currently covering the Sitakunda upazila in the Chattogram district. Predominantly funded by the initiators, the project was launched in November 2018. The activities of the project include teaching farmers how to see daily price data of specific products for a specific location, generate bar charts for monthly, weekly and yearly prices, and read and interpret the data charts. The project is designed to make things simpler for farmers so that they can easily use the DAM website and mobile app.  Farmers in Sitakunda have responded to the project positively. Mohammad Sayedul, who owns two poultry farms, uses the website to check the daily price of eggs. \"As an arable farmer, my father grows tomatoes and cabbages. He does not use a smartphone. Ever since I have come across this project, I let him know of the market prices with its help,\" says Rabiul Islam. \"I think it is also useful for buying vegetables from the market.\" The students who are a part of the project also shared their experiences. \"We are currently taking a course in Agricultural Economics with Mohammad Hassan,\" says Kawsar Ahmed. \"It is exciting to engage in real-world applications of agricultural practices. We work on the project during our time off from classes. We are also thankful to the IIUC family for encouraging us.\""

      "text": "The world celebrated Valentine's Day on 14 February. Wishes were exchanged, special parties were planned and dear ones were busy trying to do something beautiful on the occasion. But former Bhutan Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay won the Internet with a Valentine's Day photo posted on his official Facebook page. Tobgay, who was the Prime Minister of Bhutan from 2013 to 2018, is married to Tashi Dolma, who has accompanied him on many of his official foreign trips including a visit to India in 2015.  On Thursday, Tobgay shared a beautiful picture which quickly went viral. In the photo, Tobgay is seen in the front seat of a vehicle grimacing in pain as his wife, seated in the back seat, pulls on his ears. Tobgay captioned the photo with a Valentine's Day greeting and an emoji. The photo left the Internet in splits. The post garnered over 4K likes in less than 2 hours. Many wished the couple on Valentine's Day while some joked that Tashi is \"punishing\" Tobgay for his loss in last year's general elections. This is not the first time Tobgay won the Internet with a post featuring the couple. In September 2018, Tobgay, who is the president of People's Democratic Party (PDP) of Bhutan, had posted a photo on Twitter showing him carrying Tashi on his back through a muddy road. \"Not as dashing as Sir Walter Raleigh, but a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do to keep his lady's feet clean,\" Tobgay captioned the photo referring to the 17th century English nobleman. That post, too, went viral, attracting 5.5K likes and a flood of comments praising the former PM for his humility and love for his wife. The 53-year-old Tobgay completed his schooling in India and went for higher studies in the US. A keen environmentalist, he married Tashi in 1998. The couple have two children. His party badly lost the 2018 general elections in the landlocked country, finishing third in the first round and thereby losing all 32 seats in the 47 member House it had won in 2013.

      "text": "If Volkswagen realizes its ambition of becoming the global leader in electric cars, it will be thanks to a radical and risky bet born out of the biggest calamity in its history. The German giant has staked its future, to the tune of 80 billion euros ($91 billion), on being able to profitably mass-produce electric vehicles - a feat no carmaker has come close to achieving. So far mainstream automakers' electric plans have had one main goal: to protect profits gleaned from high-margin conventional cars by adding enough zero-emission vehicles to their fleet to meet clean-air rules. Customers have meanwhile largely shunned electric vehicles because they are too expensive, can be inconvenient to charge and lack range. The biggest strategy shift in Volkswagen's 80 years has its roots in a weekend crisis meeting at the Rothehof guesthouse in Wolfsburg on October 10, 2015, senior executives told Reuters. At the meeting hosted by then VW brand chief Herbert Diess, nine top managers gathered on a cloudy Saturday afternoon to discuss the way forward after regulators blew the whistle on the company's emissions cheating, a scandal that cost it more than 27 billion euros in fines and tainted its name. \"It was an intense discussion, so was the realization that this could be an opportunity, if we jump far enough,\" said Juergen Stackmann, VW brand's board member for sales. \"It was an initial planning session to do more than just play with the idea of electric cars,\" he told Reuters. \"We asked ourselves: what is our vision for the future of the brand? Everything that you see today is connected to this.\" Just three days after the Rothehof meeting of the VW brand's management board, Volkswagen announced plans to develop an electric vehicle platform, codenamed MEB, paving the way for mass production of an affordable electric car. For months after the Volkswagen scandal blew up in 2015, rival carmakers treated diesel-cheating as a \"VW issue\", according to industry experts. But regulators have since uncovered excessive emissions across the sector and unleashed a clampdown that undermines the business case for combustion engines, forcing a sector-wide rethink. Now the \"villain\" of dieselgate is likely to become the largest producer of electric cars in the world in coming years, analysts say, putting it in pole position to flood the market - should the demand materialize. \"Decisions to convert the Emden factory (in Lower Saxony) to build electric cars, would never have happened without this Saturday meeting,\" said Stackmann, one of five senior VW executives who spoke to Reuters. However the full scale of VW's ambitions were only revealed two months ago when it took the industry by surprise by pledging to spend 80 billion euros to develop electric vehicles and buy batteries, dwarfing the investment of rivals. It plans to raise annual production of electric cars to 3 million by 2025, from 40,000 in 2018. It's a risky bet. With regulators and lawmakers, rather than customers, dictating what kind of vehicles can hit the road, analysts at Deloitte say the industry could produce 14 million electric cars for which there is no consumer demand. It's also an all-or-nothing bet in the long run. VW, whose ID electric car will hit showrooms in 2020, has set a deadline for ending mass production of combustion engines. The final generation of gasoline and diesel engines will be developed by 2026."

Local people said the bridge, which connects four upazilas--Mymensingh Sadar, Trishal, Gouripur and Ishwarganj--is located in remote Moricharchar area along the Old Brahmaputra river under Uchakhila union of the upazila. In 2016, Local Government Engineering Department built the bridge spending Tk 16 lakh to ease communication between Khodaboxpur, Bhabokhali and Bhola Algi villages and the upazila headquarters after a portion of Moricharchar area was devoured by the Brahmaputra river. However, the approach roads on both sides of the bridge were washed away by the flood the following year. Uchakhila Union Parishad (UP) Chairman Shafiqul Islam said although villagers in cooperation with the local UP rebuilt the approach roads by filling earth and dumping sand bags, within a short time the temporary approach roads were eroded again. Villagers later erected a bamboo-made platform connecting the bridge, which also broke down shortly after, the UP chairman said. College student Emdadul Haque said the bridge is the only means for them to cross Moricharchar area and reach the upazila headquarters. Though the area is famous for vegetable farming round the year, it is very difficult for thousands of farmers to carry their produce to local markets using the bridge, he added. The bridge was built to mitigate the sufferings of the village people, but it is no longer usable for them, farmer Motiur Rahman of Moricharchar area said.  Echoing the same, a number of farmers like Nazrul Islam, Monjurul Haque, Azizul Islam and Abdul Halim of the area said they are often deprived of fair prices for their produce due to lack of direct communication to Ishwarganj upazila headquarters and Mymensingh town. There are some five educational institutions, including a primary and a high school, on either sides of the bridge, ward member Golam Mustafa said, adding that around 400 students have to cross the bridge daily. Ishwarganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Umme Rumana said she was informed of the matter recently, adding that necessary steps will be taken soon to mitigate the trouble."

      "text": "A new research shows coastal flooding will hit nearly 42 million people in Bangladesh by 2050, meaning that the situation is likely to be worse than what was feared earlier. The number of victims could reach 57 million by the end of this century, according to the study conducted by US-based non-profit research group Climate Central and published in British scientific journal Nature on Tuesday. A previous projection by the group had said the flooding would affect around 5 million Bangladeshis living in coastal areas by the mid-century. Some other studies, however, said the number could be 20 to 30 million. The new study says researchers have developed a more accurate way of estimating the effects of sea level rise over large areas, and found that nearly 300m people across the world will be vulnerable by 2050 to flooding made worse by climate change. Globally, more than three times more people are at risk from rising sea levels than previously believed, the researchers suggest. \"When we use our new elevation data, we find far more people living in vulnerable areas than we previously understood,\" the study's co-author Ben Strauss, CEO and chief scientist of Climate Central, told AFP. Eminent Bangladeshi climate expert Saleemul Haq agreed with the study findings. He, however, said, \"It needs further research at the national level to know exactly what will happen in Bangladesh.\" 'ASIA TO BE HIT HARDEST' The new study, which contains findings from individual assessments of 135 countries across multiple climate scenarios and years, says deadly storm surges, cyclones and rising sea would hit Asia the hardest. More than two thirds of the vulnerable populations live in some countries of Asia, including Bangladesh, China, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand, says the study, titled \"New Elevation Data Triple Estimates of Global Vulnerability to Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Flooding\". A map created using a form of artificial intelligence, known as neural networks, shows that by 2050 some coastal cities from South and South East Asia will be under water during high tide. Millions of people living in the cities of those countries, including Dhaka, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taizhou, Surabaya, Mumbai, Ho Chi Minh City and Osaka -- would find themselves in flood zones, the report mentions. \"These assessments show the potential of climate change to reshape cities, economies, coastlines, and entire global regions within our lifetimes,\" said Dr Scott Kulp, a senior scientist at Climate Central and lead author of the study. Dr Benjamin Strauss said, \"For most of the global coasts we didn't know the height of the ground beneath our feet.\" The researchers used a model called CoastalDEM digital elevation modelling, a new digital elevation model developed by Climate Central, for the study. Earlier, researchers had used Nasa's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) which gave an estimation of population at risk due to sea level rise three times lower than the current one. Although the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) in its sixth report published last month projected that sea level would go up by a metre by the end of the century, the new report says the height will rise by at least two metres. Contacted, Dr Atik Rahman, executive director of Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS), one of the lead authors of IPCC, said the panel projected the sea level rise based on old published papers. \"So the IPCC did not project the sea level rise correctly. Actually the sea level is rising more rapidly as Arctic, Antarctic and mountain glaciers are melting faster than we thought,\" he said. \"So the impact of climate change is going to be harder than we thought.\" Meanwhile, some experts differ from the study findings relating to Bangladesh. Dr Ainun Nishat, professor emeritus, Brac University, said most of the coastal areas in the country have embankments which are four to five metres high and the government has taken initiatives to increase the height to 6.5 metres. \"So the areas, as projected in the new study, are not going to be inundated,\" he said. The expert believed areas 100 kilometres away from the coastal zones in districts like Pirojpur and Shariatpur would be badly affected as there are no embankments there. \"But for us, the main challenge would be the increasing salinity in the river water due to the rising sea level and tackling natural disasters with what we have,\" he added."

      "text": "Imagine a Japanese man in Dhaka in the first decade of the twentieth century bent on being employed in the town and ending up marrying a Bengali Brahmo woman, the daughter of a soap factory owner, who has offered him a job. Think of the woman later going to a village near Nagoya with her husband (now a soap factory owner himself in Dhaka) to visit her in-laws, a few years before the First World War erupts. Imagine next the woman accompanying her husband to Japan once more at the outbreak of the Second World War, since the Japanese man is afraid of being jailed in British India. There she meets Netaji Subhas Bose and is thrilled by his vision of an independent homeland liberated from the British with the help of the Japanese Army. Picture, if you will her broadcasting in Bengali on Netaji's behalf on wartime Japanese radio. Consider now the prospects, years after her death, of the discovery of two manuscripts of the woman's visits, one published in her lifetime, but the other surviving only in manuscript form, recovered from oblivion and published devotedly by successive scholars/editors, and even a film made on her by an eminent Bangladeshi filmmaker.  And imagine finally a book in English that gathers almost everything available by and on this remarkable Brahmo woman so that readers can piece together her life and see it in its proper context. As readers of the book under review will agree once they have finished with it, truth is at times stronger than fiction! The Journey of a Bengali Woman to Japan is a noteworthy work centering on Hariprabha Mallick Takeda, a Bengali woman (1890-1972), who was married off to Oemon Takeda, a Japanese national employed in her father's soap factory in 1907 by her enlightened Brahmo father. At the time of marriage, she was looking after a home for abandoned girls and destitute women in Dhaka's Nimtali. She and Takeda visited Japan for four months in 1912-13; her account of the trip was published as Banga Mohilar Japan Jatra in 1915. The couple had no children but was happily settled in Dhaka, where Takeda had done well as the owner of a factory manufacturing glycerin soap. Her third trip lasted seven years (there was a second trip in 1924 that has gone unrecorded) and shows a Japan first being devastated by its war efforts, and in real bad shape afterwards The rediscovery of Hariprabha's writings has been a continuous affair. The Bangladeshi scholar Monzurul Huq located a copy of the first and only book published by her sister, Santiprabha Mullick in 1915 in London's Indian Office Library and later on, brought out an edition of it in 1999; two more editions were published later in Delhi (2007) and Kolkata (2009) by others. The handwritten manuscript of her experience in Japan at the time of the Second World War was discovered after her death by Surojit Dasgupta, the nephew she lived with in the final years of her life, and was published with the book on her first trip by Manjushree Sinha from Kolkata in 2009. Sinha's edition also contains another hitherto undiscovered work in Bengali by Hariprabha titled \"Child Rearing and Women's Education in Japan,\" originally published in the journal Bharatbarsha in 1949. What Somdatta Mandal has done so well is not only to translate these three manuscripts into English but also append them with a translation of an essay by Monzurul Huq introducing the first two works, an original essay by Kazuhiro Watanabe titled, \"The Japan that Hariprabha Saw,\" a translation of select compilation of articles by Swapan Prasanna Roy that he had written for his 2007 Delhi edition of the first two works, and a translation of the Introduction Sinha had written for her 2009 Kolkata edition. Obviously fascinated by everything she was finding out in the research she had undertaken to bring out her translations of Hariprabha's writings, Mandal follows up her translations and the contextual comments of previous editors and Watanabe with further translations of the \"Reminiscences\" of Hariprabha's nephew Surojit and his wife Manju Dasgupta of their \"Baro Mashi\" (eldest aunt). For good measure, Mandal also includes a review of Tanvir Mokammel's 2012 documentary Japani Bodhu (\"Japanese Bride\"), and reprints a scholarly piece by Gautam Neogi on the home for abandoned and destitute women Hariprabha managed till 1908. Of the works by Hariprabha, the first and longest is a fairly straightforward account of the voyage she took on shipboard with her husband to Japan and the people she met during her extended stay with her in-laws. She clearly has an eye for details and a mind that can organize them as well as the capacity to write simply. As a Brahmo, she takes occasional metaphysical leaps that stand out in her narrative. For example, when the ship she is in is leaving the river and entering the sea, she is impressed by the time it takes the vessel to reach blue water and views it as the wait humans are destined to experience in uniting with the Almighty.  In a Japanese temple she is eager to see the \"idol-less God [that] resides in this huge temple.\" There are things in Hariprabha's narratives clearly meant to be seen as exemplary for her Bengali readers. When she visits a girl's school she notes that the little children there are \"not taught with the aid of books\" but are \"given basic ethical training through stories\" and made to learn through activities like clay modeling and drawing. She obviously liked seeing Japanese women spending no more than half a day doing house work. She is also impressed here (and in the second account) by the cleanliness of the Japanese, observing their addiction to taking frequent public baths, their obsession with keeping public places clean, and not littering anything anytime anywhere. She records too how the Japanese, for their part, are fascinated by the presence of a Bengali woman in their midst, who, for her part, was obviously \"basking in the love and attention of everyone.\" While I liked reading the account of her first trip, I must confess that I found her description of her stay in war-torn Japan much more appealing. Her depiction of a people scarred mentally and having to undergo endless hardship because of war-time scarcity, of landscapes being devastated by enemy bombings, and of unending deaths can be quite moving as when she writes, \"The houses of the ordinary people of Japan were full of sorrow--husbands and sons dead, children dead of starvation, no food, no clothes, no roof above their heads.\" And yet she notes the courtesy and kindness with which she and her ageing husband are treated by the Japanese, as when they queued for food rations. At one point she and her increasingly infirm husband are forced to live in the corner of a godown. The second account attracted me a lot more than the first one also because of the glimpses it affords of Netaji and the Azad Hind in Japan. We find him sitting with Hariprabha in his car in Tokyo, hear him declare that his group would fight for India's independence till the end, and learn of the death of Netaji himself on a plane on the way (presumably) to India from Bangkok. True, what we have in Hariprabha's unpublished memoir are only such scattered references, but they seem to me to be, nevertheless, invaluable. As for Hariprabha's third work where she writes on Japanese women and children, one notices the implicit criticism of Bengalis in this regard and her admiration for the Japanese. This seems to be the case when she notes the use of diapers by mothers and the way they carry their children on their backs or avoid hitting them, transmitting well their \"nurturing instincts\" to the young ones. She obviously admires the schooling in politeness girls receive in schools. In this post-war essay, however, there is also an indication of her regret in the manner Japanese women were beginning to imitate American ways. Somdatta Mandal has done admirable work not only in translating Hariprabha's works so lucidly but also in her intelligent selection of selected contextual comments of other translators and scholars. Her translation and scholarship are evidence of her admiration for the unique experience of this Bengali Brahmo woman from Dhaka in Japan. My only regret after ending the book is that although Mandal and Jadavpur University Press appeared to have done their best to bring out a very attractive edition, there are no clear photos/portraits of Hariprabha in Dhaka, Japan, or West Bengal (where she lived after partition and her return from Japan) in The Journey of a Bengali Woman to Japan. But that could be because of a flood in Darjeeling which ruined whatever the widowed woman had in her trunk in the last stage of her life.

      "text": "14 Bede families have set up their oval-shaped makeshift tents on private land in Natun Torki, a village in Kalkini Upazila of Madaripur district. A branch of the Arialkha river flows on the west of Natun Torki. The area is well-known in Barishal for Torki Bandar, a narrow but flowing river on the west. The Bede huts are just on the outskirts of the crowded Natun Torki market. Soud Khan, a Bede Sardar from Kharia in Munshiganj, and two other Bedes--Md Zakir Hossain and Md Nurun Nabi--guide me into their tents, many in the open space and some under the shade of a tree. It is a bright, sunny afternoon in June 29, 2018. Each tent seems to have everything a family needs, all crammed into a 100 to 150 square-feet space. Most tents are also fitted with solar panels. The tents facing west glow in the golden sunshine. It is Friday, an off-day here. I inspect the tents and take photos in the daylight before finally sitting down for a chat with the elderly Bedes, surrounded by everyone of the little Bede community. Md Zakir Hossain, in his late forties, informs me that all 14 families there had started their journey from Khari in Munshiganj in October 2017. Since then they have set up their tents and set up businesses in 14 places! Their journey through these months saw them moving through Shariatpur, Madaripur, Barguna, Jhalakathi and Barishal. Before coming to Natun Torki, they spent a month and ten days in the Doari Bridge area in Barishal.  \"We stay in an area for as long as the business is good,\" says Hossain, admitting that the business is actually not that good anywhere. \"We survive on minimal income and the scope of business dries out pretty quickly. So, we keep moving.\" The 14 families are all Mal Manta, one of a dozen groups among the Bede. One main business of the female Mal Bede is making use of singe, a metal pipe that sucks out bad blood from the human body to give relief from pain. Other businesses of Mal Bede include the search of lost gold, and sale of imitation ornaments, cosmetics, amulets, cups and other light utensils. Hossain and his group plan to stay at Natun Torki for no longer than two weeks. They do not think business will be good here. I call Hossain some 20 days after I meet them to check if they have moved on. \"Yes, we are now at Haturia Launch Ghat in Goshairhat Thana under Shariatpur district,\" he tells me. \"We stayed at Natun Torki for 15 days.\" The life of the Bedes is tough indeed. \"Because we are always on the run, our children cannot attend school,\" laments Rubina Akhtar, 45, explaining that none of the 25 children of the 14 families receive education.  \"Many years back, Father Renato, a Catholic priest, used to assist us and had a school that would travel with us,\" recalls Rubina's husband Nurun Nabi, 55, who had been a teacher of the floating school. Nurun Nabi studied up to class ten and is ready to teach the Bede children again.  \"Give us a school and a teacher,\" Rubina demands of me repeatedly. \"We want education for our children.\" When I mention that Bangladesh reportedly has a 100 percent enrollment for children, Rubina shouts in disagreement, \"It is a lie.\" A large percentage of the Bede is on the move like these 14 families; and their children do not get any education. About 15 years ago, these groups used to glide through the country in boats. Their economic condition was better back then. Now, none them have a boat. Grambangla Unnayan Committee, a non-profit organisation that works closely with Bedes, estimates that there are 5,000 Bede groups roaming around the country for 10 months around the year. Then they assemble at 75 locations in 39 districts. Normally, they get together during Eid-ul-Azha or national and local elections. Most of them were not allowed to vote until 2007.However, a great percentage of Bede households do not have land or houses where they are registered as voters. They simply carry their tents everywhere. According to a survey by the NGO, more than 90 percent of Bedes are illiterate. An overwhelming percentage live below the poverty line. Very few children are vaccinated. As they change locations often, they do not enjoy any government family welfare schemes or health assistance. Although they belong to the poorest of the poor and are landless, they hardly get khas land for settlement. Their access to safety net programmes such as old age allowance, VGF cards, disability allowance, flood relief etc. is minimal. Before visiting Natun Torki, we also spend hours at Torki Char Bede Palli. The hamlet is located along a half kilometer stretch on a western branch of the Arialkha river that snakes through Torki Bandar. The Bede hamlet, with its two-storey concrete and wooden houses, is neat and clean. Some houses, of course, reveal the poverty of the 60 families staying there. The shabbier houses are built like boats on plinths, perhaps in fond memory of their long-lost boats. The differences between the well-off and poorer Bede are clearly visible. Md Nannu Sarder tells me that in addition to the 60 families settled on tiny plots of land purchased as far back as 25 years ago, another 60 to 70 families assembled here on boats for two months in October. Torki Char Bazar is home for them. Some families have small plots of land but they are yet to build houses. For a month or two in October and November they relax, organise parties with singing and dancing, repair their boats, and settle social matters such as disputes and marriages. \"About half of the 70 families who don't own houses and have their boats under repair set up tents,\" explains the Sardar (leader of the Bede hamlet). The hamlet grows lively with the assembled crowds. But during business season, most working men and women go out to sell their business ware. Some women roam around with singe leaving the hamlet nearly empty. Beside the village, the river flows quietly--lifeblood of the wandering people, eager to settle down as agriculturists.  \"But we have been able to purchase only tiny plots of land on which to build our houses,\" says Nannu Sarder, his strong features not once reveal his age of 75. \"None of us have agricultural land.\" This is a change they want now. \"Once we settle down, our children can go to school,\" asserts Nannu. Two of Sarder's friends--Md Jahangir and Md Abdur Rab--join us as we chat. They reminisce about their life 25 years back, when they all had boats. \"We used to come here twice a year since 1972. The river had a magnetic power. We would repair our boats here,\" recalls Md Jahangir, 65, who was the first to buy five decimals of land for Tk 40,000 back in the day. \"The local Gale (non-Bede Bangalee) offered to sell land to us,\" says Md Jahangir. Others followed Jahangir too. The Manta of Torki Char Bede Palli in Gournadi Pourashava are all from Amanatganj, Barishal, and all are Muslims. They believe that they are different from Bedes of Dhaka Division and other areas. Soud Khan of Kharia in Munshiganj who accompanied us agrees. \"I can see the Bede of Barishal are the homely kind,\" observes Khan. The benefit of a permanent address is clear. However, even after settling down, they face social difficulties with the Gale. \"They look down upon us and do not want to socialise with us,\" says Nannu Sarder. \"We pray in separate mosques and we do not mix with the Gale who envy our economic well-being.\" Relations between the Bede and Gale turned bitter after a fight two years ago. Like the Bede who have settled in the Torki Bandar area, other Bede groups are also trying to settle on land. One such group is seen in Kakalia village in the Nagari union of Kaliganj upazila in Gazipur. Even a year and half ago, around 60 Bedes had boats beautifully lined up in the Turag river close to the Tongi-Ghorashal Highway. At one time, 200 boats would float in this part of the Turag, serving as a reminder of the river gypsy tradition in riverine Bengal. But in July 2018, only eight boats were left. Quite a few of the awnings were set on the land close to the river. Others have disappeared from the river with signs of dilapidation around. Around 60 families have now built their houses on khas land on the Turag bank. The majority of the families have built tin shed houses, some with concrete floor. One family has constructed a two-storey home with a wooden deck--a typical house of a well-off Bede family. Others have set the awnings of their boats right on the banks of Turag. Mosammat Rezia, 70, born and brought up on a boat, feels sad about the boat life that has recently ended for her and others. She has sold cosmetics and ornaments on foot all her life, a typical mode of work for Sandar Manta women. She has two sons who sell cosmetics and supplement their income by fishing in the Belai beel and river during monsoon.  \"We are destitute,\" sighs Rezia. \"We have to buy everything except for water.\" The families, however, have received two concrete toilets and one tubewell from the government.\" Land and agriculture are mirages to the Bede of Kakalia or elsewhere. 60 Bede families have settled on 51 decimals of khas land; but not for free. Abu Miah, Tabu Miah and Ali have taken yearly leases of 20 decimals of land and divided it into 10 tiny plots. Fazlul Haque, Rezia's son, took one of the plots for BDT 8,000 15 years ago. Others have taken plots for between BDT 40,000 and BDT 50,000.  It is here that we find Nuru Miah, aged 110. He stoops low, yet he walks fast and his eyesight is perfect. Born in Demra, he came here 10 years back. His wife Gedi Begum is 90 years old. Both husband and wife were born, and have spent all their life, on boats.  \"Since then we have set the awnings of our boat on land and we live under it,\" he says, pointing to the oval-shaped structure that he set up after his boat broke. Everybody in the little hamlet is sympathetic to the aged couple. A few families in Kakalia that still live there will soon abandon their boats. \"We do not want to go back,\" says Sadhina Begum, 47, who with a son and two daughters left their boat about a year back. Sadhina's son works at a garment factory at College Gate, 10 minutes away from Kakalia. Like Sadhina's son, 15 other young boys and girls go to work in the nearby garment factory. A much bigger group of Sandar Bede, around 320 families, have been living on the Turag bank attached to the Tongi bridge. It is actually an age-old Bede slum comprising small huts crammed on a narrow strip of public land. The men of this Bede squalid are in the fish trade. They buy fish from Abdullahpur, Jatrabari, Karwan Bazar, etc and sell it in the local market. \"The Turag was wider and clearer in the past,\" says octogenarian Ismail, \"but now it is too polluted with hardly any fish to catch.\" The women, as usual, sell cosmetics and utensils in villages far and near. Bedana, aged 70, sits in front of her hut in great despair. She has heard that many of the Bede houses would have to be dismantled for the construction of another bridge in Tongi. \"We have no land and no means. We do not know where to go if we are required to move out,\" says Bedana. When I checked with Giashuddin Sarker, councillor of Ward No. 57, Gazipur City Corporation, in late September last year, he reported that, \"94 Bede families have already been evicted for Tongi bridge construction. They have taken shelter in their relatives' houses and a few families have gone to Savar Bede villages.\"  Other Sandars at Tongi are equally concerned. In fact, this has Bedes all around the country concerned. They want change in their lifestyles. They want to settle on land and become agriculturists. It is a century-old desire as reflected in W.W. Hunter's writing on Bediyas around a century and half ago: \"They mostly wander about in boats, and subsist by jugglery and thieving, but some of them have now settled down as agriculturists.\" However, Bede life on land is not easy. Unemployment and social ills such as drug addiction thrived in Bede villages. But years back, things began to improve with the help of a police officer, Habibur Rahman, then a superintendent police of Dhaka and now a deputy inspector general of police. The police official appeared as a great friend to the Bede. \"He motivated the drug addicts and dealers in the villages to engage in productive work,\" says Ramjan Ahmed, an educated Bede leader from Badda and managing director of Uttaran Fashion, a small garment factory that exclusively employs Bede girls and boys. \"Many girls who previously charmed snakes and sold cosmetics now operate modern sewing machines and make clothes for export.\" The factory is also a training ground. \"So far 105 girls and boys have been trained and about 50 of them work at the factory,\" states Ramjan Ahmed. \"The factory keeps training girls with a financial incentive. They seek work in other factories after learning the skills of the trade. This is how many are transitioning from traditional work to modern-day work.\"  \"The profits are spent on the welfare of the Bedes,\" says Habibur Rahman, who has a comprehensive plan for the Bedes of Savar in particular. A primary school dedicated for the Bede children is months away. A cluster village on about four acres of land for the landless Bede is becoming visible on the other side of the Bongshi river, which was the life blood of the Bede not long ago. With Habibur Rahman's initiative, 36 young people have learned to drive. Many others have passed the test to become police officers and got other jobs. He set up four schools in Khari in Munshiganj, and also helps when Bedes face trouble anywhere in the country.  \"I also want to set up a Bede museum in Savar where people will see the Bede artefacts and learn about their history,\" says Habibur Rahman with confidence. The Bedes are clear enough on one thing: they are falling behind in the race for progress. They realise if their nomadic existence continues, they cannot send their children to schools, access public health services and attain skills to move out of extreme poverty. So, their appeal to the state is that they are permanently allocated some khas land or that arrangements are made so that they can purchase small plots in areas they feel comfortable to live in.

      "text": "The Rohingya crisis, water-sharing of 54 common rivers and the National Register of Citizens of India will feature prominently in talks during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's four-day visit to Delhi starting tomorrow. The PM will be visiting the country at the invitation of her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi. Hasina is also scheduled to attend the India Economic Summit of the World Economic Forum (WEF) as the chief guest on Friday and meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi the next day. This will be the second meeting of the premiers of the two neighbouring countries following their first meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on September 27 after their re-election.   \"Though our prime minister will be attending the summit, her meeting with the Indian prime minister is very important as there are a number of issues regarding the India-Bangladesh relations,\" said a foreign ministry official. The issues that will be discussed by the two include sharing of water of 54 common rivers; use of waterways; maritime cooperation; the Rohingya crisis and National Register of Citizens (NRC), he told The Daily Star. Apart from a number of agreements that are to be made during the visit, the two PMs will also jointly inaugurate three bilateral projects via a video conference.  The PM's visit to India comes after her visit to China in July and Japan in May, when the Rohingya crisis was one of the most important issues of the discussions, apart from trade. ROHINGYA CRISIS Two years after more than 743,000 Rohingyas fled a military crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state and took shelter in Bangladesh and despite two repatriation attempts, Rohingyas have refused to return to Myanmar without the guarantee of citizenship and safety. India, China and Japan have worked to find a bilateral solution to the Rohingya crisis, but are yet to create pressure on Myanmar to solve the crisis. \"Bangladesh is facing a formidable challenge regarding the Rohingyas. As a powerful neighbour, Bangladesh wants India's active role to help address the crisis,\" said the foreign ministry official, requesting anonymity. WATER SHARING AND WATERWAYS Water resources ministry officials said Bangladesh would raise the issue of Teesta water-sharing agreement and sharing of waters of other common rivers. A framework for water-sharing of eight rivers may be signed. The rivers include the Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Feni, Gumti, Dharla, Dudhkumar and Teesta.  Besides, the two sides will also discuss enhancing cooperation in flood forecasting and basin-wide river management, they said. The Teesta water-sharing agreement could not be signed between India and Bangladesh during former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Bangladesh in 2011 due to objections from West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Though the two countries have 54 common rivers, there is only one water- sharing treaty on the Ganges. \"As a lower riparian country, Bangladesh should hammer on the water issue on a regular basis. We are talking about river basin management, but there is no progress on it for years though there were similar talks years ago,\" said eminent water expert Dr Ainun Nishat.  A water resources ministry official said siltation was occurring in southern Bangladesh due to inadequate flow of water from the upstream during the lean season. Joint dredging of rivers by Bangladesh and India can be considered on a pilot basis under the river basin management.  India wants to bring Bangladesh into its coastal radar chain network, reports The Hindu newspaper of India.  A standard of operating procedures on the use of Mongla and Chattogram ports for transporting Indian goods through Bangladesh is also likely to be signed during the PM's visit, shipping ministry officials said.   NRC  Assam's NRC, which excluded 1.9 million people in its final list, has been considered both by Bangladesh and India as an \"internal matter of India\". During a meeting between Hasina and Modi in New York last Friday, Modi said there was nothing to worry about it. Indian Home Minister and BJP President Amit Shah, however, repeatedly said \"illegal Bangalees\" would be deported. Asked, Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen recently said, \"The issue will be raised as there are concerns among some people.\" Experts say Bangladesh must seek clarification from India on the issue because the country has already been burdened with Rohingya refugees. INDIAN LINE OF CREDIT  Foreign ministry officials said Dhaka wants speedy disbursement of Indian Lines of Credit (LoC) as projects under the three LoCs, worth around $7.5 billion, have been facing delays mainly due to technical and bureaucratic reasons. In the last eight years, Bangladesh has managed to use $523 million of the first LoC worth $862 million, despite various steps to expedite utilisation of the funds. Bangladesh has so far used $14 million of the $2-billion second LoC.  India is yet to disburse any money from the $4.5-billion third LoC, officials said. Foreign Minister Momen recently said he asked the officials concerned to take the stock of projects and find ways to speed them up. India's Exim Bank, a state body to manage public loans, which opened its representative office in Dhaka in 2017, may now open a permanent office in the capital to process the total Indian LoC amounting to $7.5 billion, finance ministry officials said. The issue will be discussed during the PM's visit, Momen told The Daily Star.  According to the BSS, Hasina will have a joint meeting with three leaders from the Indian Chamber of Commerce and exchange views with them on Friday.  Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will call on the Bangladesh PM on Saturday morning. After a meeting between the two premiers on Saturday, Hasina will join a lunch to be hosted by the Indian PM in her honour. Hasina will then call on the Indian President Ram Nath Kovind. Besides, Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat is likely to call on Hasina on Friday while the Bangladesh premier is likely to meet Indian Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Sunday.  Hasina will also join a reception and a dinner to be hosted by the Bangladesh High Commission in India on October 3 on its premises in her honour. Foreign envoys along with ambassadors currently accredited to Bangladesh and other dignitaries will join the reception and dinner."

Local people also participated in the programme jointly organised by Abalambon, a voluntary organisation, and Human Rights Programme of UNDP at Mahmudbagh Islamia High School ground around 4:00pm today, our local correspondent reports.   The programme included discussion meeting, oath taking, debate competition and cultural events. The programme would enable students to learn how to behave with children, women, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities with fairness, speakers said. Education is not only for becoming doctors and engineers, but the students should also learn humanity from education, they said. The speakers also urged all the students to be loyal to the country's constitution and human rights and not to get involved in terrorism, militancy, drug addiction and corruption. They also called upon all to play a vital role in building the country in the spirit of the great Liberation War. The students also pledged to behave respectfully with the elderly and with the people of other communities, and agreed to be fair to all irrespective of religion and caste. The two-day event started yesterday when contestants from each school participated in debates and other events. On the concluding day, artists of ethnic and Bangalee communities performed in cultural events today. The programme was presided over by Shafique Mahmud Golap, president of the managing committee of the school. Philimon Baske, president of Shahebgan-Bagda Farm Bhumi Uddher Sangram Committee; Sadequl Islam, agriculturist; Anjali Rani Devi, human rights activist; Rumilla Hembrom, debate coordinator; Abdus Samad, principal of the school; and British Soren, adivasi jubo leader, spoke during the event among others."

Over 15 thousand people in the five upazilas have been affected by the flood. They lost their homes, croplands and livelihoods, and had to seek shelter in flood protection embankments and became scattered to different areas in the district for survival.  Shahitan Begum, 60, of Pachil village under Shahzadpur upazila, lost her home in the flood last month and is now living in a small makeshift shanty on a piece of rented land near the village market. She no longer affords food twice a day as the flood and river erosion took away everything she had. \"When the village got flooded, I could not save food grains, furniture and money at my home. Now my home no longer exists as the hungry Jamuna devoured my homestead and everything of my family-owned. I am struggling to survive as I have nothing and there is also no work for me,\" Shahitan said. \"We are barely surviving with minimum food; in most of the days we don't get to eat twice due to the lack of food grains,\" she lamented. \"At a time when it is costly to even survive barely, Eid festivities have no meaning to us,\" Shahitan said adding \"our joy of Eid got washed away into the river.\" Johura Begum, another flood victim of the same village now living at a temporary flood shelter near the village market, also echoed what Shahitan had said. \"We are struggling to manage food for everyone in the family for the last couple of months as the recent flood washed away all we had. Eid hardly means anything anymore,\" Johura said.   \"We feel happy if we can manage just some rice and salt to eat for the whole family,\" she said. \"Amid such destitute situation, the joy of Eid with new clothes and tasty food items seem too farfetched for us. Eid cannot make us happy anymore,\" Johura added. A total of 15,434 people from over 3,079 families of 408 villages in the five upazilas were greatly affected having lost everything in the recent flood. Meanwhile, another 3,13,997 people in the district were partially affected by the flood, according to the Sirajganj relief and rehabilitation office. A total of 6,505 houses were entirely damaged while 44,013 houses were partially damaged during the flood. Talking to The Daily Star, Hasen Ali, a resident of Ghatabari village under Enayetpur upazila, urged the authorities concerned to provide them relief materials and rehabilitation for their survival. \"Victims like us, who have lost everything in the recent flood in last one month, need more relief materials and rehabilitation so that we can return to our normal life,\" he said. Dr Faruk Ahmed, deputy commissioner of Sirajganj district, told The Daily Star that they have already submitted a report about the flood damage to the ministry concerned for getting fund for rehabilitation of the victims."

Launched by the USAID GeoCenter and three universities in 2015, it has grown into a global network of 163 university chapters with over 5000 students. \"We don't build maps, we build mappers\" is their official motto, as they attempt to cultivate a generation of young leaders to create resilient communities. Their leadership fellow programmes, research fellow programmes and virtual internships are beneficial to both students and faculty members for self-development. Maliha Binte Mohiuddin from University of Dhaka began her journey with YouthMappers in 2016, shortly after she wrote a blog entry titled, \"Mapping is like a box of chocolates\", for one of their programmes. Consequently, she was selected as a Leadership Fellow in 2017 and attended a seven-day training session in Nepal, where she also received the Best Blog certificate. In 2018, she was selected for a five-month training programme in Manila, under the National NGO Program for Humanitarian Leadership, organised by Concern Worldwide. She was the youngest representative at International Medical Corps and Harvard Humanitarian Initiatives. YouthMappers works around mapping for humanitarian matters and projects like malaria prevention, food security and resilience against natural calamities. Everyone at YouthMappers is engaged with remote and field mapping sectors. Maliha regards mapping to be an exciting activity for young students, as it enables them to utilise different areas of knowledge and turn them into diagrams. Her current job as the Regional Ambassador is to aid in the process of creating new chapters through local communication with the youth in Asia. Maliha is also involved with their Let Girls Map campaign for bringing aspiring female mappers to the forefront. She recently organised a workshop at Daffodil International University where she taught the students about mapping and worked on a project based on flood resilience in Noakhali. \"We used the Kobo Toolbox, field paper and Mapillary app. With the help of two female volunteers from University of Dhaka, Nowshin Afrose and Sabiha Muna, the programme was a great success,\" she shared. Presently, there are twelve chapters of the network at different institutions across Bangladesh, including University of Dhaka, Dhaka College, Eastern University, Jahangirnagar University, Asian University of Women, Daffodil International University and State University of Bangladesh.  Maliha had Dr Patricia Soils, Director and Principal Investigator of YouthMappers, as her mentor, when she started out. She strongly believes that the platform has given her the encouragement and strength to pursue her goals as a humanitarian in the long run. She is grateful to YouthMappers for equipping her with valuable life skills. Maliha recently presented her paper, Elevating the Skills of Youth Through the Humanitarian Remote Mapping with the Thrive of YouthMappers Network, as one of the keynote speakers at the 3rd International Conference on Natural Hazards and Disaster Management, held in Japan. She has also contributed to the engagement of students at Keio University and Okayama University of Science, with the goal of affiliating them with the YouthMappers network."

      "text": "International Classic Composite Ltd (ICCL) has been facing troubles to invest Tk 250 crore, as the Dhaka's development authority is not allowing the Bangladesh-Netherlands joint venture knitwear company to use its own land for factory expansion. The company has an export-oriented factory occupying half of the area of its 12-bigha land at Naojur in Gazipur.  It has been trying to set up another knitwear factory using the rest of the land.  In 2015, the company sought approval from the Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) to use the land for industrial purposes. The city's development authority said the proposed land is an arable land under its Detailed Area Plan (DAP). As per Rajuk's recommendation, the company then submitted an application to change the status of the land from farmland to an industrial one, said MA Muttaleeb (Khokan), managing director of ICCL. \"But the Rajuk has been delaying to give approval. Now our Dutch investor is threatening to withdraw the investment from Bangladesh due to the delay in implementation of the project.\" On November 27 this year, the commerce ministry came up to rescue the company and sent a letter to Rajuk with a request to allow ICCL to use the land. The Daily Star obtained a copy of the letter. \"This is my own land and I want to expand my operations. Rajuk should assist me, but it has not been doing it,\" said Khokan who has been exporting knitwear items worth more than $35 million a year employing nearly 5,000 workers. He also said if the proposed factory is set up, another some 5,000 workers could be employed and the export value will also increase. \"I have a lot of work orders from the international buyers, so I want to expand my operations,\" said Khokan who has been catering work orders for European brands Zara, Next and Bestseller. Earlier, the factory owners in Gazipur areas used to collect permissions to establish factory from local municipalities or Gazipur City Corporation.  After the Rana Plaza building collapse in April 2013, it has been made mandatory to seek Rajuk's approval for new factories in an effort to avoid such industrial disasters. Since then, the garment factory owners, especially in Gazipur, Ashulia, Savar and Tongi areas, have been complaining that they are facing troubles in obtaining permissions from Rajuk to setup new units. \"Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association received no written complaint in this regard so far, but verbally some owners have discussed about the issue. Thus, no meeting with Rajuk was held in this regard,\" said Rubana Huq, president of BGMEA. \"Our suggestion is the revised DAP must be approved as soon as possible to avoid confusion.\" On the other hand, Sultan Ahmed, chairman of Rajuk, said if any factory owner submits the documents following the revised strategies of land use, mapping and design, they will get it easily.  \"We will take action if there is such specific complaint with the Rajuk,\" Ahmed told The Daily Star by phone. But, nobody needs to go through the backdoor or paying bribes to any official of the Rajuk, he said adding, \"Anybody can come to the me if he wants. I will solve his problem. I will suggest please come to me I can solve the problems.\" Of the total number of garment and textile factories in Bangladesh, nearly 60 percent are located at Gazipur, Ashulia, Maona, Bhaluka, Savar, Tongi and Mirpur areas.  The factory owners chose the high land of these areas when almost all units had gone under water due to massive flood in 1988.  So, these areas have turned into metropolis as the owners built factories and houses for millions of workers."

      "text": "The boom of export-oriented garment business created jobs for millions of mostly young female workers in Bangladesh, many of who moved from rural areas to urban centres like Dhaka. This created unique and important health and safety issues for these working women--some are typical with women of reproductive age such as maternal and reproductive health whereas some are work-related such as back-pain, machinery injuries, and exposure to particulate matters. Yet, one more issue that has been largely unknown or ignored is their daily exposure to traumatic events. According to a recently published research conducted by a University of Texas Health Science Center Medical and Public Health students and led by this author, garment workers in Bangladesh are found to be highly prone to traumatic events in their daily life. Out of the women they surveyed, three most commonly reported events they experienced in life are natural disasters (71.83 percent), fire/explosions (43.33 percent) and exposure to sudden accidental death (30.15 percent). Contact with such exposures may have short- and long-term impacts on their life, health and wellbeing. The findings may be considered not that unusual for people in general of low socioeconomic status living in a developing country. Bangladesh geographically is prone to natural disasters such as flood where many low-lying regions including some parts of the capital go underwater almost annually and living arrangements of these workers in poor neighbourhoods are not by any means resistant to rain and flood. It is more than likely that these workers are living in makeshift slums or informal-housing facilities which do not follow building codes. Also, the streets of Dhaka and other major cities get clogged with water very quickly and easily after any heavy rainfall. The cities in Bangladesh are overcrowded and its basic infrastructure is very fragile and weak. When their houses get flooded and streets go underwater, garment workers face challenges to live and commute to work. With all the recent and highly visible efforts by western retailers, to get the Bangladesh government and factory owners to improve workplace health and safety, about half of these workers (43.33 percent) are still reporting experiencing a fire/explosion incident. This is unusually high though the survey did not ask if these were encountered at the workplace or their homes or somewhere else, nor asked about its seriousness. If these occurred at home, this finding again highlights the vulnerability of living conditions of these workers in informal and unsafe housing arrangements. In fact, it is surprising that with such high rates of exposure to risk, more workers are not actually sustaining severe burns from such incidents. Witnessing or experiencing sudden violent death (17.89 percent), accidental death (30.15 percent) and serious accidents (14.33 percent) were reported by many of these workers. These findings show the extreme uncertainty associated with a garment worker's life who is so frequently encountering or witnessing these very sad and unfortunate events. Some of these events are likely referring to transportation related accidents that they encounter in their commuting to and from factories or when they visit their family members in rural areas or other parts of the city. The safety of transportation in this country is notoriously bad. Other events may be associated with overall law and order situation. Garments workers, because of their increased use of transportation and interaction with other/outside people, may be encountering more of these adverse events compared to stay at home women. Encountering so many sad and stressful life events create mental stress for garments workers who may develop short- or long-term episodes of depression, anxiety or prolonged period of grief in life. Given all these adversities going on in their personal and social life, the highly demanding and strenuous garments factory work may add to their existing miseries. Providing social protection for these workers is an obligation for the government, factory owners, western retailers and buyers. While the country's economy is heavily dependent on their labour, garments workers are living in deplorable conditions with respect to their physical safety, living arrangements and commuting. The stakeholders can think beyond building and fire safety at the factories and act in a more socially responsible and holistic way to advance the non-work determinants of health and safety of these workers. Raising minimum wage is a very laudable first step. However, instead of only increasing their income, these workers have a lot of other needs as identified and reported here and earlier by many research studies and newspapers reports. Given their age bracket, providing them subsidised and safe rental accommodation close to the factory or in a decent neighbourhood may be more of what they need which can somewhat protect them from many of these unwanted traumatic daily events. Creating specific housing complexes for garments workers in certain areas of Dhaka and its vicinity, factory provided transportation options for these workers, providing discounted grocery vouchers, giving them access to preventative care at factory-run-clinics can be meaningful undertakings by the stakeholders. These may greatly help improve the safety, heath, quality of life and wellbeing of this large economically active workforce. Garments workers of Bangladesh do not need to live in constant fear and anxiety.   A different version of this article was published previously in the International Journal of Social Psychiatry.

That helped him get a grasp of the basics of the language, but his numerous trips and stays in Bangladesh since has made him as fluent as a regular Bangladeshi, as well as fall in love with the local culture. \"This is my first home. I like the people here and the family bonding. People have a good heart. It's not like this in Japan where people are too busy and too self-centred,\" said the veteran coach, who also represents a Japanese crab-exporting company that collects crab from hatcheries in Satkhira. Kitamura, who makes trips to Japan every three months to see his wife, is not the only Japanese coach who has made Bangladesh his home.  Takahiro Taguchi is an adviser of the swimming team who, like Kitamura, has been coming to Bangladesh for coaching stints since the late 1980s. He too can read and speak Bengali fluently, and does not shy away from cracking a joke or two every often.  When asked for an impromptu interview, Taguchi jokingly said, 'Taka lagbe (will give interview for money)', before gladly obliging. \"I came here first in 1987 and I witnessed the flood of 1988 and the cyclone of 1991. I feel at home here, maybe more than in Japan. I like working here,\" said Taguchi. While Japan and JICA have been one of the closest friends of Bangladesh in their development activities, things took a tragic turn after a string of terror attacks on foreigners, culminating in the Holey Artisan Bakery attack in 2016 which took the lives of 24 people, including seven Japanese citizens, who were working here. JICA contemplated stopping their activities in the country but continued with those as the situation improved, thanks to anti-terror drives by the government.  The overall situation of safety and security has also improved much since the time the two coaches first arrived in Dhaka in the late '80s, according to them. \"Earlier people used to steal valuable items. Things are a lot better now. We can move around safely these days and go out on our own at night without any worry,\" Kitamura said. Both coaches felt that there were obvious disadvantages of living in Bangladesh rather than in Japan, but the warmth they get from the people keep them returning to Bangladesh and making it their home.

Due to the sudden erosion many dwelling houses as well as a vast tract of croplands at different villages under Govindsi, Gabsara and Arjuna unions in the upazila were devoured within a few weeks. The worst affected villages are Khanurbari, Kostapara and Bhalkutia under Govindasi union as over 100 dwelling houses and a vast tract of croplands were devoured by the river in the last few days. The erosion affected people have taken shelter on different roads and other's houses. Meanwhile, demanding steps to protect their villages from the dreadful erosion the affected people, living alongside the river, formed a human chain at Kostapara village on Friday. Several hundred riverside people, carrying placards inscribed with different slogans, took part in the rally. Locals alleged that illegal extraction of sand from different places along the river using powerful dredgers is one of the main reasons behind the erosion. Local influential people, having political clout, extracting sand from the river and sell those from over a dozen sand landing stations within eight kilometre areas stretching from Bangabandhu Bridge East Cantonment area to Govindasi Ghat area, they added. Last year, erosion by the Jamuna devoured numerous dwellings and a vast tract of croplands at Arjuna, Bharua, Kuthir Boira, Jagatpura, Tarai and Balarampur villages in Bhuapur upazila and Gorilabari and Beltia village under Gohaliabari union in adjacent Kalihati upazila. Abdul Mazid of Kostapara village said over 100 dwellings and a vast tract of croplands at three villages under Govindasi union were devoured by the river in the last one week. Although the swelling river has been devouring houses, croplands, rural markets, schools, madrasas and other establishments for the last eight years, no step has been taken to protect the areas, he said. Tangail WDB Executive Engineer Sirajul Islam said Geo bags should have been dumped in the affected areas, but they could not do it due to shortage of Geo bags. Away in Netrakona, a newly constructed embankment along the Mohadeo river in Kalmakanda upazila collapsed within five months of its construction, affecting hundreds of families of at least 25 villages under different unions, reports our Mymensingh correspondent. Water Development Board (WDB) built the 285-metre-long embankment recently at a cost of Tk 17 lakh. Netrakona WDB. Sub Assistant Engineer Ibrahim Khalilullah said the construction work of the dyke was conducted on an emergency basis as there was no scope to start a fresh project to rise of water level in the river. \"We are taking preparation to build a 300-metre embankment in Chikontop and Baruakona areas in the coming dry season with an estimated cost of Tk one crore,\" Engineer Khalilullah said, adding that the dam will be built with concrete blocks and guide walls. Contractor Fazlur Rahman, who got the work order, said the embankment collapsed due to strong current and the recent flash flood. Refuting the allegation of substandard work, the contractor said he completed the work as per the work schedule using bamboo, logs and sand bags. Mentionable, about 3,000 families under Rongchhati, Kharnoi and Lengura unions in the upazila have been affected in the recent flash flood."

      "text": "Rajuk is set to turn land originally earmarked for education and environment preservation into commercial and business plots in its 6,227-acre Purbachal New Town project in the city's outskirts. Since it launched the scheme in 1995, between Kaliganj and Rupganj with the Shitalakkhya to the east and the Balu to the west, Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) has so far altered the layout plan five times.   According to documents produced before the High Court to get the fifth layout revision endorsed, Rajuk intends to reduce 269 acres dedicated to 157 educational institutions to 119 acres.   The 150 acres gained from the reduction will be used to create more plots -- residential, commercial, and for more institutional plots that include schools, colleges, universities, hospitals, clinics and clubs. Rajuk insiders said that the existing institutional plots have been split to increase the number of plots and to allot them to more applicants.  \"In this process, some indispensable standard characters and features of an institutional plot have been compromised, capacity was reduced and future higher population density was ignored,\" said an urban planner requesting anonymity. As an instance, it could be seen that instead of institutes having their own playgrounds, as needed, they would now have to share common neighbourhood playgrounds. Rajuk also intends to create 75 more residential plots reducing 49 acres, kept aside for nursery schools, down to 22 acres. The commercial and residential plots are being created to accommodate wealthy, influential, and politically connected people, said sources in Rajuk who wished to be unnamed. Rajuk wants to reduce the space for community centres by five acres and take extra 22 acres from land earmarked as administrative areas. Rajuk is doing this so that it could have an additional 65 acres for commercial plots and 19 acres more for shops, markets, and kitchen markets. As per the proposed fifth revised layout, they have already allotted 110 acres for a 142-storey iconic commercial tower, for which no land was earmarked in the fourth revision. After Rajuk sought endorsement of the fifth revision, the HC, in an order issued in January, observed that the proposed conversion of a huge quantity of land was \"by way of a smart trick\" by \"rearranging\" and \"compromising\" playgrounds of educational institutions.                 Apart from the iconic tower, the HC declined to approve other alterations. Meanwhile, the project cost increased by 135 percent. NOT PLAYING BY THE RULES? Following a public interest litigation in 2013, the HC in March the following year endorsed Rajuk's fourth revision of the plan. It directed Rajuk not to \"efface, subtract, vary or modify the forest, lakes, canals, urban green, parks, playgrounds\", as shown in the fourth revised layout plan, without the court's permission. But there has been widespread allegation that Rajuk in mid-September last year secretly allotted 84 institutional plots taking land from areas earmarked for schools and their playgrounds, violating the 2014 HC judgment. Even though Rajuk usually publishes the list of such plot allotments on its official website, in this case it did not make the list public even after six months. When asked, Project Director Ujwal Mallick said he did not know anything about altering the project layout plans or creation of new plots. He directed the correspondent towards Sheikh Shahinul Islam, Rajuk director for estate and land. Asked over the phone about the allotment of 84 plots, Shahinul on March 4 asked this correspondent to meet him face-to-face. When the correspondent met him that very day, he said, \"I cannot talk about this issue, the Rajuk chairman can. I just wanted to be acquainted to you.\" When The Daily Star correspondent spoke to Rajuk Chairman Md Abdur Rahman on March 10, he said, \"I can't say why the layout had to be revised five times. \"According to the government's education curriculum, we have to reduce the number of nursery schools.\" About the rationale for reducing educational plots and playgrounds and increasing commercial land, the chairman said, \"I need to know in details to respond.\" He said the fourth revised layout plan had 263 institutional plots, of which they had allotted 197, including the latest 84, with the remaining yet to be allotted. Asked why they did not make public the list of allotment of 84 institutional plots, he said he had just heard from this correspondent that it was not published. When asked for the list, he said, \"I have to think about it.\" Later in the day, the chairman said the list had been uploaded on Rajuk's official website. This correspondent, however, could not find it even yesterday and he informed the chairman of the matter. Abdur Rahman had earlier told The Daily Star that Rajuk would not implement the fifth revision of the layout but yesterday he said Rajuk would appeal to the HC in a day or two to have the revision endorsed. The Rajuk chairman said the Rajuk chief architect, who went into retirement around a year ago, had agreed to all the revisions and creation of new plots. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela), said Rajuk had argued before the court that they had allotted all available plots and the court should endorse the fourth revised layout plan. She said if they had adhered to the fourth revised plan in allotting the 84 controversial plots, then why do they want a fifth amendment? Rizwana also wondered why the list of allotment was not made public. To understand the extent of environmental damage caused in the process of executing the scheme, one must note that Rajuk had to pay more compensation for trees and forests than what it had to pay for land acquisition, said Rizwana. Bela in 2015 filed an appeal opposing the 2014 HC judgment, which endorsed the fourth revision of the layout. Bela argued that implementation of the fourth revision would imply felling of 11 lakh trees. The Appellate Division in a February 2017 order observed that \"Rajuk had been implementing Purbachal scheme by felling trees and filling up canals and this sort of work should not be allowed to continue\".  The court directed Rajuk to obtain environmental clearance to implement the scheme. The court also observed that rampant felling of trees and indiscriminate filling up of various water bodies would certainly threaten the ecosystem and biodiversity of the project areas. Khondaker M Ansar Hossain, an urban planner who worked as a technical expert on Dhaka city's Detailed Area Plan, said the entire area where Purbachal was being developed was originally comprised of extensive flood flow zones, rural homesteads, arable land, and forests. Dhaka's master plan forbids execution of this scheme because only rural homesteads could be there, he said. Still, the Purbachal scheme went ahead showing it as \"overlay\", meaning an entity already existing, but actually execution of the scheme took place after the Detailed Area Plan was made. Rajuk launched the scheme branding it as a model, self-contained, smart and largest planned township in the country."

      "text": "Prolonged flood in the char lands of Gaibandha district has completely damaged aman seedlings causing local farmers to worry about their crops. However, with advice from agriculture officers, farmers found a solution in the floating seedbed technology. This year the Brahmaputra river rose 150 centimetres above danger mark, the highest in two decades, and inundated croplands including aman seedbeds. According to district agriculture extension office, aman seedlings on 2,881 hectares of land in Gaibandha went under five to seven feet of standing water, damaging all prospect of transplanting the seeds in the next phase of aman cultivation. Instead of waiting for the water to subside for preparing regular seedbeds on land, the agriculture department advised farmers to prepare floating aman seedbeds on the floodwater. This way the saplings will be ready for transplantation in time within the aman cultivation season and also not get damaged if another flood occurs.  While visiting the flood ravaged unions of Sundarganj upazila, farmers were seen sowing aman seeds on floating beds made from heaped up water hyacinths and mud. \"I have prepared two floating beds as suggested by our upazila agriculture officer and sowed seed of BRRI- 51 aman variety. The seedlings can later be transplanted to cover four and half bighas of land,\" said Raju Mia, a farmer of Ramjibon union in Sundarganj upazila. BRRI- 51 aman, a flood tolerant variety suitable for flood prone areas, specially char lands along river basins, survives for two weeks under water, said SM Sarower Hossain, sub-assistant agriculture officer of Ramjibon union. Another farmer Rafiqul Islam of Bochagari village in Kapasia union, said \"My aman seedbed on five decimals of land, which could have been transplanted on five bighas of land, got damaged in the recent flood. The land would remain fallow if I do not arrange aman seedlings in time\". When asked why Rafiqul did not prepare floating seedbeds, he said, \"I don't know how to do so but I will talk to the agriculture department and try to start it soon.\" Syed Reza-e-Mahmud, Upazila Agriculture Officer (UAO) of Sundarganj said at least 32 floating seedbeds have already been prepared in different areas of Sundarganj Upazila, some people have leased water bodies to prepare floating seedbeds to sell saplings commercially. Deputy Director S M Ferdous of the Agriculture Extension Directorate, Gaibandha, said, \"As per instruction of the agriculture ministry, we have selected 56 farmers of seven upazilas of the district, trained them, and gave each of them an incentive grant of Taka 1165 to prepare floating seedbeds.\" This will encourage other farmers to follow suit, he hoped."

      "text": "The Supreme Court yesterday upheld its earlier verdict that had directed the authorities concerned to restore the wetland in Savar where Modhumoti Model Town, a housing project, has been developed. A seven-member SC bench, headed by Chief Justice Syed Mahmud Hossain, dismissed the five petitions seeking a review of its earlier verdict. The apex court verdict has brought to an end the legal battle that had dragged on for around 15 years. Now the project authorities have to remove all the earth from the area for keeping it as a free-flood flow zone, say legal experts. On July 11, 2013, the SC released the full text of its 159-page verdict directing the project owner, Metro Makers and Developer Limited, to restore within six months the wetland in Savar's Bilamalia and Bailarpur moujas. In September 2013, the private firm and buyers of plots in the project lodged five petitions with the SC, seeking a review of its judgment. Earlier, the SC in a verdict on August 7, 2012, upheld a High Court judgment that had declared illegal the Modhumoti Model Town near Aminbazar.  The apex court directed the authorities concerned to keep the area as a free-flood flow zone. Metro Makers and Developer Limited developed the housing project, filling up 550 acres of wetland identified as floodplain in the 1997 Dhaka City Master Plan. The HC on July 27, 2005, declared the project unauthorised, illegal and against public interest. It also said that the interest of the buyers must be protected. In August 2004, Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela) filed a writ petition with the HC as public interest litigation, challenging the legality of the project. It said the project was developed violating the Environment Conservation Act, Town Improvement Act and Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) rules. In its petition, Bela mentioned that if the project continued, the character of the area would be destroyed and the environment would be polluted. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bela, told this newspaper that following the SC order, the Metro Makers and Developer Limited must remove all the earth from the project area and restore the wetland within six months."

      "text": "Around 50,000 people of 20 villages in Sadar and Jaldhaka upazilas of the district have been suffering for around three years as construction of a bridge over Burikhora river on important Ramnagar-Mirganj Road has not been completed. Work on the bridge is stopped as the construction firm withdrew the workers around three months ago. Sadar Upazila Engineer of Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) Saiful Islam said the old bridge was washed away in the flood of 2015, so they floated a tender to build a new 190-foot-long and 20-foot-wide concrete bridge at a cost of Tk 2.41 crore. Local firm Messrs Mofakkharul Islam got work order in November, 2016, to complete it within two years. Visiting the site on January 22, this correspondent found that girders, wing walls and three pairs of pillars have been completed, but the railings on both sides of the bridge are still incomplete. No labourers or masons were present at the site, he added. The upazila engineer said only 70 percent of the work has been completed so far. The contractor did not build the approach roads but just dumped some sand on the two ends of the bridge, he added. Locals said they made a bamboo bridge on one side so that bikes and rickshaw vans can cross, but it is risky and people sometimes fall from it and get hurt. Tafser Ali of the area said a biker, Laxmikanta Roy, 50, was injured when he slipped from the risky makeshift bridge and fell on the dried river bed last week. He is undergoing treatment at Rangpur Medical College Hospital, Tafser added. Giriza Prosonna Roy, 60, a resident and an ex-schoolteacher, said the contractor took his workers to work at another site, leaving the bridge incomplete.  \"We are now compelled to bring groceries on trucks, travelling an additional 30 km,\" said Abdus Sattar, 45, a grocer of nearby Bahalipara market. Wahidul Islam, 55, headmaster of Ramnagar High School, said there are five schools on both sides of the river and many students cannot attend classes in the rainy season for want of a bridge. Contractor Mofakhkharul Islam Mamun refuted the allegatiosn, alleging that some people stopped the construction, claiming that the land belongs to them.  \"Initially, locals donated land to build the bridge and approach roads but now they are demanding compensation, which we cannot give as the government has not allocated any money. We want to solve the problems with the help of elected public representatives,\" said Md Belal Hossain, executive engineer of district LGED."

      "text": "If it were before 1983, people would be seen fishing at the exact same spot where children now play football, on Teesta's sandy floor lying arid and barren. The river is no longer blessed with water, except for a few months of the year.  Out of the 115km course of the river flowing inside Bangladesh, more than 100km (from Teesta Barrage to the river's confluence in Kurigram) has completely dried up this dry season. There are small pools of water here and there, and the rest is mere chars. Habibur Rahman, 58, a farmer of Char Hokunda in Lalmonirhat sadar upazila, said, \"Thousands of people living by the Teesta are entirely dependent on its water. Our suffering has known no bounds after the river dried up. \"Due to lack of water, we have to set up water pumps on the river bed to irrigate farms and grow crops like potato, ground nut, jute, maize and vegetables,\" he said. Since the beginning of the dry season (March to May), there has been little water in the downstream of Teesta Barrage built in Dowani area of Lalmonirhat's Hatibandha upazila. \"We are getting 1,500-2,000 cusecs (cubic feet per second) of water at the Teesta barrage point for the last two months, which is the highest in 12 years. But it is barely enough,\" said Abdullah Al-Mamun, executive engineer of Water Development Board (WDB) in Nilphamari. He said the lowest flow was recorded there last year, at 165 cusecs. \"As all of 44 gates of the barrage are kept closed for supplying irrigation water, the downstream isn't getting any water at all, causing it to dry up completely,\" Mamun said. The water flow at the barrage point is inadequate even for the upstream of the barrage. \"We need at least 3,500 cusecs in the barrage area during this period,\" he said. WDB Sub-divisional Engineer in Lalmonirhat Bazle Karim said the Teesta has turned into a desert. \"Mile after mile you would see only chars throughout the downstream. \"There is water here and there, which hardly goes knee-deep. It would be of no use for irrigation,\" he said. \"Because of the unavailability of water, only 30 percent of the char lands used for farming get irrigation, that too through water pumps. The remaining 70 percent, with around 15,000 hectares of land, remains barren.\" Agriculture and fishing have been seriously hurt due to lack of water. Sudhir Cahndra Das, 62, of Daspara area in Lalmonirhat sadar upazila, said once people used to fish, irrigate and bathe in Teesta railway bridge area, 76km downstream of the barrage. \"Now we can't make a living by fishing in the river for 7-8 months of the year.\" The river gets fairly enough water only for a few months from July to October. The rest of the year, it is dry. Things changed after 1983 when India built Gajoldoba barrage in the Teesta, 70km upstream of Bangladesh's own in Dowani area. Before that, the average flow used to be 4,000-4,500 cusecs throughout the river, from Nilphamari border to its meeting with the Brahmaputra in Kurigram. As the Teesta barrage in Dowani, the country's second largest irrigation project, holds up the dry season flow for irrigation, all 102km of the downstream gets no water at all. As a result, only 13km of the upstream has water, albeit not enough, for irrigation. Bidhubhushon Roy, deputy director of Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), Lalmonirhat, said agriculture is badly affected in the river basin. \"The majority of the char land and floodplains remains barren due to a shortage of underground water.\" Engineer Karim said as there is no water in the Teesta, the underground aquifers cannot replenish and do not have enough reserve. \"The farmers have to go down 40-80 meters to reach water. If the river had water, the underground water table would be only 5-6 meters away.\" With no water in the river and underground aquifers going further down, the farmers have to pay additional cost for irrigation, making farming expensive. DAE official Bidhubhushon Roy said, \"Farmers need to pay Tk 2,000 to water one bigha of land using the water pump, whereas it would take only Tk 250 if the river had water.\" Shafiqul Islam, president of Nodi Bachao Andolon in Lalmonirhat, said, \"Thousands of people, including boatmen and fishermen, depend on the river for livelihoods. They are left without a living for seven to eight months of the year.\" WDB official Karim said there is no way the Teesta would get water in the dry season if there is no water sharing deal with India."

      "text": "The first consignment of onion will arrive from Egypt on Tuesday, according to a commerce ministry official.   Senior Information Officer of the ministry Abdul Latif Bakshi confirmed The Daily Star today that S Alam group is importing huge quantities of onions and the first batch will arrive through cargo planes on Tuesday.   Price of onion has continued to rise since September after India restricted its onion export after yield of the bulb-type vegetable was heavily damaged due to flood in a number of states of the neighbouring country. Each kilogramme of onion was sold for Tk 240-260 in the capital yesterday and the prices kept rising by the hour. Earlier this month, each kg of locally grown onion was sold for Tk 100-120 in the kitchen markets in the capital. But the price jumped to Tk 160 on Tuesday morning and then kept rising. The prices rose by Tk 30 to 40 every day since Wednesday. To boost supplies, the government and private companies are using cargo planes to import the essential spice within the shortest possible time. According to the National Board of Revenue (NBR), 50,191 tonnes of onion worth Tk 241.92 crore were imported from Myanmar, Egypt, China, Thailand, India, United Arab Emirate (UAE), Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Turkish and Australia in the last 45 days. A total of 926 consignments were imported by 186 importers though the seven land and sea ports. During the same period, another 15.73 tonnes of onion worth US$ 25,100 (Tk 21 lakh approximately) were imported by cargo planes mainly from Thailand, Egypt and UAE in 81 consignments, NBR data revealed. S Alam Group will import about 55 tonnes of onion out of 69 tonnes to be brought to the country by a total of 19 traders, as per data from the Plant Quarantine Center of Chattogram Seaport.  "

      "text": "At the end of the Cold War, political scientist Francis Fukuyama wrote a celebrated essay called \"The End of History?\" Communism's collapse, he argued, would clear the last obstacle separating the entire world from its destiny of liberal democracy and market economies. Many people agreed. Today, as we face a retreat from the rules-based, liberal global order, with autocratic rulers and demagogues leading countries that contain well over half the world's population, Fukuyama's idea seems quaint and naive. But it reinforced the neoliberal economic doctrine that has prevailed for the last 40 years. The credibility of neoliberalism's faith in unfettered markets as the surest road to shared prosperity is on life-support these days. And well it should be. The simultaneous waning of confidence in neoliberalism and in democracy is no coincidence or mere correlation. Neoliberalism has undermined democracy for 40 years. The form of globalisation prescribed by neoliberalism left individuals and entire societies unable to control an important part of their own destiny, as Dani Rodrik of Harvard University has explained so clearly, and as I argue in my recent books \"Globalisation and Its Discontents Revisited\" and \"People, Power, and Profits\". The effects of capital-market liberalisation were particularly odious: If a leading presidential candidate in an emerging market lost favour with Wall Street, the banks would pull their money out of the country. Voters then faced a stark choice: Give in to Wall Street or face a severe financial crisis. It was as if Wall Street had more political power than the country's citizens. Even in rich countries, ordinary citizens were told, \"You can't pursue the policies you want\"--whether adequate social protection, decent wages, progressive taxation, or a well-regulated financial system--\"because the country will lose competitiveness, jobs will disappear, and you will suffer.\" In rich and poor countries alike, elites promised that neoliberal policies would lead to faster economic growth, and that the benefits would trickle down so that everyone, including the poorest, would be better off. To get there, though, workers would have to accept lower wages, and all citizens would have to accept cutbacks in important government programmes. The elites claimed that their promises were based on scientific economic models and \"evidence-based research\". Well, after 40 years, the numbers are in: growth has slowed, and the fruits of that growth went overwhelmingly to a very few at the top. As wages stagnated and the stock market soared, income and wealth flowed up, rather than trickling down. How can wage restraint--to attain or maintain competitiveness--and reduced government programmes possibly add up to higher standards of living? Ordinary citizens felt like they had been sold a bill of goods. They were right to feel conned. We are now experiencing the political consequences of this grand deception: distrust of the elites, of the economic \"science\" on which neoliberalism was based, and of the money-corrupted political system that made it all possible. The reality is that, despite its name, the era of neoliberalism was far from liberal. It imposed an intellectual orthodoxy whose guardians were utterly intolerant of dissent. Economists with heterodox views were treated as heretics to be shunned, or at best shunted off to a few isolated institutions. Neoliberalism bore little resemblance to the \"open society\" that Karl Popper had advocated. As George Soros has emphasised, Popper recognised that our society is a complex, ever-evolving system in which the more we learn, the more our knowledge changes the behaviour of the system. Nowhere was this intolerance greater than in macroeconomics, where the prevailing models ruled out the possibility of a crisis like the one we experienced in 2008. When the impossible happened, it was treated as if it were a 500-year flood--a freak occurrence that no model could have predicted. Even today, advocates of these theories refuse to accept that their belief in self-regulating markets and their dismissal of externalities as either non-existent or unimportant led to the deregulation that was pivotal in fuelling the crisis. The theory continues to survive, with Ptolemaic attempts to make it fit the facts, which attests to the reality that bad ideas, once established, often have a slow death. If the 2008 financial crisis failed to make us realise that unfettered markets don't work, the climate crisis certainly should: neoliberalism will literally bring an end to our civilisation. But it is also clear that demagogues who would have us turn our back on science and tolerance will only make matters worse. The only way forward, the only way to save our planet and our civilisation, is a rebirth of history. We must revitalise the Enlightenment and recommit to honouring its values of freedom, respect for knowledge, and democracy.

      "text": "Eid holidaymakers faced long delay on their way home yesterday due to disruption of ferry services, long tailbacks on highways and late departure of some trains. Heavy rain throughout the day added to their woes. People heading for south-western districts such as Khulna, Jessore and Barisal were among the worst victims, as they had to wait for hours, first at bus terminals and then at ferry terminals. Ferry services were disrupted because of strong current in the Padma river. Those bound for north-eastern regions were stuck for hours in tailbacks on Dhaka-Bogura, Dhaka-Rajshahi and Dhaka-Mymensingh highways. And as on the previous day, most intercity trains heading for north-western districts ran one to three hours behind schedule. \"The overall situation is very bad,\" said Osman Ali, general secretary of Bangladesh Road Transport Workers Federation. Although the three-day public holiday for Eid will begin Sunday, a large number of government and non-government employees left Dhaka yesterday. Many of them took leave for Wednesday (August 14), the only working day next week, to make their vacation longer. FERRY TERMINALS  Ferry services at Shimulia-Kathalbari saw a huge pressure of vehicles yesterday as water vessel operation resumed after 17 hours of suspension due to rough wave and strong current in the Padma. More than 300 vehicles were waiting at Shimulia at 7:00pm, said Abdul Alim, manager (commerce) of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) at Shimulia terminal. Only four ferries were in operation in the morning due to bad weather. The authorities were able to operate all the 16 ferries only after 12:00noon, when weather became normal. Ferries are taking 20 minutes more than in normal time to cross the river due to strong current, said Alim. Rafiqul Islam, a private service holder, said his bus of Tungipara Express was supposed to start from Gulistan at 12:00noon but started at 2:30pm, because of huge jam at Shimulia-Kathalbari. The disruption at Shimulia-Kathalbari eventually affected the ferry services at Paturia-Dauladia terminals. At 3:00pm, some 300 light vehicles, 100 buses and 400 trucks were waiting at Paturia end, although the situation improved a little in the evening, said Azamal Hossain, deputy general manager of BIWTC at Aricha office. He said they were operating 17 ferries and that three more would join their fleet soon. Several bus operators at Gabtoli terminal said they were facing problems to maintain schedule as buses were taking more time to return to Dhaka because of the gridlock at ferry terminals. Rifat Hossain, a private university student, said, \"I came to the terminal at 9:00am defying rain, but my bus has not arrived yet [at 11:00am]. I don't know how much longer I will have to wait.\" JAM ON HIGHWAYS People heading for northern districts faced traffic jam after crossing the Bangabandhu bridge for hours in the morning due to the sorry state of the road at different points and poor condition of Nolka bridge. Vehicles have to cross the bridge very slowly due to its poor condition, causing traffic jam from Bangabandhu bridge west zone to Nolka point, said Sayed Shahid Alam, officer-in-charge of Bangabandhu bridge west zone police station. Besides, repair work was underway on Dhaka (Hatikumrul)-Bogura and Dhaka (Hatikumrul)-Bonpara highways for the last day before Eid, causing traffic congestion. Vehicles heading for 22 districts of north, west and south have to cross Hatikumrul point, said Akteruzzaman, officer-in-charge of Hatikumrul highway police station. People also faced problem on the 13km stretch from Tongi Bridge to Joydevpur Chowrasta on Dhaka-Mymensingh Highway because of construction work of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). Under this project, the government would construct a 20.5km dedicated bus lane from Dhaka to Gazipur. But in the absence of a proper drainage system, parts of the four-lane highway were submerged after rain, disrupting traffic movement, said Osman Ali, general secretary of Bangladesh Road Transport Workers Federation. The Gazipur City Corporation Mayor had assured of deploying 500 volunteers to control the situation, but that gave little relief due to rain, he added. CROWD AT KAMALAPUR Commuters travelling on trains to northern and north-western regions continued to suffer as all but one intercity trains were late by one to three hours. According to the Train Tracking Monitoring System, Chilahati-bound Nilsagar Express, Rajshahi-bound Silkcity, Rangpur-bound Rangpur Express, Panchagarh-bound Ekata Express, Rajshahi-bound Dhumketu Express and Silkcity Express and Khulna-bound Sundarban Express were late by about two hours to nearly three and a half hours. Chapainawabganj-bound Banolata Express was 20 minutes late to depart Kamalapur. Operations of trains on other routes were on time. Asked about the delay, Station Manager Aminul Hoque told reporters that holidaymakers usually took a long time to embark and disembark trains, resulting in such delays. Meanwhile, train service through Santaher-Lalmonirhat route that connects Dhaka and northern districts resumed yesterday, 22 days after it was suspended due to flood. WATERWAYS  Pressure of passengers at the country's largest launch terminal at Sadarghat increased in the evening. \"Some 80 launches are being operated during normal time. Around 25 more launches will run tonight [Thursday],\" said Alamgir Kabir, joint director of BIWTA. Usually, 7,080 launches ply 40 routes, mostly to the country's southern region from Dhaka's Sadarghat. Some 130 more will join the fleet to carry 8-10 lakh people, who travel by waterways during Eid vacation, according to transport operators. Meanwhile, the BIWTA said it would not allow motorcycles on any passenger-carrying vessels from Sadarghat terminal during Eid rush.

Who cares about the pain of those removed working under the soil in this city of always Spring? How many wails make this earth tremble?   Let me tell my tale, a tale of exiles from the land of flames- I am an exile lost in the hot womb of soil. Solitude holds me, makes my heart weep and drills a hole; every moment accumulates eternities.   Everyday, when dusk ceases, my existence is obscured in the darkness of the deep. I can hardly remember that I belong to this earth. Once had chores, had Springs, had a childhood on the wings of dreams, an urge to love and be loved by someone, a home of happiness, blessings from my mother. Now, exiled, I am under the earth of this city trapped by many layers of dust, nourished by the smell of grief in my breath. Loveless moments turn me silent, pain clothes this fatigue-torn body, but in the hope of light beyond darkness this exiled heart still floats from the bottomless tunnel.

Of the four officials approved for the trip by the water resources ministry, one is a senior engineer who would retire in December. Another engineer has about five months before he too would retire, official documents reveal. The officials going on the trip are: Additional Director General AKM Shamsul Karim, Additional Chief Engineer Mir Mosharrof Hossain and Superintendent Engineer Md Ruhul Amin of Bangladesh Water Development Board (WDB). They will be accompanied by Mahmudul Islam, additional secretary of the water resources ministry. The trip is part of a Tk195-crore project being implemented by Dockyard and Engineering Works Limited, an enterprise of Bangladesh Navy. The government officials have no direct role, except coordinating, in the project implementation, said water development board officials, requesting anonymity. Only three days before their scheduled trip, the officials couldn't even tell this correspondent what advanced knowledge they were hoping to gain and from which institutions in the US and the UK. The BWDB has a training institute in Munshiganj for its engineers. It also jointly runs Kaptai Training Institute with the Power Development Board.   Officials of the board said the expensive foreign trip was a farce and complete waste of public money. Asked what they are going to learn in the USA and the UK, Superintendent Engineer Ruhul Amin said, \"We will learn about Chicago harbour management, and see management of beaches, rivers, and coasts in the US and the UK.\" Asked which institution they would visit, he said, \"Dockyard and Engineering Works Limited will most likely hire an event management firm to conduct the study tour. There is a tentative programme, but I don't know much about it.\" He added that the event management firm will prepare the itinerary and estimate the expenses. He declined to disclose the name of the event management firm. The proposed expense is Tk 10 lakh per person, but that may change later, he said.   Asked how the people of this country would benefit from the training of Shamsul Karim, who is going to retire in December, Ruhul Amin said, \"The water resources ministry would be in a better position to respond to the question.\"   He added that he had made the proposal for the tour by the officials and then the water development board endorsed it. The additional secretary was included by the ministry. To a similar question asked over phone, Mir Mosharrof Hossain, additional chief engineer who retires in May, said, \"What will you do with this information?\" and hung up when pressed further. As to why the ministry approved the trip of soon-to-retire engineers,Mahmudul Islam, additional secretary to the water resources ministry, said, \"Normally, we don't intervene in what the board recommends.\" As to why the ministry endorsed the foreign tour of an engineer, who is retiring in a month, he said, \"I don't know.\"     Asked why he, being an administration official, is going on the trip, he said, \"It will help develop the knowledge base of the society.\" According to official records, Mahmudul Islam went on at least two foreign tours in October: one in Hungary and another in Japan.   Abdul Matin, professor of water resources engineering at Buet, said, \"I was not aware that senior engineers and non-engineers like them go abroad to get knowledge on river bank protection, dredging, canal digging, and embankment restoration.  \"We at Buet offer professional training and courses on water engineering,\" he said, \"Our department has given professional training to water board and LGED engineers with World Bank and ADB support.\" The foreign visit was proposed under Bakkhali River Flood Control, Drainage, Irrigation and Dredging project. The three-and-a-half-year project is scheduled to be completed in June next year and has made about 40 percent physical progress. Officials familiar with the proceedings said the trip was going to cost almost half a crore taka. According to a water resources ministry order issued on November 17, the officers would be deemed on duty while on the trip and they would be able to draw the regular pays and allowances. It is unlikely that the country would benefit from such an expensive trip by an admin cadre officer to learn technical matters, said a senior engineer of Water Development Board, adding that the officer in question might even get transferred to some other ministry in future. According to records, WDB engineers have built 16,261km of embankments, including 5,757km in coastal region, dredged 1,388km of rivers, and had done many other water development work.       Some of the WDB engineers are eminent experts with global recognition, said officials. The water resources ministry on November 24 sanctioned a nine-day \"experience sharing\" tour by eight officials in Australia and Malaysia to learn river bank protection, dredging and construction of earthen embankment under a Tk-510 crore project in Sirajganj. Among the officials chosen for the tour are a WDB chief engineer who would in December."

      "text": "Optimism to turn the tide in his favour had preoccupied the mind of Bimal Krishna Biswas as 2018 drew to a close. The 62-year-old farmer dreamt of renovating his house with brick walls in 2019 with the sales of paddy and the income from fish farm he and his neighbours had in partnership in their locality. One year has passed by but his hope of a better home, increased wealth and improved living standard remains a distant dream. \"This is totally a year of losses for me. How could I make profit unless the prices of paddy go up?\" said Biswas, a farmer from Tungipara in the southwestern district of Gopalganj, over phone yesterday. He cultivated paddy and other crops on five acres of land, including two acres he took as a lease. The elderly farmer and his neighbours live in an area where crop fields remained submerged for seven months a year and they get only five months to grow paddy during the dry season. The paddy grown during the Boro season is the prime crop on which Biswas and tens of thousands of farmers in the country rely for their living. The season is expected to produce 52 percent of the total 3.78 crore tonnes of rice this calendar year, up 4 percent year-on-year, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and the Department of Agricultural Extension. This year, they were deprived of profit for higher domestic production that outpaced demand, causing the price to fall. The average national wholesale prices of rice fell between 13 percent and 21 percent from the previous year. Wholesale prices of coarse rice fell 21 percent to Tk 2,753 per quintal, according to the Department of Agricultural Marketing, which compiled price data until October. And the prices of the cereal were 24 percent lower than the government's procurement rates of Tk 36 per kg during this year's Boro and Aman seasons. Farmers said the prices of paddy had edged up slightly at the beginning of harvest of the second biggest crop, aman, but the spike was short-lived. The price has remained low irrespective of grain quality as the speed of the government's purchase is slow. In order to ensure profits for farmers, the government has declared to buy 6 lakh tonnes of paddy directly from producers during the current aman harvest season. But the food office began purchasing paddy on November 20 and has managed to buy 38,000 tonnes until Dec 23. Biswas had spent as high as Tk 700 for hiring a farmworker to harvest paddy. But after the harvest, they found the prices of paddy were about Tk 500 a maund. \"This is really frustrating. We had good prices last year. None of us have peace of mind this year,\" said Biswas, who also suffered losses as tidal surge for cyclone Bulbul destroyed fish farm. The farmers who grew jute benefited, he said. Farmers grow more than 200 crops, including four cereals, 153 vegetables and 34 types of spices, oilseeds, pulses and cash crops such as jute and sugarcane. Including fruits, the total number of crops and fruits grown would be roughly 350, according to the Agriculture Information Service. \"Potatoes brought me profit to some extent by the end of 2019,\" said Masud Rana, a farmer from northwestern district of Kurigram. The 42-year-old farmer cultivates wheat, mustard, potato and vegetable on his three-acre farmland and says flood-affected seedlings of paddy and early plantation in his area, raising the cost of production. \"Rice is our main crop and our wellbeing depends on it,\" Rana said. Rice is grown on more than 70 percent of the total cropped area of 1.54 crore hectares and 77 percent of marginal and small farmers depend on rice for food security and livelihoods, according to the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey 2015, funded by the USAID. Liakat Ali, a farmer from northern district Sherpur, said the farmers who depend highly on paddy suffered losses owing to falling prices of the grain. \"But I am better off as I grew potato, beans, onions and bottle gourd and I am getting higher prices from these vegetables,\" he said. All the three farmers said those who have grown onions, encouraged by skyrocketing prices of the key cooking ingredient this winter, have had margins. Yet, the number of onion growers is insignificant compared to rice producers. Fifty-one percent farmers grow only rice and 20 percent of growers produce rice along with other crops, said Akhter Ahmed, country representative of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). \"It appears that falling price of Boro paddy hampers farmers' wellbeing. But, there had been major setback except for the price of Boro paddy. Overall, the outgoing year has not been too bad or too good,\" he said. Ahmed said ensuring fair prices is vital. \"Reduction in prices of diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser is a positive step towards reducing the production cost of farmers.\" The government slashed the prices of the key fertiliser by 36 percent to Tk 16 each kilogram early December to give a boost to farming. \"The price cut raises hopes that we will make profit in the coming season,\" said Sanjay Kumar, a small farmer from Gabtoli of northwest district Bogura. He cultivated vegetables and rainfall destroyed his tomato field twice. With crop producers looking at their balance sheet for 2019, dairy farmers also did the same. The demand for locally produced milk was affected because of safety concerns following findings by the Bangladesh Food Safety Authority and a team of Dhaka University researchers on the presence of harmful substances in samples of pasteurised and raw milk. \"Our situation has not improved this year. Instead, it deteriorated,\" said Mohammad Shah Emran, general secretary of the Bangladesh Dairy Farmers Association. \"The demand for locally produced milk suffered. We, the farmers, did not get fair prices because of soaring imports of meat and power milk.\" On the other hand, the prices of feed rose and dairy farmers have to pay electricity bills at commercial rates even though the sector is part of agriculture, which enjoys lower tariff than other sectors, he said. \"Rice growers suffered in 2019 but consumers did not suffer as prices of the staple remained almost stable,\" said Quazi Shahabuddin, a former director general of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies.  Consumers can complain about higher onion prices, which have provided profits to farmers recently, he said. In 2020, the government should pay attention to ensure balance in the prices of essential commodities and farm produce to ensure a win-win situation for both consumers and farmers, Shahabuddin said. IFPRI Country Chief Ahmed said the thrust should be on rapid mechanisation, especially for harvesting in order to reduce the cost of production resulting from higher labour cost. The government will roll out a scheme to provide subsidies to farmers to buy agri-machinery, said Md Shahjahan Kabir, director general of the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute. \"We hope that farmers will make profit next year on the back of the cut in prices of DAP and the plan for faster mechanisation,\" he said. Biswas is still hoping for the paddy prices to recover so that he can sell more than 500 maunds of the staple now in his storage. The crop damage in some areas of southwest and south owing to cyclone Bulbul could prompt the prices to go up. \"I am waiting for the prices to increase,\" said the grower, who has also cultivated onion.

      "text": "Bangladesh's banking sector faces a number of major challenges including rising nonperforming loans, credit concentrations, poor culture of professionalism, the rise of family oligarchy, lack of corporate culture, capital market debility, and parallel banking by the government through deficit financing instruments. Many of the challenges, by now, have turned into threats to the country's financial architecture mainly due to two reasons: the central bank's weak leadership and the finance ministry's institutional trespassing on banking affairs. A lack of knowledge on why policies should be consistent has led to a culture of financial indiscipline.  By definition, the central bank is the single most powerful custodian of the banking sector. This is also what the law states. In 1972, Bangabandhu formulated the Bangladesh Bank Order which delineates the powers and responsibilities of the central bank. Of course, it is linked to the finance ministry but the central bank isn't supposed to be a subsidiary office of the ministry. It is supposed to be the custodian of the nation's currency supply and is responsible for preserving the right value of the currency as per the 1972 Order. The 2003 amendments made it clear that the ministry can't interfere in the internal policy decisions of the central bank. But what we have seen is that finance ministers often speak as if they are a head of a monetary body. What we have also seen is that BB seeks endorsements from the ministry even for day-to-day affairs. This is a bad signal for professional bankers but a good signal for defaulters. It is a virtual merger of the central bank with the secretariat under the office of the banking division.  Unfortunately, most of our institutions carry the vestiges of colonial legacy. Bureaucracy, being its best example, warrants reform. And so does our central bank. Why? The British at some point realised that their central bank should be bestowed with greater powers and discretion. The Bank of England's governor enjoys a high level of authority in monetary and financial decisions. He was even made the chair of the financial stability board of Great Britain. If we look further to the west, the Fed chair is deemed as the second most powerful person after the president in America. The world has changed but we haven't. It's as if the ministry expects a completely pliant leadership at the central bank so that the monetary authority can't question any weakness in fiscal capacity, fiscal deficit, and fiscal desperation. This tug-of-war has always been there since the birth of the central bank. But most countries have solved this conflict in two ways: (i) by clearly separating the powers and responsibilities of these two institutions, and (ii) by empowering the central bank to make it a nonpartisan custodian of the economy. While the ministry gets its oxygen from political mandates, the central bank can't. Hence, it looks to the constitution for the powers bestowed upon it to guard the greater interests of the economy in a dispassionate, scholarly, honest, and nonpolitical manner. Timely reform of the BB Order and strong leadership at the central bank are the need of the hour to tackle the threats (calling them \"challenges\" is an understatement) looming in the banking sector. And Bangladesh has to do this, because, unlike other emerging countries, the banking sector is the main vehicle of development since the capital market has already been partly vandalised. The government has to understand that policy inconsistency will ruin the market in the long run. It has to realise that the central bank should be the main controller of the interest rate. All other interest rates, even some offered on government instruments, must follow the market or the long-term bond rates assigned by the central bank. Otherwise, attempts to develop either the bond market or secondary market will be thwarted. Short-term management of fiscal deficit shouldn't empower the ministry to assign out-of-market interest rates to fiscal tools. That is how fiscal desperation ruins the effectiveness of monetary policy. We shouldn't forget what 16th-century economist Sir Thomas Gresham observed: \"Good and bad coins cannot circulate together.\" The bad will drive the good away. In the same way, the \"bad\" interest rates (which are of course \"good\" for the super-rich) on National Savings Certificates (NSCs) are leading to deposit rates offered by the \"poor\" banks becoming dysfunctional. The government wants the lending rates to be brought down to single digits. How can it happen when the government itself is offering double-digit rates on its NSCs? Lending rates must sit on the deposit rates and the spread needed for bankers' bread and butter. Sanchayapatra is doomed to fail no matter how much it grows. The flood of inflows from Sanchayapatra is temporarily hiding the fiscal incapacity of the ministry, but it is leading to a burden on one of the most expensive ways of deficit financing in the world. The interest liability is rising--a threat that will wipe off a big segment of the budget which could otherwise be spent on development. Inconsistent policies and fiscal trespassing are the main hindrances to interest rate rationalisation. The Reserve Bank of India made a policy so that government-offered interest rates are always linked to the central bank's long-term bond rates. It's similar in the cases of Sri Lanka and Pakistan. And the central bank's long-term bond rates by and large follow the neoclassical Fisher equation where the nominal interest rate is a summation of the real interest rate and expected inflation. While the real interest rate, linked with the real economy, should be more or less stable, the nominal interest rate can go up if expected inflation rises, and rates must fall when inflation drops. Our fiscal gurus seem to disregard this theory entirely. It's a threat to the banking sector. The ministry's behaviour, which defies Fisher's formula, neither follows the dynamics of inflation nor does it understand why real interest rates matter for savings. This duality is creating an interest rate anarchy in the entire banking sector, making the most powerful tool of the sector defective. This is the fiercest threat to the banking sector and one which actually masks the ministry's fiscal incapacity. This is one of the main reasons why private investment as a share of GDP has remained almost stagnant for years. This is also one of the main reasons why Bangladesh still ranks below its neighbours in the Ease of Doing Business Index of the World Bank. Thus, institutional irregularities and a lack of understanding of the theoretical underpinnings are at the root of the weaknesses of our banking sector including the default culture and poor governance. We live in a society whose ranking in the Knowledge Economy Index is one of the poorest in Asia and the Pacific. Policymakers seem to be more comfortable creating space for obedience to compliance, and not as comfortable freeing up space for knowledge, research, expertise, and skills. Despite trumpeting about innovation et al, we are the least innovative nation in Asia. We go on and on about our impressive growth figures, but we have failed to generate adequate jobs for the youth in the country. The informal sector still accounts for more than 80 percent of our labour force. Where is this growth going? Doesn't it nullify the truth of Okun's law which says that higher growth generates higher levels of employment? Banking has come to a crossroads, but better ways can still be found. More autonomy for the central bank can be ensured by getting rid of the banking division of the ministry whose dual role is weakening the central administration of BB. We don't need the National Savings Department. Banks are supposed to take on the role of deposit mobilisation. NSD's nonmarket rates are obviously distortive for the market and private investment. Bangladesh shouldn't turn into a \"savings society\". It needs investment more than ever before. More autonomy and greater economic insight of the central bank leadership, along with the elimination of fiscal trespassing on banking affairs, are the answers for a healthier banking sector in Bangladesh.

Frustration, anger and fear have been growing in occupied Kashmir since August 5, when the Indian government stripped the region of its semi-autonomous status and imposed a curfew and a communications blackout. While some call and text services for mobile phone services were previously restored in the region, text messaging services were again blocked on Tuesday. The clampdown has now continued for over 70 days. According to Radio Pakistan, Friday is being observed as Kashmir Day across the country to express solidarity with Kashmiris. In this regard, sirens were rung at 3:00pm and people stood up to express solidarity with their Kashmiri brethren. A communications blackout in Kashmir region is fuelling a fake news war with Pakistan, as both sides unleash a deluge of disinformation to fill the vacuum and shape opinion. \"Both sides are stoking tensions, and both sides benefit from the information vacuum to fill the void with their own narratives and push them to domestic and international audiences,\" said Jan Rydzak, who has researched related topics at Stanford University. \"Pakistan cannot afford to let (the Indian) government's 'business-as-usual' narrative flood its citizens' social media feeds; India cannot afford to let reports of mass incarceration and chaos flood theirs.\" Disinformation has ranged from old photos from Gaza purportedly showing how India has turned Kashmir into a \"living hell\", to old images of happy children falsely claiming all is well in \"the new Kashmir\"."

The study covers six areas including the Thana(s) Savar, Roopganj, Keraniganj, DAP (2010), the Gazipur part under DAP and the Dhaka metropolitan area. We learned that since 2010, the city has lost around 43,200 out of the total 187,958 acres of wetlands that Dhaka had. That means we have lost 22 percent of our wetlands over the span of nearly a decade. When we look at wetland, there are three types: flood flow zones, water retention areas and water bodies like rivers, canals, lakes and beels. In the DAP area alone, we are losing 2,500 acres of wetland every year. Breaking down the overall loss over the nine-year period, we find that 27 percent of 141,069 acres of free flow flood zones, around 34 percent of 10,419 acres of water retention areas and eight percent of 36,497 acres of other wetlands were grabbed or filled up. In the main city, we have areas like Basila, Bashundhara residential area, Beraid, Amin Bazar, and North Uttara that have been severely affected. The conversion of wetlands which should have been conserved has been done in the name of development and urbanisation, but the reality of course is that such massive violation of DAP has been made possible because of a lack of good governance and oversight. When we look at the fact that Dhaka has been a magnate for economic activity and that has been drawing people by the millions hailing from diverse backgrounds, it is easy to imagine why the realtors have cashed in on a building boom to support an expanding economy. As put by Professor Adil Mohammed Khan, General Secretary, BIP, \"conservation of water bodies like rivers and canals, wetland, retention areas and flood flow zones are all vital to making development and urbanisation sustainable maintaining an ecological balance.\" This is where policymakers got it wrong. By touting Dhaka as the premier investment hub without thinking about developing townships or smaller towns in the periphery of the capital city, we have been left with demand for housing that far outstrips the availability of land. The irresponsible planning and development of the city which simply ignored the DAP and where Rajuk has turned a blind eye to the all-out grabbing of water bodies was highlighted during a thought sharing episode back in 2017 between Rajuk and realtors where the latter basically told Rajuk that it is ludicrous for Rajuk to try and reclaim what has already been grabbed. They went on to state that Dhaka is actually better off without its wetlands because the only purpose water bodies serve is to increase the mosquito population. Experts contend that without these water bodies, the city faces many problems, one of which is water-logging. Back in April, 2018, the city had witnessed 55mm of rainfall in six hours which was enough to produce knee-deep water in major residential and commercial areas. Although city authorities had been working on a major overhaul of the drainage system, the fact of the matter is that today, the city is lacking in enough canals and lowland to let the water run out. But because we have been lacking in foresight, Dhaka's lowlands and canals are being filled up at an unprecedented rate and it simply cannot handle any heavy deluge. That explains why Dhaka has only two percent area dedicated to water retention against a requirement of 12 percent for a city of this size and when we factor in that nearly 90 percent of Dhaka is covered in concrete, the rainy season water has no way to drain out to water bodies and we end up with water-logging on city roads. Filling up wetlands in violation of DAP has been made possible because the custodians of the city turned a blind eye to the syndicate of businessmen backed up by political influence, working with corrupt officials over the years. The bad practices have now become institutional and with no accountability to speak of, laws are violated at will for profit is king and there is enough money to go around superseding the need for a balanced approach to city development.

The coastal district saw an average of 55-millimetre rainfall in the 12 hours, which can be considered as this year's highest in the area, said officials of the Department of Agricultural Extension. A number of roads, vast crop fields and many fish enclosures in Bagerhat Sadar, Mongla, Rampal, Sharankhola, Morrelganj and Kachua upazilas have been badly damaged. Farmers are worried as the water level rises during high tides. Bagerhat Sadar Upazila Fisheries Officer ASM Russell said fish from at least 250 enclosures have been washed away due to the flooding caused by continuous rain. Thousands of fishermen will suffer huge losses if there is further downpour, he added. Nakib Ohid, chairman of Badal Union Parishad in Kachua upazila, said at least 2500 crop farmers and several owners of shrimp enclosures in the union face serious losses due to the flooding. \"People's movement is badly disturbed as roads are under knee-deep water in our area. Many shrimp enclosures are flooded,\" said Musfikul Islam of Karapara village in Bagerhat Sadar union. \"The excessive rain caused rotting of the roots of some vegetables. However, the damage would not be that much if there is no further rain,\" said Rustom Sheikh, a vegetable grower of Kachua. Talukder Abdul Baki, panel mayor of Bagerhat municipality, said survey work has started as a project is going to be implemented to reduce waterlogging in the municipality. Aftab Uddin Ahmed, deputy director of the Department of Agricultural Extension in Bagerhat, said, \"The heavy rain resulted in the flooding that caused damage to betel plantations and vegetable fields. However, the losses will be minimum if water recedes quickly.\""

      "text": "The government sought financial support from the development partners to implement the ambitious Delta Plan that would need $37 billion by 2030 for ensuring food and water security and fighting disasters.  The Planning Commission shared the plan with the development partners at the National Economic Council (NEC) conference room at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar in the city yesterday. Shamsul Alam, member of the General Economics Division (GED), made a presentation on the plan. Representatives of multilateral, bilateral development partners, including the United Nations resident coordinator Mia Seppo, were present at the programme. Ideally, the government wants to implement the plan with its own funds, but the plan needs vast amount of money and hence the development partners' support, Planning Minister MA Mannan said. The government will welcome the development partners if they become interested, he said. As per the Delta Plan, which was approved in September last year by the NEC, were primarily selected for implementation. Of them, 65 would be infrastructure projects and 15 aimed at enhancing institutional capacity, efficiency and research. The required fund for the projects would come from the government, Green Climate Fund, development partners, foreign direct investment and the private sector. At present, the government spends 0.8 percent of the GDP for Delta management projects and programmes. To implement the plan, 2 percent of the GDP would be required. Bangladesh is likely to get $2 billion assistance from the Green Climate Fund every year. Besides, about 0.5 percent from the private sector's annual income could be added to the Delta Plan fund. Coastal, Varendra (Barind) and drought-prone, haor and flood-prone, Chittagong Hill Tracts, riverine and urban are the six areas to be given priority by the Delta Plan. Due to climate change, the country's agricultural production may seriously be affected.  The production of paddy and wheat may decrease by 17 percent and 61 percent respectively. About 70 percent of the areas in 16 districts, where the poverty rate is very high, are most vulnerable to natural disasters, the planning ministry document mentioned. Mannan said the Delta plan will be emphasised in different development plans including the upcoming Eighth Five-Year Plan. The representatives of development partners urged the government to be strict against river pollution and grabbing to cut the impacts of climate change."

      "text": "Several hundred people, mostly children, gathered at a paddy field in Bankina village of Kalihati upazila of Tangail district. They were witnessing something they had never seen before. A part of a paddy field, overflowing with fully-ripened harvest-ready paddy, was set ablaze by its owner. While the children were cheering at the \"bonfire,\" as they could not perceive the gravity of the incident, some people were trying to console a weeping Abdul Malek Shikder, the owner of the paddy field, while others were trying to extinguish the fire. Abdul set fire to the fruit of his hard labour out of sheer desperation. He had already spent more than Tk 25,000 to cultivate and irrigate his 52 decimals of land. Then, he just learnt that he had to pay at least Tk 900-1000 to a labourer, along with providing food and accommodation, to harvest the crop. A land of this size required at least 10 to 15 labourers. However, he would not get more than Tk 500 from selling one maund (one maund is 40 kilogrammes) of paddy. Abdul was shocked to his core when he learnt about this rate. This meant that he would not be able to hire a single labourer to harvest his crop. He says, \"When I saw my fully ripened paddy was being reduced to food for rats and birds, I could not control myself. Sometimes I thought of committing suicide. I had taken a loan to purchase seeds, pesticides and fertiliser and I didn't know how I would pay back the loan when the price of paddy is this low. Then, out of desperation, I set my field on fire.\" Abdul was not alone. Another farmer named Nazrul Islam also set fire to his paddy field because he could not afford to harvest his crop due to the low price of paddy. In several districts, farmers like Abdul have taken to the streets demanding fair prices for paddy. And while the farmers are being given a nominal price for their hard-earned harvest, the costs of rice and all other essential commodities are on the rise. This year, in different parts of the country, the price per kilogram of rice has increased up by Tk 3-5. Now, a farmer has to purchase a kilogram of coarse rice at Tk 50 and half a litre of bottled water at Tk 15 whereas he is being forced to sell every kilogramme of paddy only at Tk 12.  Kazi Sazzad Zahir Chandan, general secretary of Bangladesh Krishak Shamiti (Bangladesh Farmers' Association) says, \"Farmers have agreed to sell paddy at the government fixed rate of Tk 1,040 per maund of paddy. Despite the fact that a rate has been declared by the government, they are being forced to sell their paddy at less than half this rate. The middlemen and millers are making a huge profit by depriving the farmers.\" Every year the government takes the initiative to procure rice and paddy directly from the farmers at a fixed price. However, the government procures such an insignificant amount of paddy that it cannot influence the market at all. For instance, last year, 19.5 million tonnes of Boro rice was harvested in Bangladesh and the government procured only one million tonne of that. As a result, most of the farmers have to sell their paddy to the middlemen and millers. According to Abdul and his neighbours, \"During every harvest season, the local political leaders and their henchmen suddenly become rice-paddy traders. Many of us cannot afford the transport cost of shipping our crops to the rice mills. We are forced to sell our paddy harvest to these seasonal traders. They are rich people and have sufficient storage facility. Sometimes, they sell the paddy to the rice mills at a profit, and sometimes they trade with the government.\" These middlemen sell their stock to the government buyers and the millers at the government fixed rate of Tk 1040 per maund of paddy but they purchase paddy from the farmers at only Tk 500-600 per maund. In this way, these middlemen make more than a hundred percent profit while the farmers incur huge losses.  Considering increasing production costs, the government is supposed to increase the buying rate of paddy to ensure a fair price for the farmers. For instance, in 2017, the government's fixed price for each kilogramme was Tk 24 and in 2018 it was increased to Tk 26. However, this year, the government did not increase the price at a time when price of rice and all other commodities are increasing. Dr Mohammad Yunus, senior research fellow, Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) says, \"We should keep in mind that the government procures paddy from the farmers not to ensure a fair price for them. They make the procurements only to replenish the government granaries. The Bangladesh government procures a very small amount of paddy from the farmers. China, Japan and Vietnam have formed purchase commissions to buy crops directly from the farmers and also to ensure that they get a fair price. Unfortunately, we have not formed any such body in Bangladesh yet.\" Just several days earlier, minister for agriculture, Dr Abdur Razzaque told the media that it would not be possible to increase the price of paddy. \"This season, the farmers will have to bear with the loss. We don't see any alternative at this moment. We will try to purchase as much paddy as possible. But the government's stockpiles are already full with imported rice. We are thinking of exporting paddy to increase its price but we need to think about making such commitments because Bangladesh is extremely prone to natural calamities,\" states Dr Abdur Razzaque. While the state is being indifferent to the plight of the farmers, hundreds of thousands of them are passing days in poverty and starvation. Many of them are moving to the cities to avoid meeting their debtors. Some of them like Abdul are taking desperate and destructive measures. This year on March 29, a farmer named Arjun Sarker from Naogaon district killed his wife and son by poisoning their food and then committed suicide. The officer-in-charge of Mohadebpur police station of Naogaon district says, \"Arjun borrowed money from several non-government organisations and individuals. Due to repeated loss in agriculture, he could not repay the debts. His debtors had been pursuing him for months.\" On April 19 this year, another farmer named Subroto Pramanik from Magura district committed suicide as his debtors seized all of his lands and his house when he failed to repay the interest of his debts. Subrata and Arjun's suicides are not isolated incidents. According to a 2013 research conducted by Centre for Injury Prevention and Research, Bangladesh, the monthly income of 55 percent of the suicide victims was less than Tk 4000 and most of them were involved in agricultural activities. In 2016, a local NGO of Jhenaidah called Society for Voluntary Activities (SOVA), conducted a survey on the suicide victims of the district and found that 63 percent of them were involved in agriculture and most of them committed suicide due to poverty and debt-related reasons. So far, loan default cases have been filed against at least 168,000 farmers by different NGOs, individuals and banks. Among these cases, arrest warrant has been issued against at least 12,000 farmers. Some NGOs and banks announced the names of the defaulters in the local bazaars. Md Mokbul Hossain, a farmer from Joatpur village of Cumilla's Burichong upazila says, \"I took Tk 20,000 as a loan from the Bangladesh Krishi Bank. When my name was announced in the market as a defaulter, I felt ashamed. I don't know how to pay the debt because I took out only Tk 20,000 but they filed a case claiming Tk 55,000 from me. How will I pay such a huge amount of interest? So, I have fled from my village and am now pulling a rickshaw in Dhaka.\" According to an official of the bank who requested anonymity, \"We announced names and filed these cases to create psychological pressure among the farmers. This measure has worked out already. Many of them have partially paid their debts back.\" However, the total amount of money owed by all the 168,000 farmers who have been prosecuted, is only Tk 561 crore. Muhammad Nazrul Islam, chairman of Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank, a specialised state-owned financial institution that finances the farmers of Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions, says, \"Most of the farmers take very small loans. And, according to my experience, they usually repay the loan in time unless they are hit by severe loss or crop failure. In this area, we are disbursing the loan at four percent interest and we never give any pressure to the farmers. I think we should decrease the rate of interest and make the loan payment system more popular and easier so that farmers feel more interested to take out loans from banks than from usurers and NGOs. This year, we are thinking of launching an agricultural fair where farmers will be able to sell their produces and repay their loan at the same spot.\" According to experts, the lack of a farmer-friendly policy has led to this crisis and it might worsen the situation in the near future. Dr MA Sattar Mondol, professor emeritus, department of agricultural economics and rural sociology at Bangladesh Agricultural University says, \"The agricultural ministry should conduct area-wise customised research to predict crop production all over the country. If we could conduct this research annually, such is being conducted even in India, our farmers and traders could prepare accordingly. Secondly, we must ensure automation in agriculture. We have ensured almost 100 percent automation in ploughing the land but we could not ensure it in sowing and harvesting the crop which are extremely labour intensive. We should also formulate a concrete policy regarding export and import of rice. After the flash flood of 2017, the government withdrew tariffs on rice import but did not reinstate the tariff in 2018. As a result, the government granaries are now flooded with imported rice and there is hardly any place left for the home-grown rice.\"     Just on May 20, the parliamentary standing committee on ministry of food recommended to stop all kinds of rice import immediately to recover from the situation. The committee has also recommended procuring more paddy from the farmers than the amount previously determined. However, according to experts, this decision has come too late to make any impact on the situation. According to Kazi Sazzad Jahir Chandan of Bangladesh Krishak Samity, \"The government must build temporary granaries in all the major rice producing areas. In this way, they can purchase paddy directly from the farmers and stockpile it properly. They should provide incentives to the farmers who have suffered irreparable losses so that they feel motivated to harvest paddy again. Otherwise, the situation will not improve.\" Development of high-yield crops has ensured sustained agricultural production in Bangladesh but due to the lack of a farmer-friendly agricultural policy, the farmers are not getting any benefit from the increased production. A manipulated and unstable market has been pushing a large number of farmers below the poverty line. If the state does not address this issue immediately with a sustainable and pro-farmer policy, our agriculture, our country's economic backbone will be broken in the near future.

      "text": "Stop discrimination and stand by farmers, demanded one placard. Buy rice directly from farmers, said another. Yet another screamed, \"Save farmers, save agriculture.\" Holding numerous such placards, farmers in different districts took to the streets yesterday, demanding higher prices for their produce. They formed human chains, held press conferences and blocked roads in Dhaka, Narayanganj, Sunamganj, and Gaibandha. They also burned their rice on the streets in frustration. A maund (37kgs) of rice is selling at Tk 500-600, which is much lower than the production cost. And farmers are incurring losses of around Tk 300 per maund, protesters claimed. Disappointed by the low prices, one farmer in Rangpur set fire to his standing paddy last week. Many other farmers are threatening to stop growing rice since they make hardly any profit from growing the staple. The prices of rice have dominated the mainstream as well as social media news since harvesting began last month.  In the capital, farmers held a press conference at Dhaka Reporters' Unity where they called on the government to ensure fair prices to save them. \"We can survive if the government fixes the price at Tk 800-1,000 per maund,\" said Sohrab Hossain, a farmer from Rangpur. \"We'll be forced to stop growing rice if we have to count losses,\" he said. Farmers also demanded that the government identify the real growers, offer them loan at 2 percent interest and reduce power bills for irrigation. In Gaibandha, farmers blocked the road at Dariyapur Bazar with paddy sacks for an hour, demanding fair prices. They want the government to set up procurement centres at each market. They also formed a human chain along the road, holding placards and banners with various demands written on them. Farmers would get a fair price if the government procured the rice directly from them, they said. Similar protests were held in Sunamganj, Sylhet, and Narayanganj. In many areas, farmers were getting Tk 400-450 for a maund of rice, less than half the production cost of around Tk 1,000. On the other hand, prices of agriculture inputs like fertiliser, seeds, diesel, and pesticide are rising every year, farmers said.  At the human chain in Sunamganj, protesters said the district's total Boro production this year was 13.12 lakh tonnes. Of the amount, the government will purchase just 6,508 tonnes, meaning farmers will have to sell them at a lower price and incur a heavy loss. Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzaque assured farmers and said the prime minister was worried about the falling rice prices. \"We're looking at various options to address the issue,\" he told a seminar in the capital yesterday. According to him, procuring paddy directly from farmers will not push up the price. \"It's very difficult to solve the problem immediately,\" he said. \"Export could be one solution. But this will create a problem in case of a natural calamities.\"  Meanwhile in Naogaon, a group of students, teachers, journalists, agriculture officials and members of different charitable organisations yesterday harvested paddy for Abdur Razzak, a marginal farmer, for free. Razzak, from Biharinagar, said he grew paddy on his 63 decimals of land borrowing money. But he could not harvest it because he does not have the money to pay the labourers. \"Labourers are charging very high,\" he said. Upazila Agriculture Officer Selim Reza learnt about this somehow and then discussed the matter with local charity and volunteer organisations. He then formed a team to harvest paddy of marginal farmers. \"Every morning, we will harvest paddy for one farmer in the upazila voluntarily,\" said Selim. Earlier, volunteer groups in Tangail did the same so that farmers could save the labour cost. [Our correspondents from Sylhet, Dinajpur, Gaibandha and Narayanganj contributed to the story.]"

      "text": "Science and Technology Minister Yafes Osman on Friday inaugurated the installation of core catcher, a device for catching the molten core material, at Unit-2 of Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant. The initiative, following completion of installing core catcher at Unit-1 of the plant two months ago, is meant for ensuring effective passive safety system there, officials said. \"The core catcher has been introduced for ensuring the highest safety measures for the country's first nuclear power plant, especially keeping in mind the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan,\" said Yafes Osman after inaugurating the installing of core catcher. Atomstroyexport, engineering division of ROSATOM, the general contractor of Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, is conducting the installation of 'core catcher' at the site. Core catcher for Rooppur NPP is designed considering the condition of the site and its safety requirements, said Vury Kushelev, chief engineer of Atomstroyexport. \"With improved hydro-dynamic and shock absorption properties, it is more resistant to seismic activities. It is also equipped with flood protection features and possesses simplified installation and assembly technology,\" he said. Core catchers at the two units of the Rooppur plant will make it safe from any disaster, said Dr Shawkat Akbar, project director of Rooppur Nuclear Plant. \"The plant, being constructed with the technical and financial assistance from Russia, will have two units, each with 1200MW capacity. World's latest 3+ Generation VVER 1200 reactors have been chosen for the plant, completely fulfilling the safety requirements set by International Atomic Energy Agency,\" he added.  "

      "text": "This newspaper on March 24 reported how Rajuk is trying to change land allotted for educational institutions and environmental preservation in the Purbachal Project into commercial and business plots. Since the scheme was launched in 1995, due to pressure from \"influential people\", the plans have been changed five times, leading to arable land and flood flow zones being gradually reduced. In the latest revision, Rajuk intends to decrease the 269 acres dedicated to 157 educational institutions to 119 acres for more residential, commercial and other purposes. We reported insiders telling us that this has been done to increase the number of plots, thus allowing allotment to more applicants. More importantly, we also learned that doing so would compromise \"some indispensable standard characters and features\". One result would be that educational institutions, which would have had their own playing fields, would now share common fields. That a planned project is being changed over and over again as per the wishes of the wealthy, influential and politically-connected people, is absurd. More so because a common complaint about our rapidly urbanising city is the lack of green spaces and playing fields for children. The High Court's comment, in declining to approve the proposed revision earlier this year, comparing it to a \"smart trick\" turning playgrounds of educational institutions into commercial plots, is revealing. Yet, Rajuk has now appealed the HC's directive. Going back further, we see more anomalies in this project. There are allegations of secretly allotting institutional plots from areas earmarked for schools and playgrounds, violating a 2014 HC judgment. Officials approached for our report turned out to be evasive or vague in their answers. Trees have been felled and water bodies have been filled up indiscriminately, which could harm the environment and make the area concrete jungles with very little open spaces. No one in Dhaka is unfamiliar with the consequences of such a scenario. The court's decision is yet to come. But we would urge the authorities to launch an independent investigation into the anomalies and allegations of pressure from certain quarters. Otherwise, it is public money that will be spent in an unaccountable manner according to the whims of the rich and influential."

      "text": "Residents of at least 30 villages living close to Monu River embankments in Kulaura upazila of Moulvibazar are at risk as the river has once again begun to erode the banks in Koterkuna area. The erosion of the river bank began on last Thursday, causing suspension of vehicle movement on Koterkuna-Hazipur road for one week, reports our Moulvibazar correspondent. Local people fear that the embankment may collapse any moment as a crack in it keeps widening. Earlier, the river damaged the embankment in the first week of last month. According to local sources, the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) repaired the crack with wooden pillars and sand sack structures in an attempt to curb damage from the escalating erosion, but the repair works failed to contain the river and were washed away in last few days. Ali Hosain, a resident of Koterkuna village, said that due to heavy rains for the last one month the flood control embankment at Koterkuna area got damaged twice. Persistent rains and water from the upstream hills have turned the river dangerous, he said. \"I have two acres of land near the embankment and I run my family with the income from selling the crops. I won't be able to maintain our livelihood if the embankment collapses,\" said Sadhon Das, a resident of Monu village. Abdus Salek, a farmer of the same village, said erosion also hit the embankment last year and villagers contained the damage by erecting corrugated iron fences and dumping sand bags. The locals also demanded alternative road for the 30 villages as vehicles movement on the Hazipur-Koterkuna road get suspended every time the embankment is damaged, This important embankment has been facing erosion threat due to mindless sand lifting by a section of local influential people, locals alleged. \"How can we celebrate Eid when we are tensed if the embankment collapses again? If it will collapse in Eid time then we will lose all our assets and crops,\" said Nargis Banu, a resident of Monu village. Hazipur Union Parishad Chairman Abdul Bachhit Bacchu said the 30 villages near the embankment and the Koterkuna market will not survive if action is not taken immediately. \"We have marked 67 points in the Sadar, Kulaura, and Rajnagar upazilas which are at risk due to river erosion,\" BWDB Executive Engineer Ranendra Shankar Chakrabarti said \"A Tk 1,000 crore development project will soon be proposed to build permanent boundaries around the river embankments which will contain the river waters in the rainy season,\" he added."

Emergency services tackled thousands of calls from people overnight around the city of Townsville, where evacuation centres were filling up. Crocodiles were even spotted in suburban streets, pictures on social media showed. \"Once in a century event happening here. I have never seen the likes of this before,\" Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp TV, in a state often hit by cyclones and flooding. Palaszczuk said there could be thousands of homes affected by the flooding. A record 1.16 metres (3.8 ft) of rain has fallen across the Townsville area over the past seven days, with another 100 millimetres expected to be dumped over the area on Monday, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Major flood warnings have been posted for several rivers. The weather bureau warned of \"dangerous and high velocity flows\" along the Ross River after the flood gates were opened fully at the Ross River dam on Sunday, releasing about 1,900 cubic metres of water a second. Even after the release, as of Monday morning, the dam was still at 229 percent capacity, holding about 532,000 gigalitres of water, or roughly as much as Sydney Harbour. \"We're hoping to see an easing trend from tomorrow,\" bureau spokeswoman Jess Gardner said, adding that the rains could move further south, towards Mackay, a major coal exporting area. Townsville, a major port for northern Australia, is the country's top exporter of copper, zinc, lead and sugar. The Port of Townsville remains open, but cargo loadings have faced interruptions due to heavy rain, a port spokeswoman said. She did not have details on specific shipments held up. Global miner Glencore Plc, which exports copper, zinc and lead from Townsville said as of late last week there had been no impact on its operations."

      "text": "Dengue, the notorious mosquito-borne menace in the country, is back and so is the familiar paranoia that accompanies its advent every monsoon. Splashed across the front pages of newspapers and the headlines of news channels are the alarming numbers of new cases of dengue every day. People are grappling with anxiety and confusion over the news that dengue is manifesting itself in a different form this time; patients are presenting with atypical features and their conditions rapidly deteriorating in the absence of timely medical intervention. \"The epidemiology of dengue is complex and it still remains poorly understood. It entails the host (humans), vector (Aedes mosquito) and viral (Dengue virus) status; these factors are further influenced by demographic, behavioral and societal determinants,\" explains Professor Dr Quazi Tarikul Islam, during his speech at the seminar \"Dengue: changing trends and management update\", organised by the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) and the Bangladesh Society of Medicine. \"Aedes mosquito is very adaptive.  It has evolved in terms of both longevity and survival due to climate change and different socio-cultural and economic factors of human habitation,\" adds Dr Islam, who is also editor-in-chief of the national guideline on dengue. He refers to the shift in the affected age group earlier, dengue fever used to be uncommon in adults, whereas older age groups being affected have been reported not only in Bangladesh, but also in Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia. Another shift is that the largely urban-centric disease has now spread to rural areas too. \"Moreover, changes in the dengue virus are altering its ability to cause infections. In sequential or secondary infections, the manifestations become severe,\" says Dr Islam. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), warmer temperatures due to global warming accelerate the development of mosquitoes and reduce the time it takes for them to become infectious. In addition, increased rainfall leads to more ideal breeding sites and high humidity enhances their chances of survival. The worsening flood situation this year, coupled with the unusually high temperatures, could have triggered such alterations. Concerns over the re-emergence of a new serotype have also been voiced by experts. There are four distinct serotypes of dengue. The national guideline on dengue, published by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), documents that following its first outbreak in Bangladesh back in mid-2000, the prevalent serotypes of dengue were the first three; among them, serotype-3 was only predominant till 2002. A study published in the journal New Microbes and New Infections states that the re-emergence of serotype-3 in 2017 may have been responsible for the massive dengue outbreak in Bangladesh last year. Previously, no cases of serotype-3 or serotype-4 had been seen in Bangladesh after 2002--the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control & Research (IEDCR) found only serotype-1 and serotype-2 in patients' serum samples between 2013 and 2016. In a report in The Daily Star last month, Dr HM Nazmul Ahsan, associate professor at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, said that the number of serotype-3 cases were higher than the others last year and that would most likely prove the same this year. In a subsequent report, Kinkar Ghosh, an epidemiologist at Dhaka Shishu Hospital, also stated to The Daily Star that the pattern of dengue was different this year. Patients presented with new as well as faster-acting symptoms indicating that the serotype of the virus had changed but why, he stated, is as of yet uncertain. When a person is infected with one serotype, his/her immune system confers him life-long protection from re-infection from the same serotype. But he/she still remains vulnerable to infection from the other serotypes after a transient protective state lasting for a few months. That is when the complications ensue. Secondary infection with a different serotype is the most significant risk factor leading to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome--severe forms of dengue, where mortality rates can be as high as 20 percent. However, it is to be noted that Bangladesh's dengue mortality rate is still significantly lower than that of other endemic zones of dengue such as Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Hence, the re-emergence of serotype-3 in Bangladesh where serotype-1 and serotype-2 were prevalent for over a decade increases the chances of cross-infections and consequently, the severity of dengue. Which is why it is important to immediately screen anyone with a fever during this time, for dengue. \"Plasma leakage [the fluid portion of our blood, plasma, leaking from the blood vessels] or impaired ability of our body to regulate bleeding may proceed to multi-organ failure. When three or more organs fail, there is an 80 percent risk that it will culminate in death. That's what concerns us,\" states Dr Md. Robed Amin, associate professor of medicine at DMCH and an editor of national guideline at the seminar. Droves of patients have been getting admitted to hospitals and medical care is stretched thin. \"The workload is overwhelming as we constantly juggle between evaluating new patients and monitoring the admitted ones. But we're always here for them,\" says a duty doctor at DMCH, busy examining dengue patients. \"Early diagnosis and appropriate quality care can bring down the mortality rate to below one percent,\" states Dr Sanya Tahmina, line director of communicable disease control at the DGHS. \"Our case fatality rate (CFR), calculated by dividing total deaths by total identified cases, is quite below one percent. The numbers (as of July 25) show eight deaths out of 9,256 cases, yielding a CFR of only 0.09 percent. Even if you consider the death rate to be 28 as per some unsupported sources, CFR is still 0.3 percent--still below one percent.\" \"We have an efficacious national guideline on the management of dengue. We regularly train our physicians to enhance their skills. This year, from January to June, we've trained around 2,000 clinicians both in government and public sectors including the consultants of Intensive Care Units about the clinical management of dengue,\" states Dr Tahmina. Considering diagnostic efficacy and quality care as the metrics, we are performing quite well. Our doctors are putting in their best efforts to rein in the epidemic, but is the government doing the same?   Kazi Md. Shaimul Reza is a medical student at Dhaka Medical College."

      "text": "The Ichhamati, the once vibrant river that features prominently in several Bangla literary works, has turned into a narrow channel filled with garbage, thanks to rampant encroachment and indiscriminate dumping of waste. At some places in Pabna town, the river looks like a dying canal with the riverbed silting up, while at some other points, garbage chokes the water flow. Originated in the Padma in Pabna's Shibrampur, the Ichhamati runs an 84km course across the district before meeting the Jamuna in Bera upazila. Today, the river is hardly visible in Banglabazar area, near the point of its origin, because of roads, commercial and residential buildings, and business establishments. Reckless encroachment even forced the river to change its original course, said Kabir Mahamud, the deputy commissioner of Pabna. According to the government's Cadastral Survey (CS) records, published in 1922, the 9km section of the river that flows through Pabna municipality had 88.58 acres of riverbed. But the area dropped to only 54.53 acres as shown in the most recent Bangladesh Survey (BS) record map in 2013, said Md Mostak Ahmed, the district settlement officer, who has recently been transferred to Dhaka. In the CS map of Pabna's Ramchandrapur mouza, the river was identified as a single plot. But the recent BS survey map shows that the same plot is divided into 26 pieces, of which only one belongs to the Ichhamati and the rest have been grabbed. Similar pictures were found in all nine mouzas of Pabna municipality. In the last couple of decades, the 9km course through the municipality has been massively encroached upon. At some places, the river has completely disappeared. \"Encroachers have grabbed the riverland, and with the passage of time, many of them already prepared land documents. Paying revenue tax, most encroachers even attained the legal right to own the riverland as their personal property. Everything was possible because of administrative weaknesses,\" said Mostak, without elaborating on the weaknesses. The major portion of the river was occupied by petty settlements in the 1940s before the abolition of the feudal system, he said, adding that the illegal occupants marred the riverside land survey at that time. POLLUTION The Ichhamati has also been a victim of mindless pollution. Visiting different points of the river recently, this correspondent saw those apparently have turned into breeding grounds of mosquitoes and garbage dumping sites giving off foul smell. At some places, sewer from residential and commercial buildings flow into the pitch black water of the river. \"We have hung signboards in different parts of the Ichhamati asking people not to dump waste. But no one is paying any heed to our request,\" said Kamrul Hasan Mintu, mayor of Pabna municipality. \"The pollution won't stop unless public awareness on the issue is raised,\" he said, adding that they did not have adequate manpower to check the pollution. For years, different local citizen bodies have been campaigning to save the river from land grabbers and pollution. \"My children can never imagine how the Ichhamati looked three decades ago when we used to bathe in it,\" said Mirza Hasan Shahid, a resident of Pabna town. He lamented how land grabbing has changed the shape and direction of the river. PROJECT ON THE CARDS\n Following the campaign, the water resources ministry has taken up a project to restore the water flow in the river. As part of the project, the Institute of Water and Flood Management and Buet experts completed a feasibility study spending Tk 3.44 crore in June. The study covers the entire 84kms of the river, however, the focus of the project will be on 38km of the river from Banglabazar point in Pabna Sadar upazila to Madhupur point in Santhia upazila. \"Encroachment and pollution massively damaged 38km of the river, and there is no current in this portion. Through the feasibility study, experts tried to get a total picture, identifying illegal structures and the actual area of the river,\" Mosharaf Hossain, assistant director of the Water Development Board, Pabna said.  The experts submitted the feasibility study report last month and the ministry of water resource is making the DPP (development project plan) of Ichamati said Kabir Mahamud, the deputy commissioner, Pabna. \"Design plan and development plan of the river would be included in the DPP. After completing the DPP we will take initiative to evict the illegal occupation from the river according to the requirements of the project plan.\" the DC said. Meanwhile, the Pabna district administration conducted an eviction drive on September 1, removing eight structures, including a portion of a brick kiln, a road, and some concrete houses at Char Shibrampur sluice gate point in the sadar upazila, near the confluence of the Ichhamati and the Padma. Johurul Haque, executive engineer of WDB, Pabna, said three acres of land were freed and eight structures were removed at the point of the river's origin. \"A brick kiln owner had taken part of the river [near the sluice gate] on lease from Water Development Board for fish farming. After taking the lease, he filled up the river there and built a brick kiln. He also constructed a two-storey office building,\" Deputy Commissioner Kabir Mahmud said, adding that the lease was not renewed after 2016. The official said the district administration was trying to restore the water flow by freeing areas at the origin of the river from grabbers. They would also verify the private ownership claims of the river land near the sluice gate, he added. In addition to routine drives, massive-scale eviction will also be carried out before WDB takes up the dredging project, he said. If the district administration conducts eviction drives now and hands over the riverland to WDB, the latter will not be able to keep the land free from encroachment, the DC said. Once the mega project starts, the eviction will be sustainable, he said. It is not sure when the project may start, but the DC expects it to begin soon.  "

      "text": "Cashing in on the growing demand for spices ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, the second largest religious festival of the country, traders have increased prices of spices to earn some extra buck. Demands for spices like cardamom, cinnamon, cumin, clove, raisin, black pepper, ginger, garlic, onion and vegetables like potato go up ahead of Eid-ul-Azha. Prices of each kg of cardamom, cinnamon, cumin, clove, raisin and black pepper have soared by Tk 20-250 in a week. Retailers and wholesalers have been trading blame over the rise in prices. The Daily Star on Thursday visited several retail and wholesale markets in the capital, including Karwan Bazar, Moghbazar and Jatrabari, and found a significant gap between wholesale and retail prices. Garlic (Chinese) was selling at Karwan Bazar wholesale market at Tk 140 per kg, but retailers were selling it at Tk 180 to buyers. Middle and low income groups are bearing the brunt of this spike in prices. Mizanur Rahman asked for 100gm of cardamom at Yusuf General Store in Karwan Bazar. He gave the shop owner a Tk 500 note and got Tk 230 back. Surprised, Mizan asked the retailer Md Yusuf about the price of cardamom. \"Tk 2,700 per kg,\" Yusuf curtly replied. Talking to this correspondent Mizan said, \"It's robbery in broad daylight.\" \"Now, I'll have to skip buying one or two items,\" he added. Wishing to remain unnamed, a retailer at Jatrabari kitchen market said most of the spices are dry products. \"These can be stored for a long time,\" he said. Due to flood, prices of vegetables shot up last month. Things started getting back to normal last week. However, green chili is still being sold at over Tk 100. A kg of green chili was sold at Tk 50 last month. It is now being sold at Tk 120. Abdul Wahab, a wholesaler at Malibagh kitchen market, said because of rain the price of green chili is high. \"It will go down within a week or two,\" he added. Contacted, Md Enayet Ullah, president of Bangladesh Paikari Garam Masala Baboshayi Samity, claimed that prices of spices, except cardamom and cinnamon, are stable. \"We import cardamom from India and there is a shortage of it in the Indian market. Price of cardamom will go up further after Eid if this scarcity continues,\" he said. \"We import cinnamon from China but heavy rain there has created a crisis,\" he added. Enayet claimed such fluctuation in prices happens throughout the year. \"Media gives special focus on this ahead of Eid, that's why it seems unusual,\" he said.  'PRICES HAVEN'T GONE DOWN SINCE RAMADAN IN PORT CITY' Meanwhile, spice market remains volatile in Chattogram with price of several spices showing an upward trend both in the wholesale hub and kitchen markets for last couple of months, frustrating consumers ahead of Eid-ul-Azha. Even yesterday, price of onion, garlic and ginger marked a Tk 3-30 rise per kg at Khatunganj wholesale market. According to wholesalers, delay in getting imported garlic and ginger from Chattogram port created a crisis, which caused the sudden hike. Wholesale price of most spices witnessed a gradual increase since Eid-ul-Fitr. Price of cumin, cinnamon and cardamom marked a sharp rise around three weeks back as buyers started stockpiling those from Khatunganj and adjoining Asadganj -- country's major spice hub, imported through the port. Import of spices increased in the recently concluded fiscal year. But wholesale and retail price of cardamom, cumin and cinnamon saw a Tk 50-400 rise per kg in a span of one and a half month while price of cloves remained stable. Higher price of spices in global market and delayed delivery from port due to vessel congestion are some of the reasons behind the hike, said market insiders. They also attributed it to the increase in demand and multi -level selling of same goods ahead of Eid-ul-Azha. Md Sekander, a trader who usually buys spices from importers and sells to a third party, said at Khatunganj, goods are sold several times from one party to another before buyers purchase it. Import of cardamom, cinnamon, cumin and cloves through Chittagong port in fiscal 2018-19 was around 4.53 crore kg, which was 4.36 crore kg the year before. Meanwhile, consumers are bearing the brunt of the price surge. Yesterday morning, while visiting Karnaphuli CDA Market, a housewife was seen arguing with a retailer as he was charging Tk 260 for 100 grammes of cardamom, a Tk 30 hike for the same quantity she bought a few weeks back. \"With Eid approaching, they will probably charge more. Prices haven't gone down since Ramadan,\" she told this correspondent. Mohammad Suman, the retailer, said he bought \"average quality\" cardamom at Tk 2,350 a kg from Khatunganj two weeks ago and was selling it at Tk 2,600 per kg. \"It was Tk 1,900 a kg one month back,\" he said. Regarding such hike in wholesale market, Faruk Ahmed, proprietor of Khatunganj-based Faruk Trading International, said their import cost went up due to various calamities in many countries such as India and Guatemala. Like cardamom, cinnamon was also imported in last 12 months till June. Retailers were found selling the spice at Tk 500 a kg, a Tk 100 hike. Import of cumin dropped a bit while its price rose by Tk 50 in last two months. Price of cloves, imported from Indonesia, Madagascar and Brazil, remained stable. Meanwhile, yesterday's sudden hike in wholesale price of onion, ginger and garlic prompted retailers to raise the rate. Jahangir Alam, a rickshaw puller, said he bought one kg garlic at Tk 160 in the morning but found that price reached Tk 190 in the evening."

      "text": "Despite serious discord and disputes between the countries of South Asia, the concept of a common future of the region based on increasing cooperation among the people and governments has somehow survived because of strong geographical, economic and cultural factors. More recently however, this concept itself has been increasingly threatened. India has moved closer towards its eastern borders. Pakistan had already leaned more closely towards both China and some Arab countries. To a lesser extent, Nepal and Sri Lanka have also moved towards China. Sectarianism has weakened cultural relationships in South Asia level. Terrorism has become an issue of relentless discord and tension. The decline of the overall prospects of close cooperation at this juncture is tragic as this is probably the time when close cooperation is most needed. South Asia is passing through a critical phase of climate change which requires various countries to focus on new emerging developmental and environmental challenges as well as increase cooperation to face these extremely difficult challenges for which the region is not at all well prepared. South Asia has 16 percent of the world's population, over 30 percent of the world's poor, only 2 percent of its land and 1 percent of oil resources. So, the developmental challenges here were already acute before the advent of the disruptive manifestations of climate change. Experts see South Asia as a region where some of the most serious impacts of climate change are likely to emerge. In addition, a range of related life-threatening environmental problems have also been worsening in the region, including freshwater scarcity, decline in water tables, serious threats to rivers, deforestation, soil/land erosion and sharp decline in natural fertility, air quality, threats to safe food and proliferation of various hazards. The need to reduce GHG emissions while meeting basic needs of all people with dignity is a huge challenge, the most important real challenge for South Asia. South Asia can stand up to this challenge in a sustained situation of peace and stability where it is possible to devote most efforts, talents and resources for this. The actual situation, sadly, is a very different one. South Asia is commonly seen to consist of eight countries--India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Bhutan and Maldives. Two of these are nuclear powers. The chances of actual use of nuclear weapons have increased in recent times. It is well known that any use of nuclear weapons, or any accident relating to these, can have destructive impacts not just in the nuclear weapon countries but also in neighbouring countries. While six out of eight countries of South Asia have absolutely no involvement with nuclear weapons, they may have to bear the consequences of their use or even deployment/storage by two countries. South Asia has emerged as one of highest arms-importing regions of the world. Combining direct and indirect expenses, the total military expenditure may be much higher than what is stated officially, denying precious resources for urgent development and environment protection tasks. South Asia has seen two extremely violent partitions and a much higher number of violent secessionist movements and insurgencies. It has also seen four wars involving India and Pakistan, and a persistent state of foreign invasion and internal violence in Afghanistan for over four decades. Terrorism is a big source of violence but also has a larger and more destructive role as a trigger for an all-out war. On the whole, war and civil war, secession and insurgency are likely to have claimed nearly six million lives in South Asia in the post-World War II phase. The number of people who were displaced or ruined in other ways is higher. Sectarianism and sectarian violence remain at high levels. Secularism has very dim prospects. Democracy has had its ups and downs in various countries of the region. It survives at rather low levels of achievement. Democracy needs to be strengthened from many points of view, one of the most important being the creation of conducive conditions in which alternative viewpoints can emerge and acquire strength. These alternative views should seek peace, harmony, environment protection, justice and equality (including gender-based justice and equality). An accompanying effort would be to make dedicated efforts to spread values of universal peace, non-violence, non-dominance, non-discrimination and social equality (including at the gender level), a wider understanding of honesty and sincerity as well as some basic human rights and duties. Such an effort if sustained for about five years can help to change public perceptions so that democratic leaderships devoted to peace, justice and environment protection can emerge.

They grow different types of vegetables like pointed gourd, pumpkin, aubergine and bottle gourd in Kharif-1 (March-July) season, said Bimal Kumar De, sub-assistant agricultural officer of Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) in Kurigram. Nine upazilas in the district have been affected by flood early this month and the floodwater started receding from the areas in the last couple of days. But the growers in eight unions of the four upazilas still continued harvesting the vegetables as floodwater could not enter their fields situated in highland areas. The agricultural officer said around 4,038 hectares of land in the district have been brought under vegetable cultivation this year. As the flood has affected 3,739 hectares out of 4,038 hectares of fields, vegetable prices have shot up, he said.  Saidur Rahman of Kaley village in Belgachha union of Sadar upazila said \"I have been cultivating vegetable in Kharif-1 season for the last four years and earning good profit.\" He has cultivated pointed gourd on 12 decimals of land spending Tk 6,000 this year, said the farmer. \"I've already sold pointed gourds at Tk 10,000,\" said Saidur, adding that he is expecting to earn Tk 16,000 more from sale of the vegetable. Grower Rezaul Islam of Sanwashi village in Halokhana union under Sadar upazila said he cultivated aubergine on 10 decimals of land and pointed gourd on 22 decimals of land this season. \"I have already sold the vegetables at Tk 31,000. I'm also expecting to earn Tk 43,000 more in the next two months,\" said Rezaul. They are getting good profits from the vegetable farming this season every year, he said. Another farmer Akbar Ali of Chhinaye Haat village in Chhinaye union of Rajarhat upazila said he cultivated aubergine on 40 decimals of land and pumpkin on 16 decimals of land spending Tk 19,000 in May this year. \"I'm expecting to earn Tk 42,000 from sale of the vegetables in the next two months,\" he said. Kurigram DAE Additional Deputy Director (Plant Protection) Sasty Chandra Roy said there are many vegetable growers in Rajarhat and Sadar upazilas and they are known as adapted farmers, who cultivate different types of vegetables during this period of the year, and get a good profit. In the rainy season, extra care is needed for pollination, he said."

      "text": "What if the fruit you love is available in the market not only for a few months, but throughout the whole year? And what if this very fruit does not need to be imported but is grown locally and sold at a street cart in your neighbourhood? That is the goal of the Year-Round Fruit Production for Nutrition Improvement project -- to make fruits available all over the year and meet the nutrition demand of the population. The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) has been implementing it since 2014-15. An adult is supposed to consume 250 grams of fruit daily but per capita intake is 80 grams in Bangladesh at present, according to the agriculture ministry. Even a decade ago, local fruits were limited to Bangladesh's hot and humid summer. People keenly waited for May, June and July when mango, litchi, jackfruit and most other fruits would make their way to the market. The second month of the Bangla calendar, Jaistha (mid-May to mid-June), is aptly called the Madhu Mas (honey month) because most of these fruits become available around this time. However, the scenario has changed now. Several fruits are found almost all the time. Mehedi Masood, the project director, said earlier fruits would be available during the three summer months, but the government is focusing on year-round production. \"Now you will find guava, papaya, pineapple and some other fruits almost round the year. We are also expanding the production tenure of mango.\" Since the inception of the project, more than one lakh farmers were given training on fruit cultivation through the horticulture centres, the official said. In addition, 21-22 lakh fruit trees were planted across the country during the period, he added. \"Inspired by the initiative, farmers planted 2 crore fruit trees on their own.\" Not only are some fruits found for a longer period in the market, the cultivation of high-yielding varieties has increased the overall fruit production many times over. In 2006-07, 4.74 lakh hectares were under fruit cultivation yielding 87.86 lakh tonnes, according to DAE. The acreage has since jumped to 7.24 hectares, with an output of 1.21 crore tonnes in 2017-18. In these 11 years, fruit production went up by 33.26 lakh tonnes. \"Good profits and demand for fruits in local and international markets encourage the farmers to produce more fruits, using high yielding seeds,\" the project director said. Besides, more exotic fruits are grown locally now, catering to a larger fruit market. Alongside the traditional local varieties, foreign fruits like avocado, rambutan, strawberry, orange, date, dragon fruit, and fig have become popular and locally available. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Bangladesh is one of the highest fruit-growing countries in the world, and it is the 10th largest tropical fruit producer. Over the last 18 years, the country's fruit production has been increased by 11.5 percent on an average annually, the UN body estimates. According to the agriculture ministry, 56 varieties of fruits were cultivated in Bangladesh about a decade ago, the number of which has increased to 72 now. With the cultivation of fruits increasing and the list of new varieties growing, Bangladesh's dependency on fruit import has already come down. According to the customs department, the first eight months of 2017-18 fiscal year saw the import of 2.82 lakh tonnes of apples, mandarins, oranges, pears and grapes. It went down to 2.52 lakh tonnes during the same period of 2018-19. Agriculturalists say people usually buy imported fruits between September and January when fruit production and supply remain poor. After the launch of the round-the-year fruit project, various fruits have become available almost all over the year. Guava tops the list. It is available even in winter. Project director Masood said the farming of Thai guava, which was introduced in 2005-06, has expanded across the country because it bears fruit quickly and commands a good price. \"It takes only about five months to grow the fruit,\" he said. In 1980-81, Bangladesh's guava production was 9,000 tonnes, which rose to 506,478 tonnes in 2017-18, registering a 56-fold increase in 37 years. Bangladesh has also been among the top 10 countries in the production of significant fruits -- second in jackfruit, seventh in mango, and eighth in guava, according to FAO. The cultivation of nutritious varieties like dragon fruit, avocado, pomelo, watermelon, muskmelon, Burmese grapes or lotkon, jujube, hog plum, and Indian gooseberry or amlaki has largely increased over the last 4-5 years. \"A silent revolution has taken place in the country's fruit sector. People are taking Thai guava instead of apple. As a result, apple import is dwindling,\" project consultant SM Kamruzzaman told The Daily Star. \"We are planning to ensure availability of fruits round the year.\" He also said currently they are planning to produce mango round the year and expand the production of persimmon and high-yielding oranges. Project director Mehedi Masood said the government plans to ensure round-the-year availability of fruits by 2030."

      "text": "Bangladesh being the most downstream country in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basins is faced with the double whammy of too much water flowing in transboundary rivers in the rainy season (causing deluge) and too little flow during the lean season (negatively impacting the economy, livelihood, and the ecosystems).  Currently, out of the 54 transboundary rivers, there exists only one treaty with upstream India to share the flow in the Ganges during the lean period. The lack of control over the flow of water in transboundary rivers puts Bangladesh in a very precarious situation. Being somewhat frustrated by the stalemate in negotiations over water flow in transboundary rivers, the policymakers in Bangladesh are considering the possibility to manage internal water resources to meet the demands, and not to look towards her upstream neighbours for availability of water. A decision to meet all water-related issues internally can set a very bad precedent for future negotiations on water-sharing agreements. Apparently, Bangladesh will manage its own water resources internally through dredging rivers and containing water in rivers to be used during lean season. As per international laws and the existing Ganges Treaty with India, Bangladesh, as a lower riparian nation, has a legitimate right on all transboundary rivers, as does India on all transboundary rivers with Pakistan, China, Bhutan, and Nepal. The very existence of Bangladesh depends on water and sediments carried by transboundary rivers. Only eight percent of water and sediments that flow through Bangladesh are generated within its own territory. Transboundary rivers are common wealth and resources that belong to all co-riparian nations and the ecosystems that those rivers support. It is expected that all civilised nations will settle their differences and agree on equitable and fair share of water and sediment resources in all transboundary rivers. Recently, Bangladesh adopted a long-term plan called the Bangladesh Delta Plan (BDP 2100) to manage water and land resources in the country in the face of climate change. Under the BDP 2100, the entire territory of the country is divided into six \"hotspots\": coastal zones, Barind and drought-prone areas, haor and flash flood areas, Chittagong Hill Tracts, river systems and estuaries, and urban areas. The BDP 2100 is a water-centric plan. Freshwater availability was identified as the only cross-cutting and common challenge for each of the hotspots. It is hoped that once the BDP 2100 is implemented, all water-related problems will be solved one after another. But what the policymakers do not realise is the fact that the success of the BDP 2100 heavily depends on the availability of flow in all transboundary rivers. In the BDP 2100 documents, four future economic growth scenarios are projected based on the availability of water resources. As per the projection scenarios outlined in the BDP 2100, extreme water condition in the country will lead to stagnation in economic growth.   As per the BDP 2100, a total of 19 projects have been selected for immediate implementation, one of which is the construction of the Ganges Barrage and Ancillary Works that includes revival of the Gorai River flow. The success of the proposed Ganges Barrage will completely depend on the availability of water flow downstream of the Farakka Barrage. Although there exists the Ganges water-sharing treaty, a recent study carried out by scientists from Canada, Bangladesh (BUET), and the Netherlands reported that during the period of 1997-2016, Bangladesh did not receive its guaranteed share during critical dry periods with high water demand 65 percent of the time. The Abridged Version of the BDP 2100 document highlighted the importance of upstream development activities as follows: \"Being highly dependent upon developments at upstream, the diversion, use or storage of flows from the transboundary rivers is of major importance to Bangladesh.\" All six specific goals outlined in the BDP 2100 revolve around various aspects of water resource development. One such goal is to develop effective institutions and equitable governance for in-country and transboundary water resource management. The Ganges Treaty will expire in 2026. What will be the fate of Bangladesh if India does not allow any flow during the lean season, as is the case for the Teesta River? What about unilateral control of flow by China and/or India over the Brahmaputra or the Barak River? Would that too be okay for Bangladesh? So, how can the policymakers assume that Bangladesh will not depend on others for water flow in transboundary rivers? In a recent statement, Mamata Banerjee reiterated her position to not allow additional flow in the Teesta during the lean period. The policymakers in Bangladesh should continue to pursue the central government of India and convince them to resolve all transboundary river issues immediately for the sake of regional peace and friendship. Amidst the new political atmosphere in New Delhi, Dhaka needs to revive all negotiations on Teesta water-sharing. It is also high time for the Joint River Commission to work on the technical details for renewal of the Ganges Treaty. It is hoped that the new treaty on the Ganges water-sharing and all other future water-sharing treaties will have a guarantee clause similar to that of the 1977 agreement which ensured Bangladesh would receive a minimum of 80 percent of the scheduled flow during extremely low flow events at Farakka Barrage. In fact, it would be wise to sign a long-term treaty for all transboundary rivers involving all co-riparian nations in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basins. The central government in India has been maintaining the position that they are ready to sign the Teesta water-sharing treaty but it is due to Mamata Banerjee's opposition that they are reluctant to do so. Now that Mamata Banerjee's grip on power does not stand on firm ground, the central government in India should press her to come on board and do the right thing.  In addition to negotiating for her fair share on all transboundary rivers, Bangladesh needs to better manage her water resources within the country. All rivers, canals, ponds, wetlands, and estuaries need to be properly demarcated and reclaimed from encroachers. The pollution in these water bodies has to be tackled. The High Court's recent ruling to recognise all rivers as legal entities can serve as a guiding principle in providing necessary protection to the rivers. PM Sheikh Hasina recently directed all district commissioners in the country to take necessary actions to remove all physical structures from rivers and canals that create an obstacle to the natural flow of water. The High Court's decision backed by the PM can usher a new dawn for stewardship of the rivers in the country. Bangladesh should also ratify the UN Convention on Non-Navigational Water Course (1997) and encourage other co-riparian nations to do the same. If all parties ratify the convention, then it can serve as a basis for fair and equitable negotiation for all rivers in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basins.

      "text": "A 50-foot-long crack has developed on the flood control embankment near the Manu river at Hashimpur village in Kulaura upazila due to unabated sand extraction from the riverbed, threatening vast tract of croplands and several adjacent villages. Locals claimed that due to mindless extraction of sand, portion of the town protection embankment might go under water anytime. As a result, vehicles and pedestrians were crossing the area amid risk of accident. According to the upazila administration and locals one Badrul Islam of Dakkhin Bazar area in upazila took the lease from the district administration for Tk 1.20 crore.But defying the law, the lessee has been extracting sand from Kotarkona, Salon, Dhundalpur, Jalalpur, Hashimpur, Tukoli and Matabpur areas near Kotarkona Bridge and Manu Rail Bridge, locals alleged. Meanwhile, demanding a stop to the heinous act, locals said the embankment might go into the riverbed anytime if water level in the Manu river sees a rise due to sudden rainfall during this time of the year. While visiting the area this correspondent found labourers were extracting sand using six extraction machines in Salon and Kotarkona areas. Of the two areas, one is very close to Kotrakona Bridge on Kulaura-Shamshernagar road while the other is some 500 meters far from the Manu Railway Bridge on Sylhet-Akhaura rail route. Kutub Uddin, a resident of Hashimpur area, said, \"Due to unabated lifting of sand a large crack has developed on the flood control embankment on June 26.\" Hazipur Union Parishad (UP) Chairman Abdul Bashit said a 50-foot-long crack has developed on the Manu river due to unabated sand lifting. According to the law, one cannot lift sand from one kilometre radius of any railway bridge, but the lessee is not paying heed, he said, adding that the embankment might collapse anytime due to the mindless sand lifting. Lessee Badrul told this correspondent over phone that sand is being lifted as per the conditions of the lease. Kulaura Assistant Commissioner (Land) Sadi Ur Rahim Zadid said earlier sand was being lifted from different points along the embankment on Kotarkona road, threatening the two nearby bridges. The lessee was asked not to extract sand from within one kilometre area of the two bridges, he said. "

      "text": "A city is not mere buildings, streets and spaces; it is a theatre of social actions. And it is in that theatre, according to the American urbanist Lewis Mumford, that \"man's more purposive activities...work out, through conflicting cooperative personalities, events, groups, into more significant culminations.\" I see the city as an existential theatre of our actions, practices, dreams and imaginations. Cities are millions of stories. A city is neither hell nor heaven; we make cities in the shadows of our selves. We are the city. In experiencing Dhaka as the toughest city in the world, the challenge is not one of solving its endless crises but in imagining and presenting the idea of how one should live in the theatre of the collective. The narrative of Dhaka as a city continues to be framed by technical or economic notions around urbanisation. Urbanisation is a poor term to embrace the fullness of a city. Talks of urbanisation distract the discourse of cities with number games, not taking into account that a city is shaped, bit by bit, not only by policies and ordinances, but imaginations and practices. Statistics do not show how a city can be designed and lived in its fullest human, social, aesthetical and ecological potential. Such a dynamic is best approached by the term \"urbanism.\" While the city is about material and spatial facts, urbanism, the French urban thinker Henri Lefebvre points out, is about social relations staged there. Our definition of the city has to be revised, and planners have to learn how to engage with the existential quotient of the city. As the most ancient human artifact, the city now reverberates with a greater poignancy as a human collective. In much of Asia, there has been a quantum leap in the urban domain. Ushered by economic and climate migration, and administrative impetus, more people now live in cities. China is literally building 20 cities every year, and India proposes spending USD 20 billion in seven years for its National Urban Renewal Mission. Despite the fact that contemporary cities are responsible, according to architectural critic Warnock-Smith, for \"history's greatest disparity between the wealthy and the poor,\" cities are the key catalyst for the future of the planet, its transformation, but most importantly, the destiny of subsequent generations. Cities can still be the most beautiful collective dream, as the urban wizard from Brazil, Jaime Lerner, claims. Rejecting the notion that the city is a problem, Lerner insists that cities instead are solutions to the human nature of living in a socialised manner. In transforming the Brazilian city Curitiba as its mayor, the architect Lerner proved that the city is not defined by smog, crisis and deluge, but as an exemplar of how we should live as a decent society in which the fruits of urbanism are available to all citizens. What about Dhaka then? Drawing people from different economic, ethnic, social and professional categories in one space, Dhaka first of all needs a civilised mode for addressing differences and diversities. Awash with many building enterprises in a booming economy, most buildings in Dhaka remain as enclaves unsure of how to form civic precincts or connect to the public fora. What should be celebrated are designs of spaces that engage the civic realm, from the larger and monumental scale to micro levels, and from the planned to the spontaneous. At the same time, Bangladesh's urban future cannot be all about Dhaka even if it hogs up all our investments and imaginations. To think beyond Dhaka, to engage the multitude of small towns--the mofussils--is now critical. Unmapped and untheorised, small towns are developing on a faulty premise: adopting a spurious Dhaka as a role model while abandoning their own stories. From the deluge of the late 1980s that drowned Dhaka to the unforgettable tragedy of the Rana Plaza factory, Dhaka can be easily written off as evidence of an apocalyptic city-site, a landscape of unruly industrial globalisation. Death in the Plaza was also a consequence of Dhaka's irresponsible planning, a result of an abysmal failure by city leaders to establish what should be built where and how. This is the dark side of urban development, when economic growth and consumer capitalism connive to drive human desires. Along the way to Gazipur in the north of the city, on the riverbanks towards Narayanganj, and on the road past Savar, concrete and steel rods replace the vernacular of bamboo and thatch. Multi-storied buildings--six- to ten-story high--hum with the music of a far-off Gap or Walmart. Freshly laid sand-beds on wetland announce the arrival of an upcoming housing society. The transformation of Dhaka and its regions, in the name of urbanisation, has been relentless and brutal. Nalas, dobas and pukurs--the lowlands--are filled to shore up tottering towers, without any basic recourse to safety and buildability, and petit goons with the blessings of bigger leaders become crorepatis, and enter the mystical chain of globalisation. By creating one landfill after another, emaciating rivers and canals, and decimating flood-plains and agriculture, Dhaka makes for a perfect candidate for an urbanisation without urbanism. An urbanism for Dhaka, I have argued, has to be conceptualised from the hydrological property of the delta, the foundational basis of our existence. Surrounded and infiltrated by a labyrinthine and delicate network of rivers and canals, tissues of wetlands and floodplains, and organic formations of mounds and settlements, Dhaka needs a new approach to city-thinking. Dhaka's primary urban challenge is one of imagination, of not being able to think of an appropriate form even when there are inspiring clues. Once Dhaka City hosted spacious green spaces, majestic trees, crisscrossing canals, civilised riverbanks, and boats in the heart of the city. Dhaka can actually be the garden city and a place by the water it always was. The idea of the city as a garden is not a fantasy but an urban ideology that combines civic wellbeing and environmental sustainability. The master architect Muzharul Islam imagined \"the whole country as a concentration of population in certain areas in a certain way, but even then within gardens.\" He perceived Dhaka not just having a collection of large gardens but the city itself as a garden. \"If you can do this [tall buildings] utilising the highlands of Dhaka city,\" he suggested, \"even now, you can place here a population three times its current number, and, at the same time, keep the lowlands as lowlands, keep the water bodies, and create gardens\" (1992). A big part of the challenge in re-imagining Dhaka lies in appreciating its landscape reality--the lowlands, the water bodies, in short, the powerful hydrology that surrounds and infiltrates it, and creates an \"ecology of the edge.\" The edge is made of a magnificent but precious terrain of land-water mass of wetlands, flood-plains, canals, and agricultural fields. The edge is where the dry meets the wet, the \"developed\" meets the \"primitive,\" and infrastructure meets the structure-less. This is also where the urbanite meets the farmer, the land-grabber discovers his opportunity, and the uprooted often makes her habitation. Site/s of the biggest battle in the city, the terrain of the edge, is determined by the presence and flux of water. It is a battle because it is in that terrain the instruments of landfill and embankments are in play. Most urban planners and policymakers focus on the core city. Even when they are dealing with the edge, they see it in the image of the core. Official planning is unable to conceptualise the special and unique condition of this edge. Without that realisation it is easy to participate in the destruction of the city's hydro-geographical landscape. An audacious vision for Dhaka has to begin from the edge so that the norm of planning, in which the core is privileged, is reversed. The edge conditions of Dhaka present the possibility of re-negotiating the social and economic--as well as conceptual--separation between the city and its conventional anti-thesis, whether the village or agricultural plains. The edge is where new forms of space organisation will have to be reorganised in response to a fluctuating landscape, along with devising newer types of economic, civic and social opportunities. In the meeting of an older form of the city with agricultural and hydrological landscape, a new conception of a city will have to be developed that integrates urbanism, agriculture, infrastructure and flooding. Only then will a water ethos circulate in the veins of a city's imagination. Kazi Khaleed Ashraf is an architect and directs the Bengal Institute for Architecture, Landscapes and Settlements."

Moreover, thousands of people at different villages in those two districts have been suffering a lot as their dwelling houses and vast tracts of agricultural land remained inundated due to the impact of the recent cyclone. Besides, tidal water keeps entering those villages through the damaged portion of the flood control embankment since the cyclone hit the southern region. Of the damaged embankment, around 30 kilometre is under Patuakhali Water Development Board (WDB), 10.5 kilometre under Kalapara WDB in Patuakhali and 18.5 kilometre is in Barguna, according to Patuakhali and Barguna WDB offices. Patuakhali WDB Executive Engineer Mohammad Hasanuzzaman said of the 30 kilometre, about 5.5 kilometre was damaged fully and 24.5 kilometre partly. The most affected villages are Mehendiabad, Ranipur, Golkhali, Hazikhali and Charkhali, all along the Payra river in Mirzaganj upazila. \"We have already sent a letter to the higher authorities, seeking allocation of fund to repair the badly damaged portion in an emergency basis,\" he said. Meanwhile, in Kalapara, around 10.5 kilometre dyke was badly damaged and tidal water keeps entering through the damaged portion in different villages. Of the villages, Kamarpur, Nizampur, Puran Mohipur, Yousufpur, Monoharpur, Najibpur under Mohipur union and Chairpara, Nawapara, Chowdhuripara, Nayakata, Munshipara, Chandupara, Hasnapara, Poshurbunia under Lalua union are most vulnerable. Abul Talukder, a resident of Nayakata village, said the flood control embankment along on the Ramnabad river was badly damaged during the super cyclone Sidr and later repaired hurriedly. Feroza Begum of Charipara village said they often suffer from waterborne diseases as their houses and croplands remained inundated during the rainy season. \"We cannot even cook our food properly during the rainy season,\" she said. Lalua Union Parishad Chairman Shawkat Hossain said at least 16 villages under his union have been inundated after a portion of the flood control dyke along the Ramnabad river broke down. Kumar Sastik, acting executive engineer of Kalapara WDB, said they sent a fax to the higher authorities for allocation of fund. After getting allocation we will take step to repair the dyke, he said. In Barguna, due to lack of repair around 18 kilometre of the flood control dyke at 37 spots is under threats. The most vulnerable areas are Chotobaliatali, Noltona, Lakurtala, Dalvanga, Angerpara, Jangalia, Patakata, Gudighata, Gulishakhali, Chalitatali and Noli under Barguna Sadar upazila, Boloybinia, Deshantorkathi and Jhopkhali under Betagi upazila, Kakchira, Charlathimara, Ruhita, Jintala and Padma under Pathorghata upazila, Ramna, Shafipur, Chechan, Shinrabunia and Borotaleshwar under Bamna upazila and Poshorbunia, Poshimghotkhali and Purbochila under Amtali upazila. Barguna WDB Executive Engineer Dipak Ranjon Das said they have informed their higher authorities about the damaged embankment."

Mentioning that the economy of Bangladesh stands on strong position overall, the premier said the investment is increasing gradually and the balance of payment of Bangladesh remain in good position due to high growth in export and remittance. Inflation remains under control while the budget deficit remains limited within 5 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), she further said. In this context, it can be expected that the economic growth will accelerate further in the days to come, she said. \"Bangladesh will turn into a developed nation with $ 16,000 per capita income and the poverty will be a matter of distant past in this Sonar Bangla (Golden Bangla) in 2041,\" Sheikh Hasina said. According to the World Economic Situation and Prospects 2019 of the United Nations, Bangladesh was one of the 10 top growth economies in the world in 2018, she added."

Moreover, 34,999 houses were damaged completely and 5.47 lakh were damaged partially. Reportedly, relief materials for the affected people were also inadequate, although the government might have made sufficient allotment. These people are still struggling to find a livelihood and rebuild their houses. And as the flood water recedes, river erosion has started taking its toll in many areas, destroying schools and homesteads of people. While the state minister for the ministry of disaster management and relief has termed TIB's allegations as baseless, the fact remains that many of the flood victims have been left with no relief at all. We think the government should move away from its denial mode and conduct investigations into the allegations made by the corruption watchdog. The institutional limitations in the government's planning of relief distribution, rehabilitation programmes, emergency response and overall preparedness for such a disaster should be addressed properly for better management of floods in the future. Also, stringent action should be taken against those, including the public representatives, involved in corruption."

      "headline": "The future of transport infrastructure in Bangladesh",
      "authors": null,
      "text": "The ongoing infrastructure projects will definitely improve our transportation system. We need to assess this development from a historical perspective. At the time of Partition, the transport infrastructure in East Pakistan was very poor. There were only a few hundred kilometres of pucca roads. Due to our unique geographical setting, one has to cross rivers to travel from one place to another. At that time, as there were very few bridges people had to cross rivers through water transports such as ferry and boats. Basically, riverways and railways were the major modes of communication.  \n We notice some development after 1947. Some bridges were built but those contributed little to the overall improvement of our road network. In our case, a major barrier to the development of surface transportation network, e.g. road and railways, is the high construction cost. Since this is a flood-prone low-lying country, the roads and railways need to be built on embankments which incurs huge extra costs. Moreover, earthquakes need to be considered during designing of these surface structures. In hindsight, I strongly feel that we should have emphasised more on the development of waterways and railways. However, the current government has taken some initiatives to revive the water and rail transportation networks. To cut the long story short, the opening of Bangabandhu Bridge over Jamuna in 1998 was a milestone in the development of our transportation network. It enabled speedy movement of vehicles across the river. Although there was initial reservation from the co-financiers, particularly the World Bank, we added rail tracks to the bridge. Due to the late incorporation, there remain some weaknesses and concerns about the durability of the bridge with the rail line. Load and speed restrictions have been impasses. Recently, a decision has been taken on the construction of a separate railway bridge across Jamuna River. It will be a major improvement for the railway sector. Due to the overall weaknesses of our transportation infrastructure, we have not been able to achieve our development goals. Foreign investors also shy away from investing here. The good news is that the situation is improving. For example, the inauguration of two bridges--Second Meghna Bridge and the Second Gumti Bridge on the Dhaka-Chattogram route--has significantly reduced the travel time between Dhaka and Chattogram.  We are heavily dependent on our sea ports for both export and import. The capacity of the Chattogram port has increased lately, but it is still insufficient. The second sea port is the port of Mongla. We have already started the construction of the Payra Deep Sea Port, though there are some problems associated with the project. The channels of this port need to be dredged continuously. Once these projects are successfully completed our international communication will be hugely boosted.  Another important international connectivity network is the Asian Highway. Although our government has decided to get connected with this network, it has not been started yet. Earlier the government was a bit unsure about the route connecting Bangladesh to India. The route plan was revised later and it shifted towards Meghalaya through Shillong. The initial route map was designed mostly on flat terrain that was supposed to go through Karimganj in Assam, onwards to Monipur and then to Myanmar. There is another route plan for creating links between the south-east part of Bangladesh and Myanmar. Since the route is planned to pass through Rakhaine state (an area where Rohingya people live), Myanmar government is not interested to cooperate with the project. Therefore, currently it is feasible for us to establish road links in the north-eastern side for the Asian Highway. The biggest contribution to the Asian highway will be the inauguration of the Padma Bridge. It will directly open a road to Kolkata from the south-western part. Another road link can also be established between Bangladesh and Nepal on the north-western side. Now, coming to Padma Bridge. Earlier there were several complications associated with the project. One of the major problems was funding. Development partners like the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, JICA, Islami Development Bank had initially agreed to co-finance the construction of Padma Bridge. Later, they pulled out of the project citing corruption charges. In 2013, the government decided to construct the Padma Bridge with its own funds. It was undoubtedly a bold step as the government decided to execute a project worth USD 3.5 billion without the assistance of foreign development partners. The construction project began in 2014. Acquisition of land was a major challenge. Earlier, in the government funded projects people affected by the projects were involuntarily displaced and provided with a lump-sum amount of compensation based on prices reflected in the government records. But the policy for project affected people (PAP) used by the development partners stipulates that the PAPs should be rehabilitated in such a way that their living standards don't falter, rather it improves with the completion of the project. They also now get compensation comparatively easily. As for the Padma Bridge project, 70,000 people have been relocated and almost everyone appears to be happy. Though the project was supposed to end in four years, the contractors could not meet the deadline. It is also important to note that from engineering point of view, Padma Bridge is one of the most challenging projects in the world. We had to devise new construction techniques to cope with the unique geographical condition of the river. We have calculated the highest likely stream flow for the next 100 years to design the foundation and river training works of Padma Bridge. The bridge is being constructed in such a way that it would allow nearly 1,40,000 cubic metres of water to pass under the bridge every second. The water flow in Padma is considered to be one of the highest in the world. Therefore, we need to make sufficient openings. River training is another key challenge to implement this project. Approximately USD 1 billion is being invested in river training works on Janjira and Mawa banks to hold the river in its current position. The riverbed fluctuates a lot due to water flows. The riverbed may scour up to 62 metres or 200 ft. Therefore, we are building the foundation in such a way that it can sustain the load even if the riverbed scours down to 62 metres. We are also taking other disasters into consideration, such as earthquakes, cyclones, accidents like ship impact etc. So, it is crucial to make the foundation strong to carry the entire load of the bridge. We are using \"steel piles\" as foundation and driving those piles 124 metres deep into the riverbed. Most of these are non-vertical (flaring outwards from the pile cap at an angle of around 9.5%) so that the piles can resist lateral loads (from earthquake, wind, ship impact) better. The Padma Bridge was designed between 2010 and 2012. It was designed on the basis of soil test conducted during that period. However, it was difficult to mobilize equipment to collect samples from deep channels within the short time frame. Another round of soil test was carried out by the Contractor during the construction, and it was found that the soil under some piers was of different characteristics. Most of them are silt; some are sand and some are clay. We had to avoid resting the piles on clay as it would slip away under high pressure. It would put the whole structure at risk. Now our options were to either have the tip level above the clay layer or below the clay layer. Since it is nearly impossible to drive the piles below the clay layer, even using the strongest hammer available in the world, we have reduced the length of the piles and increased their numbers. Earlier the design was based on six piles under each of the 40 piers in the river, but now we are using seven piles under 22 piers. Even after following this method, we figured out that some piers are unable to withstand the load. Hence, we had to resort to another new technology using some chemicals for grouting. Due to such redesigns and adjustments, the completion of this project is being delayed. However, the good news is that we have resolved all the challenges. All the 262 piles have been driven to the desired depths. We expect the bridge to open for vehicle movement by December 2020. Undoubtedly, the construction of Padma Bridge will significantly improve the communication network of the south-western districts which are now heavily dependent on ferry services. The Padma Bridge Rail Link is another important initiative that will connect Dhaka and Jessore via the Padma Bridge. It will improve the railway connectivity of the south-western region of the country. Most of the funding is from loan from Chinese Government. Under the G2G process, there is no provision for competitive bidding. Therefore, it is difficult to find out the project costs if they are comparable to similar projects. One of my suggestions to the designers was to set up more rail stations in places in Bikrampur like Sirajdikhan, and Srinagar along the route up to Mawa, which are urbanizing rapidly. If the proposal is executed, many commuters would be able to travel to Dhaka every day from these places which will significantly reduce pressure on the capital city. However, this proposal has not been included in the project yet.  To address the severe traffic problem in Dhaka, the government, with the help of World Bank launched a study in 2003, known as Strategic Transport Plan (STP), for the period 2005-25. This plan includes Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). The capacity of a line of MRT is quite high as 60,000 passengers can travel per hour in MRT Trains. The STP was revised in 2010 to include a few more MRT Lines. It can be both underground and over-ground. Due to repeated revisions of the route for MRT-6, the project has been delayed in taking off. However, the construction of MRT-6 is now being implemented. It is expected to end by 2021-22. The major problem with the project is that its construction process is causing huge traffic congestion in the city. The contracts for construction of MRT-1 and MRT-5 have also been signed. These will basically be underground transportation projects. It is going to be the newest addition to our transport communication system. Bangladesh Bridge Authority is also contemplating about running two more lines. Ultimately, there will be at least eight or nine lines in Dhaka, which may take up a minimum of 12 years for implementation. Only then will there be some improvement in the traffic situation in Dhaka. STP has a recommendation concerning the implementation of the bus route franchise system. Under the bus route franchise system, bus services will be operated by different companies on particular routes with valid permits. Recently, we saw competition among bus drivers of different companies operating in the same route competing against each other to take the passengers from the spot. Due to their unethical practices, they block the road by making their buses stop on the road, leading to major accidents. In addition to solving the aforementioned problem, the government should implement the parking policy to create more space on roads. Through these management measures, the traffic situation of the city can be improved with less investment than that of projects like MRT. One of the policies in STP is to give priorities to pedestrians. Unfortunately, the footpaths, which are occupied by hawkers, shops and construction materials, cannot be used by pedestrians, who have to resort to use of the roadway, leading to further congestion.    The plan for Dhaka Elevated Expressway was adopted in 2010. It is the first public-private partnership project in our transport sector. Dhaka Elevated Expressway will connect Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport with Kutubkhali via several important places like Mohakhali, Tejgaon and Kamalapur. The government will share 27 percent of the costs of the project, while the private partner Ital-Thai will bear the remaining expenses. The land required for the project has been handed over to this private company, but it will take some more time to implement the project since there are some problems concerning land acquisition and resettlement payment to the private landowners. The circular navigation system around the city should also be introduced. Since there are several rivers around the city, this system will be of great help in minimising the traffic problem. It was launched earlier, but was not successful due to the deployment of improper type of vessels. If implemented, this system could bring changes in the overall traffic system. Finally, combined effort is the best solution to reduce the traffic problem of Dhaka city. For example, we see no coordination between organisations such as LGED, Rajuk, North City Corporation, South City Corporation, while constructing flyovers. Furthermore, Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority has limited authority to exercise their rules and regulations."

      "text": "India is going to draw around 51.54 litres of water per second from the Feni river once the deal between Bangladesh and India is implemented, but doubts remain as to how much impact it would have on Bangladesh.   The Feni water-sharing agreement was signed in the presence of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi at the Hyderabad House in New Delhi on Saturday. Some experts say the drawing of water will have little impact on the downstream of the Feni river.  Yet, the deal regarding withdrawal of 1.82 cusec of water by India, to be used as drinking water for the people of Sabroom town in Tripura, triggered sharp criticism in Bangladesh.   The condemnation comes due to India dillydallying on signing the Teesta deal for last eight years even after finalisation of the deal and suspicions regarding the nature of the deal.  \"I think withdrawal of 1.82 cusecs of water will have very little impact in the downstream. After a series of discussions, we have agreed to provide them the water for drinking purpose. There is no shortage of water during the monsoon and during the lean period, the river has a minimum flow of the water around 110 cusecs,\" said KM Anwar Hossain, member, Joint Rivers Commission (JRC), Bangladesh. He explained the quantity of water in one cusec water was equivalent to 28.32 litres of water flow per second. So, 1.82 cusec will be equivalent to 51.54 litres water per second.  When asked when the water-sharing would start, Anwar said it would start soon as the MoU was already signed.   While there is optimism on a government level, questions remain regarding how much water is to be withdrawn and how it would be monitored.  Professor Saiful Islam of the Institute of Water and Flood management, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), said the discharge of Feni river was around 750 cusecs during the monsoon, while it was over 100 cusecs in winter.  \"That means they are going to withdraw around two to three percent of water from the river during the lean period, which would not be a problem.  \"But if they withdraw more than 1.82 cusecs, it may affect Muhuri-Feni irrigation project based on the water from Feni river,\" he said.  Around 230.076 hectares land area is under the Muhuri-Feni irrigation project. He, however, said it was necessary to sign deals on sharing of the water of all transboundary rivers.  Locals living by the Feni river in Khagrachhari said India had been withdrawing water from the Feni river \"unofficially\", by setting up small pumps at zero point.  Regarding the deal, many said there was confusion whether it was to draw 1.82 cusec of water or more.   \"If they withdraw 1.82 cusec of water, it will not have much impact downstream. But, if they withdraw 1.82 cumec instead, it will be a disaster for us because 1.82 cumec is 35 times higher than 1.82 cusec. So, the government should make it clear about the signed MoU,\" said M Inamul Haque, Chairman, Institute of Water & Environment.  According to the joint statement of Hasina's official visit to India, it is mentioned that 1.82 cusec of water will be withdrawn. A copy of the MoU, however, is yet to be made available on public domains. In regards to monitoring, JRC member Anwar said, \"Now India will invite Bangladesh to oversee the withdrawal activities jointly with them. They will set up water pumps to withdraw the water, while officials of Bangladesh and India will jointly monitor the activities,\" he said.  \"The officials will monitor some issues like whether the withdrawal activities cause any harm to the river, so it does not cause any erosion on the river bank,\" he said.

      "text": "The government has planned to construct a four-storey building on Bhashan Char for the UN and aid agency representatives to ensure effective monitoring of humanitarian activities for one lakh Rohingya refugees to be relocated to the island from Cox's Bazar.  It also planned to increase the height of the flood-protection embankment around Bhashan Char housing project from the present nine feet to 19 feet.  These are part of the 43 new infrastructure components meant to improve the facilities on Bhashan Char under a revised project which will be placed at the Executive Committee on National Economic Council meeting today.  The housing project on the 40 square km Bhashan Char, an island in Noakhali around 37 miles from the coast of the Bay of Bengal, was initiated by the Prime Minister's Office after vast tracts of forests and hills in Cox's Bazar were damaged due to some one million Rohingyas being housed there. Besides, there were also risks of landslides in Cox's Bazar.   By October this year, the Bangladesh Navy, which is implementing the project, completed the construction of 120 cluster villages on the island. Disaster management ministry officials said the concrete houses built were constructed four feet above the ground. The entire housing site is protected by a flood embankment.   There are also 120 cyclone shelters, which will also be used as schools, medical centres and community centres. Disaster management ministry officials said there are large swathes of land that could be used for livestock farming and fisheries on Bhashan Char.  There will also be education facilities in Bhashan Char as well, along with eight speedboats which will be used for transit, government sources said.   The refugees now live in crowded camps in Cox's Bazar. The government considers Bhashan Char cluster village a safer and better place for them.  The UN and other rights bodies, however, have been critical of the relocation plan of the Rohingyas to Bhashan Char, saying the island was isolated and flood-prone. They also asked to establish a regular ship service between Bhashan Char and the mainland.  Against this backdrop, the UN had proposed a visit to Bhashan Char by a technical mission on November 17 and 19. It, however, was postponed as Bangladesh asked for the terms of reference for the visit. Until now, the visit has not taken place, but its reason could not be known.  Meanwhile, the planning ministry proposed a revision to the project, increasing the budget to Tk 3,095 crore from Tk 2,312 crore. It has also proposed extending the project until November 2021. Shah Kamal, senior secretary of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, said the government planned to build a residential building and other facilities so that the UN and other aid agencies involved in the humanitarian assistance could stay there and operate their activities.    The government also wants to take all measures to ensure protection of all those involved in the humanitarian works and the Rohingyas who are to be relocated, he told The Daily Star on Sunday.  Officials said increasing the height of the embankment around the cluster villages was a new component of the project. Aid agencies had feared tidal surges and cyclones could make the housing project vulnerable.   Disaster management officials said the government wanted to ensure full protection and amenities for all in Bhashan Char.    Other new components in the project include construction of a jetty, helipads, two hospitals, four community clinics, a water discharge system, internal roads, shore protection work, land development, solar panels and an electric sub-station.  \"Once the displaced Myanmar residents are repatriated, the landless people of Bangladesh will be rehabilitated there. It will contribute to their socio-economic development,\" said a planning ministry brief. "

Locals said Gopgram Union Parishad (UP) Chairman and also Khoksa upazila unit Krishak League President Alamgir Hossain, with the connivance of government officials, felled the trees. The felling of the trees, worth around Tk 6 lakh, started after February 15, when construction work of a two-kilometre-long flood control embankment was undertaken on the road in the village.  The government departments concerned did not raise any objection or stop the political goons of the UP chairman when they started to chop the trees down, claiming to have purchased the trees at an auction of Water Development Board (WDB), alleged locals.  While removing the trees from the road, the thugs threatened witnesses with dire consequences if anyone wished to complain to the administration or police, they also claimed. A member of the same Union Parishad seeking anonymity said, \"Men of the UP chairman chopped down the trees.\"   On February 20, locals submitted a written complaint to upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) of Khoksa in this regard. Contacted, UNO Maffara Tasnim said a three-member investigation committee, led by Upazila Engineer Abdus Samad of Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) in Khoksa, was formed yesterday to probe into the accusation. The committee has been asked to submit its report within seven working days, she said, adding, \"Action will be taken after receiving the report.\" ABM Mehedi Masud, officer-in-charge of Khoksa Police Station, said at the directive of the UNO, a police team went to the spot and found the accusation of trees being felled is true. They seized eight pieces of logs from the spot, but was not clear whether those were chopped down illegally, he said adding that no one filed any complaint with them over the matter yet. Ariful Islam, section officer of WDB in Kumarkhali upazila, admitted that several hundred trees were felled and stolen although those were not put on auction.  \"The trees belong to us [WDB], while the road belongs to LGED. This happened due to miscoordination between WDB and LGED,\" he also said. LGED's Khoksa Upazila Engineer Abdus Samad said they did not authorise anyone to fell the trees. When this correspondent contacted Gopgram UP Chairman Alamgir Hossain for his comments over the accusations, he said, \"I was in Dhaka when the trees were felled.\""

      "text": "There was widespread shock and condemnation from the cricketing fraternity yesterday after the tragic shooting incident in Christchurch, New Zealand, where at least 49 people have lost their lives. Bangladesh's Mushfiqur Rahim and Tamim Iqbal, two of those who were witness to the incident, took to twitter to express their mental state. Other legends, like Virat Kohli, Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Akhtar joined the condemnation of such a heinous attack while breathing a sigh of relief at the safety of the Bangladesh team. Bangladesh batsman Tamim Iqbal was distraught as he was one of the players who were on their way to the Masjid AL Noor -- one of the mosques where the shooting took place. He wrote in his official twitter handle @TamimOfficial28: \"Entire team got saved from active shooters!!! Frightening experience and please keep us in your prayers.\" Wicketkeeper-batsman Mushfiqur Rahim wrote in his twitter handle @mushfiqur15: \"Alhamdulillah Allah saved us today while shooting in Christchurch in the mosque...we r extremely lucky...never want to see this things happen again....pray for us.\" Bangladesh team's performance analyst Srinivas Chandrasekaran described his experience @chinu1501: \"Just escaped active shooters!!! Heartbeats pumping badly and panic everywhere!!\" Ace all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan -- currently in Bangladesh nursing an injury which forced him to miss the New Zealand tour -- was relieved to learn that his teammates were safe. His official twitter account @Sah75official said: \"I have nothing to say about the active shooting in New Zealand that took place all I want to say is I'm grateful to almighty Allah for saving my brothers my teammates! Alhamdulillah.\" Pakistani legend Shahid Afridi spoke to Tamim over phone after the incident, enquiring about the team's safety. The popular all-rounder later posted this tweet @SAfridiOfficial: \"Horrifying tragedy #Christchurch. I found NZ one of the safest, most peaceful places, people are friendly. Spoke to Tamim big relief Bangladesh squad/staff is safe. World must together! stop hatred! Terrorism has no religion! Prayers for bereaved families. May Allah bless the departed.\" The scheduled third Test between hosts New Zealand and Bangladesh, which was scheduled to begin on Saturday in Christchurch, was cancelled after discussion between both cricket boards. International Cricket Council (ICC) praised the decision to cancel the Test. ICC CEO David Richardson was quoted in a press release: \"Our thoughts and sincere condolences go out to the families and friends of those affected by this horrendous incident in Christchurch. Both teams, staff and match officials are safe and the ICC fully supports the decision to cancel the Test match.\""

      "text": "The standard narrative of the Southeast Asia plastic crisis has a puzzling blind spot. The typical story goes that consumers and governments shoulder all the blame--consumers for using and then tossing out too much plastic, and governments for not instituting adequate waste management systems. But that narrative obviously doesn't tell the whole story. One example of this narrative: A 2015 McKinsey report that deals specifically with plastic contamination of the world's oceans points out that \"more than half of the plastic leaking into the ocean comes from just five countries: China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.\" A reader who picks up the report and thumbs through the section that poses the question \"What are the origins of ocean plastic debris?\" could be forgiven for thinking that this all of this plastic pollution is immaculately conceived in these countries. Disposable plastic is billed as a world-changing innovation and the large multinational companies that produce, market, and sell goods packaged in plastic are completely left out of the equation.  Reports like these often take for granted that these plastic products must exist and that companies bear no responsibility for their products once they've released them into global marketplaces. The lack of any accountability for corporations in studies like these is baffling. Companies flood the market with cheap plastic and give consumers no viable option but to purchase these products that are designed to be used and then immediately discarded. Many of these products, like the plastic-and-aluminum-laminated sachets that carry everything from tomato sauce to shampoo are actually impossible to recycle or reuse. Particularly in the wake of China's refusal to accept plastic waste and the winding down of the country's massive recycling operation, much of the plastic these companies produce is destined to become pollution from the very point of its creation. But an innovative type of study released last week in the Philippines wants to get away from this narrative trend. Instead, the report audits plastic waste and then goes on to actually name the corporations that are responsible for the bulk of the identifiably branded plastic waste. The Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, which produced the report with the help of tools developed by the NGO Mother Earth Foundation hopes its findings stand as a wake-up call that \"single-use, disposable plastic--not the way it is managed--is the problem.\" This report, which compiled data from 21 waste assessments carried out in six cities and seven municipalities across the Philippines, found that nearly 55 percent of the residual waste--meaning plastic that cannot be recycled--can be identified as coming from recognizable brands. The top three offending companies--Nestle, Unilever, and Procter & Gamble--created one-third of the branded non-recyclable waste.  While this report focused exclusively on the Philippines, other Southeast Asian countries would do well to carry out this type of audit, and the subsequent naming of brands that drive plastic consumption. When countries, organizations, and consumers better understand the true origin of many of these plastic products, they can be better equipped to take action. Although the task of forcing corporations to reclaim responsibility for the single-use plastic waste they generate will take a globally coordinated effort unlike any that has ever existed before.

      "headline": "Weather index-based insurance for mitigating agricultural risks in Bangladesh",
      "authors": null,
      "text": "Feisal Hussain, Team Lead, BFP-B\n Weather index-based insurance is one of BFP-B's 30 live innovation-investments in Bangladesh. We do rigorous impact assessments to see how the business models are faring. We have completed the assessment of the weather index-based insurance model and have identified the opportunities and challenges the business model presents for the insurance industry, the government of Bangladesh and other private sector actors. One of the crucial challenges is that investments in business models to support agricultural insurance is being held back, given complex and time-consuming regulatory approvals are required across multiple regulators. For example, viable business models require partnerships between insurance companies (regulated by IDRA) and channel partners such as MNOs (regulated by BTRC), MFIs (regulated by MRA), payment service providers (regulated by Bangladesh Bank), and weather data providers (regulated by the meteorological department).  Can we have a one-stop shop (OSS) for insurance companies through for instance, BIDA, where investors in agricultural insurance can secure approval for all regulatory requirements conveniently, efficiently and predictably? Farzanah Chowdhury, MD & CEO, Green Delta Insurance Company Limited\n Agriculture is one of the key driving forces of our economy. More than 72 million people are engaged in the agriculture sector. Its contribution to GDP is around 14 percent. In 2015, we started a pilot project with International Finance Corporation (IFC) to mitigate the risk of financial loss in the cultivation process, thus helping the farmers in risk coverage. IFC has helped us create historical weather data grid and Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) has also supported us by providing historical data from 1981. In 2016, we joined hands with BFP-B. We have covered more than 15,000 farmers through awareness and policies who possess 5,000 acres of land and settled claims of 3,200 farmers till date. One of our unique features is quick claim settlement with an easy and transparent process. The momentum has already been created but we need to create more awareness not only among farmers but also among seed companies, NGO/MFI, banks, input retailers and policymakers about weather-based insurance products. We need robust support from the Ministry of Agriculture, and the government should provide incentives to private organisations to invest in this critical sector. We believe that agri insurance will be the game changer in the insurance sector. We are using the satellite data to track the weather conditions of the insured areas but currently we are dependent on international weather data service provider which is very costly. If we can develop a platform where researchers, practitioners and development partners work together, we can cut down the cost of weather data procurement to one-third of the present cost.   Ali Tareque Parvez, Senior Vice President, Green Delta Insurance Company Limited\n The weather index is basically a weather parametric index with a predetermined trigger point based on historical weather data. We have historical weather data since 1981 coupled with satellite data. We analyse this data, prepare the term sheet and take up coverage collaborating with our distribution partners and finally settle the claims. It is a comprehensive business model that combines multiple channel partners to reach the marginal farmers. We customise our insurance products according to the requirements of customers, so that it is beneficial for their investments. Our system operates in a way that avoids the need for on-site damage verification on a case-by-case basis and eliminates the need to collect payout claims from farmers. We have interpolated data stations in each 10 square kilometers which inform us about the weather in specific locality. Currently, we have more than 1,477 such stations. So far, we have covered perils like droughts, unseasonal rainfall, heavy rain, cold wave, humidity, high temperature etc. We have provided insurance for various cash crops such as industrial potatoes, vegetables, hybrid rice and so on. In 2016, and 2017 we insured against heavy rainfall. According to our offer, farmers could claim payouts if the rainfall was of 16mm. During the period the rainfall was 125mm. We settled the farmers' claims fast, and it helped us gain confidence of the farmers. We arranged a programme in the presence of the then State Minister for Finance and Planning, MA Mannan and IDRA Chairman and local authorities and handed over the claims to the affected 1,000 farmers. In 2018, there was an unprecedented cold wave and we settled claims of 2,000 farmers. Through Value Added Services, enrolled farmers get a weather forecast for seven days and crop advisory in Bangla. We have also launched a toll-free number where farmers can call for any agriculture-related queries. We are trying to cover new areas and new cash crops. For that, we have partnered with distinguished stakeholders such as Info Corp, Syngenta, CARE Bangladesh; there are many more on the pipeline to broaden our service spectrum. If we get adequate support from the government, we can achieve highest coverage of weather index- based insurance products. We are also working on Flood Index Based Crop Insurance in the northern part of Bangladesh and in the haor region with the support of Ministry of Finance, IDRA & SBC. Future technology driven products such as satellite products, germination coverage, bundle with service providers etc. need to be introduced. We should also cover natural disasters such as hailstorm and flash flood. However, as Bangladesh has different weather calamities and parameters like temperature, humidity, sunshine hour, only satellite data will not work. We need to track different types of weather parameters to successfully implement agri insurance across the country.   Muhymin Chowdhury, Deputy Challenge Fund Manager, BFP-B\n We wanted to test whether there is a need for weather index-based insurance. After doing the end-line assessment, we saw that there is a strong need for such a product, and it should be replicated in the market. We have also discovered how insurance companies can partner with field-level players such as farmers' hub and agro-input retailers. Another key finding is that farmers are keen to pay for insurance if the product can address their pain points. When we piloted this project most of the heavy-lifting was done by Green Delta as there is a lack of an appropriate ecosystem to support agricultural insurance market. Due to the absence of structured crop data, Green Delta had to develop crop data through engaging farmers and the Ministry of Agriculture. Green Delta had to undertake a lot of awareness activities to promote the benefits of having weather index-based insurance. There is a willingness to deliver the value, but this willingness is restrained by the high-capital expenditure and operational cost of launching these products. One of the major cost components of launching weather index-based insurance is weather data (37 percent of the total cost of launching a product). Bangladesh Meteorological Department's infrastructure is not available across the country which limits the ability to get government-supplied data. Hence there is an increasing reliance on international weather service providers which is pushing up the cost and limiting the value of the insurance product. There is a misunderstanding about the market potential. The agricultural insurance market is twice the market size of e-commerce. If you look at the total portfolio of non-life insurance companies in Bangladesh, the agri-insurance market would be comparable to the entire sector. There is huge potential of this agri-insurance sector, and the benefit can only be achieved if we can ensure strong coordination between the insurance industry and other relevant stakeholders. There is also an absence of competition and cooperation within the insurance sector.   Shubasish Barua, Head of Product Development & Executive Vice President, Green Delta Insurance Company Limited\n India has made it mandatory for all the insurance companies to do 7 percent business through crop insurance. It has proved to be successful in promoting agri-insurance and supporting farmers. Bangladesh can learn from the example. As per insurance Act 2010 the non-life insurance companies are not allowed to have any corporate agent agreement with any corporate agent. Now if any MNO is interested to provide crop insurance, and deduct the premium from usage, they won't be able to do it as they are not the  authorised premium collector/Agent. Same is applicable for MFIs as agent.  We need to reform the law so that non-life insurance companies can get the same opportunity as life insurance companies.  Moreover, if an insurance company wants to be a content provider to an MNO, they need to have TVAS (Telecom Value Added Service) license from BTRC. An insurance company is not allowed to obtain that license. In that case, they need a fourth party to work as a TVAS content provider which will increase the cost further. IDRA may support us in increasing the insurance awareness and reaching the mass  people with crop insurance by allowing an MoU agreement between NGO/ MFI/MNOs and insurance service providers   Dr. Shameem Hassan Bhuiyan, Consultant, World Bank\n If we can build a strong weather database and necessary infrastructure, we can lower the cost. We have already established 20 weather stations in Bangladesh. But that is not enough for collecting data on the whole country. A weather station can cover only a 20 km radius. If the private sector joins hands with us, we can build a strong weather database and necessary infrastructure for the whole country. The main component for weather index based insurance is real-time location-specific data, not forecast. As per World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommendations, one Automatic Weather Station (AWS) is required for covering a 10km radius for ensuring accurate and transparent weather data. Through AWS database, every farmer can see the current weather situation. One-stop service (OSS) is a new phenomenon. It has already been established in some sectors such as Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) and Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA). The industry-promoting agencies have all opened OSS to keep pace with the current demand for OSS. Though our insurance industry is an emerging sector, it still has a long way to go. Our insurance companies have less than one percent coverage while other countries have approximately five percent coverage. Therefore, attention is required to increase the coverage in our country. The government is very accommodating and keen for the insurance sector to grow.     Md. Arafat Hussain, Challenge Fund Manager, BFP-B\n In Africa there are some AWS solutions that costs less than USD 200. In these AWSs, four or five sensors are combined in a small device. We can easily adopt this solution in Bangladesh.       Ahmed Ali, Co-founder, MARS Limited\n We provide weather data for almost all areas of the country. Our forecast accuracy level is more than 93 percent. We work with tea estates, tobacco companies and farmer communities. We have bought two AWS (tile basis) from Canada, each of which cost TK 25,000. If we set it up in Khulna, we can monitor data from our office.             AKM Iftekhar Ahmad, Consultant, Green Delta Insurance Company Limited\n The success story of crop insurance in India is due to patronisation and cooperation of the government of India. Bangladesh's crop insurance also requires the support and patronisation of the government. All the loan giving agencies including microfinance in agri sector needs to be brought under insurance. This will generate higher premium and encourage farmers to join the insurance umbrella.           M. A. Karim, Deputy Manager, Sadharan Bima Corporation\n Sadharan Bima Corporation has tested crop insurance on potato and rice in three areas. It has been found scalable and viable. Also, in the SBC project, 20 AWS (Automatic Weather Station) has been installed in two districts. It is high time for Bangladesh to scale up crop insurance, and a common platform is required for weather data support.             Md. Moneruzzaman, Head of Pricing, Banglalink\n We can support any positive initiative through our distribution system. Currently, we are working with BRAC to distribute different products in deep rural areas.             Gokul Chand Das, Member, IDRA\n The Insurance Act states that it is not possible to do insurance business in Bangladesh without obtaining license from IDRA. Many countries have policies to cover the loan book of the borrower by non-life insurance companies. We simply need to collaborate with the banks. When banks roll out their credit, insurance companies can be there to provide insurance. There are some differences in the types of crop insurance services provided by the insurance providers in our country. For instance, the finance minister directed us to have crop insurance in the low-lying haor areas of Bangladesh. But, companies such as Green Delta Insurance Company and SBC Insurance don't have experience of working in these vulnerable areas which badly require crop insurance or catastrophe insurance. If we want to expand these types of insurance throughout the country, we need to create a win-win situation for both the insurance providers and customers.         Afsana Islam, Deputy Team Leader, Growth & Private Sector Development, DFID\n The importance of agriculture is critical for our economy. We must find ways to provide funding to our farmers. Bangladesh is committed to achieving the SDGs. In this context, one of our goals is to provide people with appropriate financial services. This doesn't involve providing these services solely through banks or MFIs. We need to ensure that they don't get adversely affected by losses arising from instances like natural calamities. Though insurance is an important product, its penetration is quite low in our country. So, the question is, how can we make the insurance market more attractive to the users? And how can we ensure that we provide such services to those who need it the most? The current market requires a one-stop shop(OSS) for demand-driven solutions. I think FID can take the central authority by being the regulator or reporting body of all the regulators; they can take the driving seat to provide solutions which will benefit everyone in the market.   Ajit Kumar Paul, Additional Secretary, FID, Ministry of Finance\n There is a committee known as the co-ordination committee chaired by the central bank governor. A meeting is held on a quarterly basis with Bangladesh Bank, other banks, insurance sector, micro-credit regulatory authorities, registrars of joint stock companies and some other coordinators and regulators. The issue of OSS can be raised in the forum. IDRA has been instructed to implement agriculture insurance in the haor areas. We need to focus on supporting people suffering in haor areas due to such natural disasters and the Government is taking various steps to help them. We are also holding talks with multiple insurance companies in this regard. The government has implemented the VAT law to accommodate people. I would request the organisations present here to make recommendations as to how we can be more accommodating and can resolve the VAT issues. All the concerns will be adjusted in the upcoming budget.  "

Intercity train Lalmoni Express from Dhaka passed through the route in Gaibandha this morning, our Gaibandha correspondent reports quoting Abul Kashem, station master of Gaibandha Rail Station. The six-kilometre rail tracks stretching from Badiakhali to Trimohoni was damaged by the flood water 22 days ago, according to railway source. Additional labourers have been deployed to provide all technical support to restore rail communications on other damaged routes before Eid-ul-Azha festival, station master Kashem said. On July 17, rail tracks on 40 points along the six kilometres between Badiakhali and Trimohoni stations were damaged due to onrush of water from upstream. Following this, the railway authorities suspended the rail communication on the route. Since then, the authorities alternatively restored partial train service from Gaibandha and Bonarpara stations and Dhaka bound Lalmoni Express and Rangpur Express used Parbatipur-Santaher route as an alternative way."

      "text": "Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has asked the health minister and two mayors of Dhaka to take steps for use of effective mosquito repellent to control dengue fever, Awami League General Secretary and Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said today. \"The prime minister has asked the health minister and two mayors of Dhaka south and north city corporations to take steps to spray effective mosquito repellent to control dengue fever,\" he said after inaugurating relief distribution activities of AL's relief and social welfare sub-committee at Bangabandhu Bhaban in Dhaka's Dhanmondi. He said an awareness campaign will be launched across the country to dispel panic about dengue. Quader said flood and dengue have increased the government's work manifold as it has taken all-out preparation to face situation. The minister said AL always stands beside the people at the time of disaster and this party does not do politics with relief activities. The flood has affected people in 18 districts and AL would not only distribute relief goods but also continue to assist the affected people until completion of their rehabilitation, he added. He criticized BNP for spreading propaganda against the government's relief activities and said BNP leaders are busy with staging photo-sessions in the name of relief distribution, and spreading remours. About the BNP's threat of movement to free its chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia, Quader said she is in jail for one and a half years but BNP could not build any agitation to secure her release. \"People would no more respond to the call of BNP because people do not trust the party due to its negative politics,\" he said. About the comments of BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir that there is a crisis in the country, Obaidul Quader said, \"Actually there is crisis in BNP, not in the country\". AL joint general secretary Abdur Rahman, relief and social welfare secretary Sujit Roy Nandi, science and technology affairs secretary Abdur Sabur, information research secretary Advocate Afzal Hossain, education and human resources affairs secretary Shamsun Nahar Champa, women affairs secretary and state minister for women and children affairs Fazilatunnesa Indira and member of central working committee Mirza Azad, among others, were present at the programme.

      "text": "The flood waters of Pachil village in Sirajganj's Shahzadpur upazila have started to recede. But that does not matter to Ahed Ali. The furious Jamuna has devoured his home, even the land on which his humble abode stood.  For over a month, Ahed, along with his family of five, and other flood victims, have taken shelter on a nearby field. They all have to pay a small sum of rent to occupy that space as well. \"The water started gushing in by the first week of July. There was no scope to stay back. Now, everything has been washed away. There is no land to rebuild my home and no money to start afresh either,\" he said. Anji Khatun, of nearby Dadaspanchi village, returned from the shelter to see that her home has been damaged. She had no choice but to borrow Tk 20,000 at a high rate of interest from a local money lender to repair her home. \"My daughters and I took shelter in the flood protection embankment for three weeks. Nobody is coming forward to help us, not even the government.\" Anji was lucky that she found someone to borrow money from. But Maleka Begum of Potajia Nishipara village in the same upazila, not so much. No one is willing to lend money to her. Tying up some bamboo sticks with rope, she has repaired her home. The wind or rain can blow away the repairs at any time, she said, as she continues to live perilously. \"My husband is a poor day labourer. He had no work in the last one month. We have no place to live, no food to eat even.\" All the victims said they lost everything in the last three weeks, but they did not get any help for rehabilitation. Md Chand Ali of Potajia village said, \"During the flood, we were given seven to eight kilograms of rice as relief material.\" It was enough to last a week for a family of five. \"We are in dire need of assistance to rebuild our homes.\" Over 3,079 families of 408 villages in five upazilas of Sirajganj were displaced by the recent flood. A total of 15,434 people have been hit hard, while 313,997 people were partially affected, according to Sirajganj Relief and Rehabilitation Office. A total of 6,505 houses were entirely damaged, while 44,013 were partially damaged. \"We have reported these figures to the ministry of relief and rehabilitation. They have allotted 1,570 bundles of corrugated iron sheets to rehabilitate the flood victims. The allotment is likely to reach Sirajganj soon,\" Sirajganj Deputy Commissioner (DC) Dr Faruk Ahmed told the Daily Star recently. Not just home, roads, culverts, croplands, ponds and many educational institutions have been battered by the flood. Officials concerned at the district administration have pinned losses at Tk 200 crore this year. Total actual losses cannot be ascertained yet, as many areas are still under water. \"Although the water level was dropped below the danger level now, flooding has not left yet. There are many areas in Belkuchi, Kazipur, Chowhali and Shahzadpur that are still water logged,\" said Md Rafikul Islam, Sirajganj divisional engineer of Water Development Board. The flood water is likely to remain till the end of September, which will add to the misery of the people in these areas, he added. A total of 21,000 hectares of croplands were inundated and crops on 14,000 hectares were completely damaged, said Md Habibul Haque, deputy director of Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) in Sirajganj. He assumes the damage to agriculture to be worth Tk 134 crore. \"The agriculture sector has suffered the most due to the flood. We have submitted the flood loss report to the ministry, seeking rehabilitation funds.\" \"We are currently taking preparations for 30-acre seed beds and 56 floating seed beds in the district to assist the victim farmers after the water recedes,\" he said. Meanwhile, the district has lost eight primary schools to river erosion. There is no existence left of those institutions, said Md. Eusuf Reza, Sirajganj primary education officer. At the same time, 162 primary schools were partially damaged, he added. \"We could not calculate the total loss yet, but we are estimating it at around Tk 1.85 crore.\" All academic activities are stalled since July. \"We hope to resume studies after we complete the repair works after Eid,\" he added. Sirajganj District Educational Officer Md Shafiulla said 65 high schools and colleges have also been damaged. He expects repair work to start soon. Fish cultivation took a hit in Chalanbeel areas of Sirajganj. A total of 116.75 hectares of fishing areas were affected, washing away 110.73 tonnes of fish and 1.27 crore fish fry worth Tk 4.17 crore, said Md Shahed Ali, Sirajganj district fishery officer. \"We are expecting rehabilitation funds for the worst-hit fish farmers.\" The flood has destroyed 134 acres of hybrid grass fields. The loss can be estimated at Tk 75 lakh, said Akhteruzaman Vuia, district livestock officer. The flood claimed the lives of 4 cows and 3,885 chicken. Although the flood did not hurt the animals directly, the cattle farmers face massive losses for fodder crisis. Besides, a total of 55.34 kilometres of roads were totally damaged, while 180 km partially, said Md Mizanur Rahman, executive engineer of Sirajganj LGED. Twenty-nine culverts were also damaged. Several roads are still inundated, so the actual loss is still unknown, he said. Sirajganj is one of the biggest handloom and power loom producing areas in the country. Samen Ali of Saydabad Modhhyapara in Sirajganj Sadar upazila said, \"I set up a handloom factory by borrowing money from a local NGO a couple of years ago. But the recent flood destroyed my factory, taking away the lone source of income for my family.\" \"I don't know how I will repay the loan instalments now.\" Like him, most weavers in five upazilas are facing a crisis. Total damage to the sector is yet to be determined. As the flood water recedes, Jamuna river is devouring houses and crop lands at several points of Sirajganj Sadar, Chowhali, Shahzadpur, Kazipur and Belkuchi upazila, said Sirajganj divisional WDB engineer Rafikul Islam. This is casual river erosion, he added. \"According to the characteristics of Jamuna, the river banks erode both then the water level rises and drops. We have nothing to do at this moment. At the end of the flood, we can take steps to save damage for the next time.\" Sirajganj district administration has complied a flood loss report from different departments. But the fund allotment for rehabilitation is yet to be allotted. \"We will start rehabilitation work after getting the funds,\" DC Dr Faruk said."

      "text": "The Chattogram Development Authority has been filling up vast swaths of low-lying land, designated as water reservoirs, in the name of building residential areas. The state-run agency is building 4,533 plots at its Ananya Abasik area in Kuwaish and Panchlaish. In the 1995 Master Plan, these areas are earmarked as farmland and wetland. Filling up of farmland and wetland or changing their nature by any means is illegal. Moreover, the housing project, launched in 2011, does not have the mandatory clearance from the environment ministry, officials said. In a letter in 2018, the environment department ordered the CDA to halt the project, but the city development authority paid no heed to the call.   Ironically, however, the CDA is implementing a separate Tk 5,616 crore project to solve the port city's waterlogging problem that affects millions. Since the project's approval in 2017, the CDA has been able to do only 17 percent work. Town planners and locals say the housing projects are intensifying the problem. With thousands of residential plots occupying some 778 acres of water retention area, localities that were once known as flood-free zone now quickly go under rainwater. Oxygen Mor area is the worst affected. After last week's rain, the busy intersection remained waterlogged for at least five days. Locals said they never saw this area go under water.     Sholoshohor Gate-2, Muradpur, Probortok and Chwakbazar are among the main city thoroughfares that get waterlogged even after a light rain. Until four to five years ago, rain water would recede in couple of hours. Now, it takes up to 10 hours. In the first phase of the housing schemes, the CDA completed the work of 1,733 plots last year and is now building another 2,800 plots in the second phase. The city development authority is implementing a separate housing scheme, Kolpolok Abasik, in Bakolia, also a water reservoir.   Additionally, the CDA has approved construction of hundreds of buildings on wetland, including Bogar Beel, Chandrima Abasik, Gaochiya Abasik, over the last few years. Yeasin Mahfuz, a resident of Kuwaish, said they never had waterlogging problem in their neighbourhood in the past. \"The waterlogging problem began after the CDA completed its first phase of the Ananya Abasik project. It's sad that the CDA is aggravating the waterlogging problem while it's implementing a project to solve it,\" he said, clearly frustrated. Asik Imran, an eminent town planner and also board member of the CDA, told The Daily Star that the CDA did not do any feasibility and other relevant studies before taking up the housing projects. \"So these residential areas are intensifying the waterlogging problem in nearby areas. Such whimsical actions are essentially taking the city on the verge of destruction. The CDA can't avoid its responsibility,\" he said. CDA's Chief Town Planner Sahinul Islam Khan admitted that portions of their residential areas occupied some land earmarked as agricultural land. \"Waterlogging is sure to happen when any housing project is taken up in low-lying areas. We should have 'honoured' [spared] the water retention areas. But there is the pressure to build homes for the increasing population as well,\" he added. He would not comment on why the CDA did not take the required clearance from the environment department. But even as the city development authority's housing schemes are inundating new areas, it's project to mitigate the waterlogging problem sees little progress. After government approval in August 2017, the CDA signed an agreement with the army in April 2018 for its implementation by 2020. But with less than a quarter of the work completed, the CDA authorities are now seeking to push the deadline. Excavation of 16 out of the 36 canals have been completed while only five kilometres of retaining wall have been built out of 176 kilometres. That is the only progress. The project also include building of 12 sluice gates, renovating 500 drains, constructing five water reservoirs, 42 silt trap and 15 feet-wide roads on both side of the 36 canals. The project will also construct 48 bridges, six culverts and ten kilometres of drains. Asked about the slow pace, Project Director Ahmed Moinuddin said the consulting firm appointed to study the canals submitted their report on only 13 canals in April this year. \"It's a huge job and sometimes deadlines can be missed. The consulting firm will be able to submit their report on all the canals by August. In the meantime, we initiated a move to extend the deadline,\" he said. "

It was probably the last thing Facebook needed as it stumbles from problem to problem, including outrage over its use of customers' private data. The outage began Wednesday afternoon and triggered a flood of gripes on downdetector.com, which tracks trouble accessing online pages, and on rival Twitter. A Downdetector map late Wednesday showed Facebook service troubles persisting in parts of Australia, Asia, Europe, South America and North America. As of early yesterday the problem remained in parts of Europe and Asia, although moaning from America and else where kept coming. \"You guys should look in the mirror at yourselves and hear how you sound,\" a person with the handle Johanna wrote on Downdetector around 0745 GMT. Another whose handle is Palmina D'Allesandro mused that time without Mark Zuckerberg's baby might have been good for making the real, human kind. \"Up and running here.....for now.....But I predict a baby boom in 9 months, Remember that day FB went down and people were forced to notice each other?\", this person wrote. Some media outlets branded the outage as the biggest in Facebook's history. The outage, of unknown origin, also affected Facebook-owned Instagram, as well as Messenger, although Instagram later said it was back up. While the outage continued, The New York Times reported that US prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into the social network's practice of sharing users' data with companies without letting them know. A grand jury in New York has subpoenaed information from at least two major smartphone makers about such arrangements with Facebook, according to the Times."

On one of those days, he had read me a poem, September on Jessore Road. My then 9-year old mind was probably too absorbed in frivolous thoughts to be able to grasp the depth of the words being read. Perhaps that is why I could not help revisiting and rereading this acclaimed thought-provoking piece of work by the American poet Allen Ginsberg. Four decades have passed since the Liberation War that marked the birth of our motherland. But even today, millions of those who left as a consequence live far away from their homeland. The poem specifically provides a critical perspective on this unsung lot who are comparatively less spoken about. Ginsberg has gracefully, yet ingenuously, captured the perpetual despair and perplexities that millions of refugees had to face when they fled over by the Jessore Road as a passage to India during the War. \"Millions of Souls nineteen seventy-one\n homeless on Jessore under grey sun A million are dead, the millions who can walk toward Calcutta from East Pakistan...\" Jessore Road had always remained a crucial link between India and then East Pakistan in terms of communication and exchange but in 1971, it gained new significance. Millions of dejected individuals and families, broken and injured, all cynically affected by the War, made their way to this path which linked Jessore with West Bengal's Kolkata. \"Wet processions families walk... starving black angels in human disguise...\"\n As I gravely read on, I could imagine and relive the perilous and poignant journey. Looking ahead towards hundreds of kilometres to cross, perhaps on foot, with no money, no food, and no shelter. The only thing they held in hand was an ounce of hope for survival. I couldn't help tearing up a little as I deliberated upon the next few lines of the poem -- \"Whom shall we pray to for rice and for care?\n Who can bring bread to this s -- flood foul'd lair?\"   Their perilous escape was the least of their worries as they waited there in the face of severe starvation and horrific living conditions. International aid and relief had reached the border but several political/internal conflicts prohibited their entry. It makes you wonder how they felt then -- a tiny glistening ray of hope was right there, so close, yet so far from them.  During the War, and even today, decades later, Jessore Road still remains an important topic of war and refugee migration. Around 10 million habitants of East Pakistan had escaped to India and even today, many still remain there or somewhere across the world, far away from the place they once called home.   Almost two generations have passed since then. But even today, some monumental pieces of work such as this poem can invoke anguish in your heart for the sufferers and shake you to the core. Today, we are fortunate to be able to speak in a language we call our own, to live in a country we call our own. Yes, it is true that we have not experienced the brutality of the war first-hand. However, it is necessary for us to do our part by always honouring the heroes who fought the war and never forget those oft ignored refugees of the War who had to leave their beloved motherland behind to simply stay alive.

As part of routine road maintenance work of Roads and Highways Department (RHD) the 21 km road is repaired every year. But locals blamed low quality materials used in the repair work for the road's present condition.   Hundreds of people in Kalmakanda upazila use the road to reach Netrakona and Mymensingh, but the dilapidated condition of the road makes their journey extremely painful. Especially critical patients are the worst sufferers due to the bad condition of the road. AKM Hadisuzzaman Hadi, chairman of Borokhapon Union Parishad (UP), said the carpeting of many parts of the road wore off, resulting in several potholes. Despite the condition, people of the area are using the road as they have no alternative to reach Netrakona town, he said. In emergency cases, people of Kalmakanda use Durgapur-Jaria road as an alternative way to go to Mymensingh and due to this, they have to spend more time which made their journey very painful, said the chairman. Suruj Ali Fakir, former chairman of Roypur UP, said as the road lies in a low-lying area, it gets flooded by the onrush of hill waters from across the border. Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Zakir Hossain said the road needs immediate repair to ease people's sufferings and he has already informed the authorities concerned about the matter. Netrakona RHD Executive Engineer Md Didarul Alam said different parts of the road were washed away by flood in 2017. \"We need Tk 21 lakh for maintenance of the road every year but we do not get the required money from the department,\" said the engineer."

Villages and chars along the Teesta and Dharala rivers were hit hard by flash flood twice lately when huge amounts of fodder got damaged. As a result, farmers and small scale traders are seeing no option but to sell off their cows. In consequence, the prices have dropped sharply in all 25 cattle markets of the district. Mozibur Rahman, 55, brought three cows to sell at Durakuti Haat, one of the biggest cattle markets in the Sadar upazila, on August 6, five days before Eid-ul-Azha. He could sell only one cow at Tk 42,000 and returned home with the rest. \"I bought the cow at Tk 55,000 three months ago but now had to sell it at a loss in the same market,\" said Mozibur, a farmer of Kalmati village located on the bank of Teesta. \"I would never have sold it at such a low price if was not in a financial crisis,\" he told this correspondent. Another farmer, Nazu Miah, 50, of Bongram village said, \"Grasses and hays were largely damaged by the recent flood. The crisis of fodder has compelled us to sell cattle at low rates. \"I had nurtured four cows with an aim to earn Tk 200,000 by selling them. But I got only Tk 82,000 by selling two of them, the rest are still unsold,\" he said adding, supply of cattle was greater than demand this season. Jitish Chandra Sen of Falimari char had 19 cows. \"My two cows got washed away by flood while I have sold 10 dirt-cheap. This happened due to an acute crisis of fodder in our flood affected village,\" said the 63-year-old farmer. \"Prices have fallen sharply this year due to oversupply. The flood affected farmers are bringing their cattle but are returning with disappointment.\" Said Hazrat Ali, a trader in Durakuti Haat. Similar condition was prevailing in 25 other cattle markets in the district, he told this paper. Mizanur Rahman, 50, who came from Thana Para of Lalmonirhat town, said he purchased one cow at price lower than last year. \"From a large number of verities, I selected one and bought it at Tk 48,000,\" said the content customer. Lalmonirhat Zila Parishad Chairman Matiar Rahman was at the Haat on August 6. \"Buyers are happy to get cattle at reasonable prices but flood affected farmers and small scale traders are unhappy as they are being compelled to sell off their cows on the occasion of Eid,\" said Matiar, also general secretary of Awami League Lalmonirhat district unit.

The top brass of all the private commercial banks handed over cheques separately to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at an event at the Gono Bhaban in Dhaka on Tuesday. The banks that donated the money include Bank Asia, City Bank, IBBL, Mercantile, Mutual Trust, NCC, NRB, NRB Global, NRBC, One, Prime, Pubali, SIBL, UCB and Uttara. Of the 40 private banks, nine new banks donated Tk 25 lakh each, while the rest except ICB Islamic Bank contributed Tk 1 crore each. A devastating fire broke out at Old Dhaka's Chawkbazar on February 20, killing 70 people. Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister asked the directors of the banks to bring down the lending rate to single-digit, according to a meeting source. The directors explained that it was not possible at the moment because the private banks were facing liquidity crunch, the source said. However, the prime minister instructed the banks to take time to implement the single-digit lending rate. She, however, said banks would have to do it. Nazrul Islam Mazumder, chairman of the Bangladesh Association of Banks (BAB), a forum of the directors of the private banks, was present. On June 20 last year, Mazumder on behalf of the BAB announced that the member banks would bring down the lending rate to 9 percent and the deposit rate to 6 percent. At that time, he had said the prime minister met all the demands of the directors of the banks through an amendment to the Bank Companies Act. \"Everyone should agree to the decision to reduce the lending rates to single-digit as per the prime minister's instruction,\" he had told reporters. The promise has not been materialised yet. In April last year, banks donated Tk 163 crore to PM's relief fund. They also provided Tk 85 crore in August 2017 to support flood victims."

      "text": "The number of people in Zimbabwe affected by a devastating cyclone and flooding has jumped to 200,000, with most of the damage occurring near the Mozambique border, the UN said today. The initial estimate of those hit in Zimbabwe was 15,000 but World Food Programme (WFP) spokesman Herve Verhoosel told reporters in Geneva that the numbers had surged following an overnight assessment. Read more: Death toll exceeds 300; scores missing The situation in Zimbabwe's eastern district of Chimanimani on the Mozambique border \"is very bad,\" Verhoosel said. \"Some 90 percent of the district has been significantly damaged,\" he added. Zimbabwe's state broadcaster ZBC has also raised the death toll to 139, up from 100 on Wednesday. Five days after tropical cyclone Idai cut a swathe through Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, the full extent of the devastation is not yet clear. In hardest-hit Mozambique, an estimated 400,000 people have been displaced, according to the UN. As of now, the number of people in Mozambique affected by the storm and floods is 600,000, Verhoosel said, citing government figures. But \"that number will definitely go up,\" he told reporters. The WFP believes it is possible that a total of 1.7 million people in Mozambique will need assistance as a result of the weather-related disasters, Verhoosel added. Aid workers are racing to locate survivors, some of whom may still be stranded on rooftops or in trees. About 15,000 people still need to be rescued from floods after central Mozambique was pounded by a cyclone last week, Land and Environmental Minister Celso Correia said today. \"Yesterday we had counted 15,000 people that still need rescue today -- 15,000 people who are in bad shape. They are alive, we are communicating with them, delivering food, but we need to rescue them and take them out,\" he told reporters. He said around 3,000 people have been rescued so far since Tropical Cyclone Idai struck the flood-prone impoverished southern African country. \"The bad news is that we have lost already 217 lives,\" he said. \"There's still a lot of people on the ground in need of rescue. We are working with 120 specialists and a lot of teams to keep on rescuing.\" \"Our priority now is to make sure we take food, shelter and medicine to the people that are isolated in small islands or in big islands and villages. \"We are working 24 hours to make sure we are taking the food and medicine to those people to make sure we avoid live losses because of sickness,\" the minister said at Beira airport, which has become the humanitarian relief coordination hub. The cyclone made landfall last week in central Mozambique before hitting neighbouring Zimbabwe where at least 139 have been killed."

      "text": " As the nation observes the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the people of Pabna feel nostalgic because of his association with Nagarbari ferry terminal and 'Mujib Bandh', a flood control embankment along Padma and Jamuna rivers. Shekar Theke Shikhore, a large monument with a 26-foot-tall sculpture of Bangabandhu, was inaugurated on February 2 in 2018, on the premises of Dhobakhola Coronation High School in Bera upazila's Natiabari, six kilometres from Nagarbari ferry terminal. A brief history of Bangladesh from the battle of Polashi to the 1971 Liberation War have been depicted in plaques set beside the monument. Former lawmaker of Pabna-2 constituency Khandaker Azizul Haque Arzu contributed to making the monument. \"We demand establishing a museum here, so that locals as well as visitors from different areas can learn better about Bangabandhu,\" said freedom fighter Fazlu Master. There are also demands for taking initiative to keep alive the memory of Bangabandhu at other places associated with Bangabandhu.  On February 26 in 1972, Bangabandhu, then prime minister of independent Bangladesh, himself carried a pot of soil and put it at Bashantapur point of Nagarbari in Pabna's Bera upazila, marking inauguration of the construction of a flood protection embankment on the Padma and the Jamuna rivers. Locals named the 157.5-kilometre-long embankment 'Mujib Bandh', in fond memory of Bangabandhu. \"Once flooding by Padma and Jamuna rivers caused damage to crops in vast areas of Pabna every monsoon. Before the 1970 elections, Bangabandhu pledged to make a flood control embankment on the two mighty rivers,\" said Abdul Kader, chairman of Bera upazila parishad, also a witness of the day. After the independence in 1972, Bangabandhu inaugurated construction of the embankment at Nagarbari, himself putting soil at Bashantapur point. Inspired by Bangabandhu, locals worked together to construct the huge embankment, which helps the farmers in Pabna to get crops three times a year,\" he added. \"Nagarbari was the lone gateway of the northern districts in 60s and 70s. Bangabandhu travelled several times in Pabna and other northern districts for his political activities through Nagarbari ferry terminal. He held a rally for the historic Six-point demand in 1966 at Nagarbari ghat on his way to northern districts,\" said Md Rafique Ullah, chairman of Puran Varanga union parishad in Pabna's Bera upazila.  \"Now there is no trace of the ferry terminal as the river changed its course. Most of the people of that time also passed away,\" he said. \"Bangabandhu came to Pabna in 1948, 1952, 1954, 1964, 1966, and 1970 and addressed rallies at different places including Nagarbari, Pabna Town Hall and Ishwardi upazila to motivate people for joining movements for realising their rights,\" said Dr Anwarul Islam, pro-vice chancellor of Pabna University of Science and Technology, also a researcher on Bangabandhu. \"After independence, he visited many places in Pabna in connection with important public affairs. It is our duty to preserve Bangabandhu's memory at the institutional level for the future generation,\" he said.  "

      "headline": "China's Xi visits Myanmar to drive home Belt and Road plan",
      "authors": "\nAFP, Myitsone, Myanmar\n",
      "text": "China's President Xi Jinping arrives in Myanmar this week to nail down multi-billion-dollar infrastructure deals in a country abandoned by many in the West appalled at the \"genocide\" of Rohingya Muslims on leader Aung San Suu Kyi's watch. Xi's two-day visit, his first as president, will seek to cement Beijing's position as Myanmar's largest investor and strategic partner. The much-trumpeted China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) aims to connect the Middle Kingdom to the Indian Ocean, a key route in Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative that envisions Chinese infrastructure and influence spanning the globe. In addition to offering tens of billions of dollars in investment, China shields its neighbour at the United Nations, where pressure is mounting for accountability over the Rohingya crisis. Yet the relationship between the countries is tangled. Ethnic conflicts sizzling in border zones and the impact of dams, pipelines and transport links risk awakening hostility over Chinese intentions. For China, it is \"time to get things back on track\", historian Thant Myint-U wrote in his latest book. The headline deal will likely be a colossal factory zone and deep-sea port in Rakhine state, which lies on Myanmar's west coast beside the Bay of Bengal. Myanmar successfully slashed the cost of Kyaukphyu port from $7.2 billion to $1.3 billion, reducing the chance of it turning into a debt trap. Like other Chinese-led projects, however, public details are scant. Rakhine's northern fringes saw 740,000 Rohingya forced out in a bloody military crackdown in 2017. The state remains the stage for a civil war between the military and an ethnic Rakhine rebel group. Undeterred, Myanmar has declared the area open for business. While Western investors have shunned the opportunity, China -- competing against other regional giants -- has few such qualms. Billions of cubic metres of gas and millions of barrels of oil from offshore rigs are pumped each year across the country to China. Beijing now wants to secure plans for a high-speed rail link between the port and China's landlocked Yunnan province. Other key projects include industrial zones on the shared border and a makeover for commercial hub Yangon. Analyst Richard Horsey said the visit brings both huge opportunity and enormous risk for Myanmar. \"They feel they're again over-reliant on China and that's a very dangerous place to be.\" China already holds the largest share -- around $4 billion or 40 percent -- of Myanmar's foreign debt. The future of a suspended, Beijing-backed mega-dam in northern Kachin state threatens to overshadow Xi's visit. As vice-president in 2009, Xi signed off on the Myitsone dam with Myanmar's then-military junta. But widespread public anger brought the project to an abrupt halt two years later in an affront to China. The $3.6 billion dam would flood an area the size of Singapore and critics warn of irreparable damage to the Ayeyarwady River. Inching towards restarting the project would be \"catastrophic, counter-productive and unpopular\" ahead of Myanmar elections later this year, said Horsey. Once a vocal opponent of the dam, Suu Kyi last year called on people to reconsider their opposition. Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui last week cryptically said the two nations remained in \"close communication\" on the issue. But anger still permeates local communities. Ndau Pri, 60, who was shunted from her home 10 years ago by early construction work, still cannot return as the project has not been definitively cancelled. \"They don't care about us,\" she told AFP, gesturing to the infertile ground around her new village. The Xi visit is also to \"show support to Suu Kyi in the context of the Rohingya crisis\", analyst Yun Sun said. Suu Kyi's reputation in the West lay shattered even before she defended her nation against genocide charges at the UN's top court in The Hague last month. Luo, the Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister, focused on extolling China's role in mediating between Bangladesh and Myanmar over the Rohingya. China plays a shadowy yet influential role behind the scenes of other festering conflicts with rebel groups, particularly on the countries' shared border. The economic corridor will cut through mountainous areas of Shan state, where a dozen insurgent armies and hundreds of militia forces are based. Local media reported a Chinese envoy this week even visited key militant groups to warn them not to undermine the summit. Xi will meet both Suu Kyi and powerful army chief Min Aung Hlaing to deepen ties. From Rakhine fishermen to Kachin farmers, hearts and minds in Myanmar, however, are far from won. \"China could again become the bogeyman, seen as the existential threat to the country,\" Horsey said."

      "text": "In an exclusive session with The Daily Star, Carola van Rijnsoever, ambassador of sustainable development of the Netherlands and director of inclusive green growth under its foreign Ministry; Katja Portegies, director for safety and water of Rijkswaterstaat, the executive agency of ministry of infrastructure and water management, Netherlands; and Prof Shamsul Alam, senior secretary and member of the Planning Commission, talked about the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. Carola van Rijnsoever and Katja Portegies are now in Dhaka, to attend the Bangladesh-Netherlands intergovernmental committee meeting set to take place today. Carola van Rijnsoever said though Bangladesh is a fast-growing economy, climate change poses a risk to its development and bright future. Both The Netherlands and Bangladesh are part of the Global Commission on Adaptation, driving solutions for climate adaptation forward, she added. Katja Protegies said Netherlands has more than 200 years of experience in dealing with water and constructing the country's water-related infrastructures. Based on this experience, the Rijkswaterstaat is well-positioned to assist Bangladesh in the implementation of the BDP 2100, she said. \"A large part of our country lies below sea level; that makes us vulnerable to flooding. Protection against flooding is always vital for us,\" she said. For forty years, Rijkswaterstaat has been responsible for monitoring the quantity and quality of the water. This is a vital service for shipping, agriculture, the distribution of water in dry periods, flood protection and drinking water supply, she said.  Rijkswaterstaat monitors water level, water discharge rates, wave height and flow speed at more than 450 locations along the coast and in rivers, canals and lakes using automatic measuring equipment. These data help Rijkswaterstaat determine the measures to be taken in the event of an excess or shortfall of water, Protegeis added.   Prof Shamsul Alam talked about how Bangladesh Delta Plan will leave an impact on the people of Bangladesh.  As a result of the tremendous economic growth in the past decade, Bangladesh now faces many new challenges related to urbanisation, fresh water supply, land availability, infrastructure, energy and labor, he said.  Bangladesh, one of the largest deltas in the world,  faces many natural hazards such as salinity intrusion in coastal areas, flooding, riverbank erosion and cyclones as an effect of climate change, Alam added.   \"The Netherlands has advanced expertise in the fields of delta technology, water technology and maritime technology. Bangladesh also have acquired broad knowledge and experience on integrated water resources and land use management,\" he said. In 2012, the governments of Bangladesh and The Netherlands signed a Memorandum of Understanding, recognising the importance of developing an overarching \"Delta Plan\" for a safe, sustainable and prosperous socio-economic delta development. The government has developed a long-term BDP2100 to cope with these climate challenges and move the country forward for the next 100 years, he said, adding that it includes major policies, priority investment programmes and institutional reforms to address climate change risks by improved polder management and flood control programmes. BDP2100 aims to contribute to achieving an upper middle-income status and eliminating extreme poverty, Prof Alam said. When asked what kind of help Netherlands is providing to Bangladesh to implement DBP2100, he said although the socio-economic context in the Netherlands is different from Bangladesh, the two countries are facing very similar climate change trends. Carola van Rijnsoever added, \"I want to emphasise that this cooperation is truly beneficial to both countries. The national experts in Bangladesh have a deep understanding of water-related issues.

      "text": "A pregnant nurse has died after contracting the coronavirus but her baby, a girl, was delivered successfully and is doing well, the British hospital where she worked said on Wednesday. Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong, 28, who had worked as a nurse on a general ward at Luton and Dunstable University Hospital, to the north of London, died on Sunday. It was not clear if the baby had tested positive for the disease. The Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said that Ms Agyapong tested positive on April 5 and was admitted to the hospital she worked at on April 7. \"It is with great sadness that I can confirm the death of one of our nurses, Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong, who passed away on Sunday,\" said David Carter, chief executive of the trust. \"Mary worked here for five years and was a highly valued and loved member of our team, a fantastic nurse and a great example of what we stand for in this trust. \"Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with Mary's family and friends at this sad time.\" The announcement of the death comes amid an ongoing row over the lack of protective equipment provided for frontline healthcare staff in the UK during the crisis. Meanwhile it was announced that Connie Titchen, 106, was believed to be the oldest person in Britain to overcome the virus. Doctors at City Hospital in Birmingham, in central England, said she had fought off the virus after being ill for around three weeks. And a 99-year-old army veteran on Wednesday, was said to have raised more than PS8 million (9 million euros, US$10 million) for the NHS. Tom Moore had aimed to raise PS1,000 by completing 100 laps of his garden but saw donations flood in after news of his quest spread. His fundraising was recognised by Health Minister Matt Hancock, who said at Wednesday's Downing Street press briefing: \"Captain Tom, you're an inspiration to us all and we thank you.\""

      "text": "Defying the government's request to stay home to stem the spread of  coronavirus, Sharif Hossain left his house in Sonargaon before the crack of dawn last Friday. In a shopping bag, he carried three Jamdani sarees made by him and his fellow weavers two weeks prior to the shutdown, enforced since March 26.  His destination was the wholesale market of Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) Jamdani palli at Rupganj in Narayanganj. Though Sharif knew that the market was closed, he wanted to try his luck. He was desperate to sell the sarees to earn something for the coming weeks and pay wages to his three weavers and three helpers.  For a Friday morning, the otherwise bustling marketplace was starkly deserted, with hardly any buyers. Only a couple of children were playing cricket, a group of four were chit-chatting under a shed and a person was selling masks and alcoholic hand rubs. \"Any other Fridays, I would bring three or four sarees and all would be sold in about only 10 to 15 minutes. But today, I have brought three sarees and sold only one in three and half hours, since I arrived here at 6:00am,\" Sharif said in a dismal tone.  The saree was sold only at half the normal price, he told this correspondent at the wholesale market around 9:30 am on April 3.   \"If the crisis centring coronavirus lingers and we cannot work, we will be forced to beg on the street,\" said Sharif.  His concern was echoed by at least 10 other weavers at the wholesale market. The coronavirus outbreak has bruised almost all businesses, but jamdani weavers are among the hardest hit. They claimed there are about 7,000 to 10,000 weavers in and around the BSCIC Jamdani industrial zone, which alone has 2,190 weavers and helpers working in about 274 plots. Each plot has an average of four handlooms. Normally every Friday, the wholesale market, commonly called the Jamdani haat, comes alive with a frenzy of activities as buyers from all over the country arrive at the place at dawn. The weavers said the weeks before Pohela Boishakh and Eid-ul-Fitr are the peak season for Jamdani sales, as demand for the exquisite clothing goes up on occasion of these festivals.  The marketplace, usually, sees sales of Tk 70 lakh to Tk 80 lakh on each haat day. However, sales of Jamdani sometimes exceed Tk one crore on the Fridays before Eid-ul-Fitr and Pohela Boishakh, according to BSCIC officials. Though the Bangla New Year \"Pahela Baishakh\" is only two weeks away, there were no signs of any buyers in the market. \"As the market is closed, buyers from outside the area are not here. Thus, weavers now have to sell their products at half price,\" said Anwar Hossain, member of ward no 7 of Tarabo municipality, where the Jamdani industrial area is located. The weavers, except for a few, were compelled to shut down all handlooms, said Muslem Uddin Musa, another Jamdani weaver of the area.  \"I am contacting the buyers. They tell me to wait till the normalcy returns. But this was our best time for business,\" he added. The nationally and internationally acclaimed Jamdani is a type of muslin, characterised by its geometric or floral designs. It was inscribed on Unesco's Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2013. The time-consuming and labour-intensive Jamdani weaving process often takes 15 days to a month, starting from tying and dyeing the threads, drawing the designs and finally weaving the saree in hand-operated looms with foot pedals. \"Even in February, we were toiling day and night with high hopes of good business during Pohela Boishakh in April and Eid-ul-Fitr in May, two of the largest festivals,\" said Jamdani weaver Azizul Islam. The third generation handloom owner said he can produce eight to 10 Jamdani sarees in a month using his eight handlooms. \"Man proposes, God disposes,\" Azizul muttered, adding that the 'monster coronavirus' is eating away their business. The 45-year-old weaver said they have never faced such a situation before. During the flood of 1988 and 1998, these craftsmen had to move their handlooms elsewhere but production was not badly hampered.  \"But this time, the crisis is unimaginable,\" he said. Weavers noted the urgency to sell sarees as soon as possible. Jamdani sarees cannot be stocked because they lose shine and quality in damp weather conditions, they explained.  They urged the authorities to stand by the weavers who are relentlessly working to keep the traditional art of Jamdani alive.  BSCIC Jamdani industrial zone accountant Abdul Awal said no one has contacted them for assistance so far.  He said they informed the head office that potential loss from March 26 to April 26  during the current coronavirus related shutdown will be around Tk 5.58 crore. \"The potential loss was calculated taking account of production and operation cost of Jamdani handlooms at the BSCIC Jamdani industrial zone,\" he said. \"Weavers are passing hard times due to coronavirus and heading towards a bleak future. But I think authorities would devise a plan for them as they are taking information of possible losses,\" he said.  \"If the coronavirus situation lingers, loss to the weavers will increase manifold,\" Awal predicts."

China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, India and many if the 187 countries affected have imposed strict conditions and curtailed entry into their borders. These limitations are creating serious supply-chain disruptions, production delays and distribution slowdowns, resulting in major impediments for many businesses that depend on international supplies. Industries such as travel, hospitality, healthcare and education are facing extreme difficulties in this turmoil. Most businesses in Bangladesh and beyond are complaining of serious consequential disruptions and, as a result, speculating reduced revenue and possible losses. As it is still unclear exactly how much disruption this pandemic will be causing, the businesses are unable to foresee the total impact. The unforeseen coronavirus crisis has been causing an inevitable and maybe a necessary market correction. Although if anything is obvious in business, it is that there will always be threats and upheavals for the CxOs to grapple with. Some of these threats are within the organizations, and some are external or superficial. The coronavirus crisis is just the newest such case in point. The successful leaders are the ones who can be the most aware and prepared as possible. A major learning from this ongoing crisis, is the significance of the supply-chain system, and to keep fallback plans for not jeopardizing it as much as possible. If the risks associated with using a supplier from a specific country or region are higher than justifiable levels, businesses should be prepared to use other sources where the risks are lower. Multi-sourcing in supply-chain is essential to make sure that if one source becomes precarious or uncertain, there are alternatives whose risks have been pre-assessed. Finance and risk management mechanisms can enable businesses to make informed and strategic decisions about identifying stable and resilient supply-chains. Supply-chains play a vital role in a company's ability to absorb shocks in turbulent times.  The 'FM Global Resilience Index 2019' is a great reference tool for the CxOs across businesses for making more conscious key decisions when it comes to the resiliency of their companies. The index ranks countries on various economic, risk-grades and supply-chain related standards. The CxOs can refer to the index and comprehend the effects of local and global factors on a country's resilience to crises. It highlights that vital manufacturing sources in Asia - Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, are ranked equally at no.112 for natural calamity. Vietnam ranked last (at no.130) for natural hazard risk-grade, because of their substandard state and implementation of building-codes to address natural disasters. CxOs can also determine the risks to natural calamities by referring to several technology-based tools available in the market that provide a global view of tolerable and high-risk flood areas. It can provide businesses with advance information they need to choose sources for their supply-chains. These tools can help businesses to devise two-to-five-year long plans based on risk-grades that include natural calamities and other pertinent standards, such as corporate governance. The coronavirus crisis has already exposed the vulnerabilities of many businesses, especially those who source their raw materials or finished products from China. Any extensive interruption in the \"world's factory\" means putting supply-chains at risk worldwide. Most of the Fortune Global 500 companies source their products from China. Those companies whose supply-chain relies on direct or secondary suppliers in China will experience major impediments. Apple recently shifted its manufacturing contracts to India, moving out of China to avoid the fallout of the ongoing trade-war with the US. It may pay dividends as the continuing coronavirus crisis would have forced Apple to look for alternatives anyway. Bangladesh should grab this opportunity to become an alternative source taking full advantage of the backlashes China is facing worldwide because of being the origin of the coronavirus. Bangladeshi businesses should also learn from this outbreak and start looking for alternative sources for its imports. The Covid-19 outbreak has led to shutdowns, resulting in stoppage of production in the supply-chain system. Logistics companies can no longer transport goods without interruptions, especially across borders. Pundits have repeatedly said that obtaining more visibility across the supply-chain is crucial for the success of businesses. Companies that sell finished products usually are aware of the manufacturing and shipping schedules of their direct suppliers, but they have little to no knowledge of suppliers further up the chain. Gaining this visibility is important for an efficient and deft supply-chain. During precarious situations, this visibility becomes vital for estimating and realizing the effect of the disruption on the rest of the chain, so that others in the business ecosystem can think of alternatives and act accordingly, such as planning ways for substitute suppliers. Digitising records will make supply-chains more resilient to future shocks. Digitising provides visibility and reduces risks. It is vital to make information available digitally to reduce the impact of points-of-failure in a supply-chain model. In the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, businesses with strong digital infrastructure are dealing with the supply-chain disruptions much better than those without. Blockchain technology can help ensure data privacy for suppliers. Traditional centralized supply-chain models cannot grant independent and auditable access controls to each party. Using blockchain, which is a decentralized system, is the best way to give suppliers the privacy they need and buyers the visibility they want. When created properly, suppliers can audit their data-sharing permissions directly on their own blockchain node. Concurrently, their data can be securely distributed to others in the blockchain network without requiring the point-to-point integration that centralized systems do. The Covid-19 pandemic should be a lesson well learned for all businesses whether or not that have been unfavourably affected by it. Apart from underscoring the significance of diversifying supply-chain and assessing risks, it shows the benefit of regularly gauging backup plans to be prepared for and to lessen damage from unanticipated events. Companies with plausible Business Continuity Plans (BCP) will do better than those companies that are under-prepared for crises and hindrances. While there is no prescribed user-manual for what should happen in cases of emergencies, it is essential that all businesses make plans beforehand for situations like the current times. While pandemics may not be a regular event, unforeseen disruptions to supply-chain systems are not. It is in a company's best interest to make sure that there is a contingency plan well-prepared in advance.

      "text": "Amid the coronavirus scare and threat of impending flash flood, farmers in the haor region of Sylhet Division are expecting a bumper Boro harvest this time. Many of the farmers, who have been busy harvesting Boro paddy over the last one week, said they were happy with the market prices for their produce. They, however, said a shortage of farm labourers made it difficult for them to harvest Boro, the main crop in the region. According to the Department of Agriculture Extension, Boro has been cultivated on 447,195 hectares of land in Sylhet Division with a production target of 23.71 lakh tonnes. Srinibash Debnath, additional director of the department in Sylhet, said, \"This year, the harvest seems very good. No disease hit the paddy. We are expecting a very good yield.\" Till yesterday, 31 percent of the produce was harvested in the haor areas against 21 percent in the whole division, he mentioned, adding that the progress was satisfactory. The official, however, voiced worry that flash flood may hit the region any time. According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre of Bangladesh Water Development Board, flash flood may hit the haor region at the end of the week due to excessive rainfall in the north-eastern part of the country and in the Indian states of Assam and Meghalaya. Shyamal Sarkar, a farmer of Bagbari village of Dharmapasha upazila in Sunamganj, said, \"The weather is still favourable and the Khurma river is flowing below the danger mark. We hope to finish harvest before the flash flood hits the area.\" Upesh Sutradhar, a marginal farmer of Mahdi village in Chhatak upazila, said he had already harvested paddy on one acre of his three-acre land and was happy with the produce. \"I have already harvested around 30 maunds of paddy and sold those for Tk 650 a maund. I am happy with the harvest and the price,\" he said. Last year farmers sold Boro paddy for around Tk 400 a maund. This time, farmers are happy with the prices ranging from Tk 650 to Tk 750 per maund. Many of them said they were facing a shortage of farm labourers. But thankfully, idle labourers of different sectors joined them to harvest paddy. Tamij Uddin is one such labourer from Moulvibazar's Kulaura upazila. He along with his brother is now harvesting paddy in Hakaluki Haor area. Ekhlasur Rahman, a labourer of Chanpur village in Chhatak upazila, said, \"There is a bit of crisis of farm labourers, but the wages of labourers have not gone up that much\". However, Abdur Razzak, a farmer from Dugnoi village in Dharmapasha upazila, said, \"A farm labourer is now charging Tk 700 a day. The amount usually hovers around Tk 500. \"The virus scare and a lack of transport are deterring labourers of other districts from coming here,\" he mentioned. Another Farmer, Shyamal Sarkar, in the same upazila, said, \"There are different ways to pay a labourer. Some labourers take one of every seven sacks of paddy they harvest, while some charge Tk 1,800 to 2,000 per kiyar (37 decimals).\"  "

It was founded by Faysal Khalilur Rahman, the current Assistant Director at Public Relations and Publications, Sylhet Agricultural University, Bangladesh. Their team, known as the 'Kaaktaduas', was awarded the Joy Bangla Youth Award by the Centre for Research and Information (CRI) in 2017. Bangla films as a tool to raise social awareness Using cinema as a medium to communicate social messages, the Kaaktaduas have made 16 short films so far. These include: Oishee, Bhua Doctor, Ghew, Jinn Er Baadshah, Proshno, Shei Meyeta, Foll Shommelon, Way to Success, Tution, Sesh Bikele, Prioshchitto, Arshee, Adharer Nilima, Two Face, Kingkottobobimur, Alo Adharer Golpo and Bondhu Manr Aaina. \"Cinema is one of the most preferred forms of entertainment for most people. Our films carry different social messages,\" shares Faysal. Their recent production, Shoirachaar, was released earlier this year. Pledging to preserve our language 'Bangla' \n Language is an asset and so is the environment. Bearing that in mind, the Kaaktadua volunteers started their 'Banan Shuddi' campaign in February 2014, with an aim to rectify the practice of using incorrect Bangla spellings on billboards, wall posters and signboards. \"Being the only country who has fought for their mother language, I believe we should know and practice the correct form of Bangla,\" asserts Faysal. \"Alongside correcting Bangla spellings, we provided various counselling and academic sessions to shop keepers, poster writers, and wall painters, in order raise awareness in this regard.\" Music as a weapon to fight the aftermath of natural calamities Since the past couple of years, volunteers of the organisation have been using music as a way to collect funds and donate necessary resources to victims of natural disasters. \"In 2018, there was a hazardous flood in Shunamganj, Haor. Our members came up with the idea to use music as a way of collecting funds, instead of just going around asking for money. Members who are good singers pair up and walk along the city street, holding a box labeled with the cause for fund collection.\" The Kaaktaduas collected BDT 80,000 and donated the full amount to the flood victims of Haor. Empowering the underprivileged with filmmaking skills  With the motto, 'Shobar Jonno Cholochitro', the Kaaktadua family also provides lessons on filmmaking to underprivileged children. \"Last year in February, we hosted our first free workshop on photography and basics of filmmaking in SOS Shishu Polli, Doyamir. The session was conducted by our member, Kaniz Ahmed, with the support of Md Yusuf Ali, the Director of SOS Shishu Polli. Since then, it has been one of our regular activities,\" mentions Faysal. Kaaktadua also organises various photography exhibitions and film screenings. Through their initiatives, the organisation plans to improve the living standards for the underprivileged in enjoyable and socially acceptable ways."

      "text": "The government is considering shelving its plan to shift one lakh Rohingyas to remote Bhashan Char following persistent objections from international aid agencies to the relocation. \"We are seriously thinking of shelving the relocation plan because the international organisations have not agreed to it,\" Md Enamur Rahman, state minister for disaster management and relief, told The Daily Star on Wednesday. Without cooperation from those organisations, the government would face difficulties in arranging food, healthcare and other necessary items for one lakh people on Bhashan Char, he said. UN and aid agencies say the island is isolated, flood-prone and would be hazardous for the Rohingyas because of cyclones and tidal surges. The government has already built 120 cluster villages on the 40sqkm island under a Tk 2,312 crore housing project for accommodating one lakh of the nearly 1 million Rohingyas sheltered in cramped camps in Cox's Bazar. Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen, Enamur and officials concerned visited the project site on the island, in Noakhali's Hatiya upazila, around 37 miles off the coast of Bay of Bengal, on February 13. Meanwhile, Momen on Sunday said if the Rohingyas were shifted to Bhashan Char, they might not agree to leave the place in future. \"We want the Rohingyas to go back to Rakhine. We want to repatriate them. That's our priority,\" he told reporters at his ministry office. The housing project, funded with public money, was taken after some 750,000 Rohingyas fled a brutal military campaign in Myanmar's Rakhine and took shelter in Cox's Bazar since August 2017. They joined some 300,000 other Rohingyas, who had fled previous waves of violence in Rakhine. Disaster management ministry officials said destruction of forest and hills and risk of landslides in Cox's Bazar prompted the authorities to choose the temporary housing site on Bhashan Char. They said the project implemented by Bangladesh Navy has 120 cluster villages that are capable of accommodating one lakh Rohingyas. The houses have been built four feet above the ground with concrete blocks. The entire housing site is protected by a 13-km-long flood embankment. There are also 120 cyclone shelters, which are planned to be used as schools, medical centres and community centres. The officials also said there are large swathes of land that could be used for livestock and fish farming if the Rohingyas were relocated there. The refugees in the Cox's Bazar camps have a very little work to do now. UN and several international aid agencies have been opposing the relocation plan from the beginning. Human Rights Watch too said the island is not sustainable for human habitation and could be seriously affected by rising sea levels and storm surges. In October last year, Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner (RRRC) Mahbub Alam Talukder said some 6,000 to 7,000 refugees had expressed their willingness to be relocated to Bhashan Char. UN agencies then decided to send a technical mission to the island. They intended to look at the risks of natural disasters, water supply, access to basic services, including health and education, and the freedom of movement within Bhashan Char and to and from the mainland, a UN official said. Later, the government set a condition that there should be terms of reference for the UN technical mission. Since then, there has been no visible progress on the matter. Now, ministers and officials concerned say they are considering not to relocate the Rohingyas to Bhashan Char and that they are thinking of an alternative plan. Requesting anonymity, an official said different relevant ministries reached an informal agreement on shelving the plan to relocate the Rohingyas to the remote island, but the final decision would be taken by the Prime Minister's Office. \"Bangladesh earned so much praises for sheltering the Rohingyas. It should not have a bad reputation now by executing the relocation plan, going against the will of the Rohingyas and the international aid agencies,\" the official said. Asked about the future of the housing project if the government changes the relocation plan, Foreign Minister Momen said they were yet to decide on it. He, however, thinks homeless people from other parts of the country could be accommodated on the island. The government maintains the island is safe for human habitation. Bhashan Char is only 25 kilometres from Sandwip, another island in Chattogram, he said, adding, \"With the fast siltation rate, Sandwip and Bhashan Char can get connected in the near future. Eventually, we will have a huge landmass. We can do a lot of things.\""

      "text": "Despite a court directive to stop the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics, the health authorities have taken no concrete steps in this regard, raising the spectre of superbugs, which cause some seven lakh deaths globally per year. Sale of antibiotics without requiring prescription from registered physicians is still high in the country, The Daily Star has found visiting over two hundred drug stores and talking to experts. Bacteria-fighting drugs known as antibiotics help control and destroy many of the harmful organisms that make people sick. But overuse and misuse of antibiotics prompt some strains of bacteria to make a small change in their DNA and become antibiotic-resistant \"superbugs\", experts say.  There is no data on deaths caused by superbugs in Bangladesh, but professors at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) say about 70 percent of the deaths at ICUs are caused by AMR [antimicrobial resistance] infections. AMR is a situation when microorganisms like bacteria, virus and some parasites resist medicinal interventions. \"Problem is people don't know which drugs are antibiotics. Around 15 lakh people are taking antibiotics daily and most of them don't have prescriptions,\" Prof Sayedur Rahman, chairman of pharmacology department at the BSMMU, told The Daily Star. A recent study, carried out jointly by the Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA) and the WHO, shows that antibiotics consumption in Bangladesh has increased by 30.81 percent in the last two years. The DGDA and the WHO used data from the pharmaceutical companies, and the study report was released on November 27 last year. Earlier on April 25, the High Court ordered the DGDA to take steps to stop the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics.  The ruling came after a writ petition was filed by Advocate Sayedul Haque Suman over the matter. The writ was spurred by a report in UK's The Telegraph, which cited a report this newspaper ran under the headline \"A big cause for health concern\" in April last year. High-ups of the DGDA -- the apex regulatory body for pharmaceuticals -- claimed they had done their best. But in reality, they only issued a notice in May to all district commissioners and civil surgeons, asking them to take steps in line with the court directive. The notice was followed-up by a reminder a month later. That was the extent to which the DGDA acted. DGDA Director Ruhul Amin told The Daily Star, \"Our drug inspectors are regularly advocating this issue at meetings with stakeholders.\" Queried further, he again mentioned that \"awareness was all important\" in this regard. People concerned, however, said the DGDA's action was \"just to save its skin\". Meanwhile, a laboratory analysis by the Department of Microbiology and Immunology (DMI) of BSMMU, conducted from 2010 to 2018, has found a sharp rise in the number of superbugs in the country. In 2010, superbugs and multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria were detected in 6.5 percent cases of all patients seen. But it increased to 11-14 percent in 2018, according to the study. Experts said it is the inappropriate and overuse of antibiotics which leads to the rise of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria or superbugs, The AMR infections have become a global threat, with 10 million deaths predicted to be caused by it by 2050 if things go unchecked, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). But the country's authorities concerned seem to be taking the matter lightly. GROUND REALITY: PROFIT OVER PRESCRIPTION\n Recently, The Daily Star correspondents have visited drug stores in Farmgate, in front of Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) and Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital in the capital. They have also been to pharmaceutical stores in both urban and rural areas in Savar, Rangpur, Khulna, Sylhet, Chattogram, Mymensingh and Rajshahi. The scenario was similar everywhere. At half a dozen drug stores at a rural market in Rangpur's Pirgachha upazila, this correspondent last month found antibiotics being sold either without prescriptions or as suggested by medicine sellers. \"As antibiotics work better and are more profitable, we sometimes do suggest it. People usually don't buy full dose of antibiotics. Besides, they are also reluctant to visit doctors because it would cost them additional money,\" a medicine shop owner in the village market told The Daily Star. Visiting at least 25 stores in Khulna's Hazrat Market, Moilapota intersection, Natun Rasta intersection and in front of Khulna Medical College Hospital, The Daily Star correspondents found customers buying antibiotic drugs without any prescription. Jalal Ahmed, owner of Afroz Medical Hall at Moilapota intersection, said he was not aware of any formal instruction from the authorities on not selling the drugs without prescription. There are more than a hundred pharmaceutical stores on the Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital Road. A medicine seller there said they make a huge profit from antibiotics sale. \"We have not got any direction in this regard,\" he said. The Daily Star correspondents witnessed the same situation in Chowhatta and Amberkhana areas in the city. Our Mymensingh correspondent and Rajshahi University correspondents also found antibiotics being sold over the counter in the two districts. Usually people suffering from dysentery, diarrhoea, food poisoning, common cold, cough, fever, toothache, and ear and throat pain use self-prescribed antibiotic, shows a 2014 study conducted in Rajshahi and published in the journal of the National Centre for Biotechnology Information. According to the DGDA website, there are 118,901 licensed retail drug shops across the country. A 2015 study by the System for Improved Access to Pharmaceuticals and Services, however, revealed the existence of approximately an equal number of unlicensed retail drug stores in the country, shows WHO website. A majority (68 percent) of the clients visiting these drug shops came by self-referral and without a prescription, the study showed. For another study, the Institute of Epidemiology, Diseases Control and Research (IEDCR) analysed some 14,669 samples collected from nine public hospitals across the country from 2017 and 2019. It found Ceftriaxone, a watch group drug, to be the most used antibiotics, and that the drug's effectiveness has gone down by 10 to 92 percent in killing several bacteria. According to the WHO, antibiotics are classified into three groups -- \"access group\" used for a wide range of primary level infection, \"watch group\" used against higher resistance bacteria, and \"reserve group\" only to be used when all alternatives fail. Imipenam, another watch group drug, has been found to be 10 to 76 percent ineffective. If these don't work, it only leaves to a few other antibiotics. \"It indicates we are rapidly going to exhaust rest of the available antibiotics in our hand,\" said Dr Zakir Hossain Habib, principal scientific officer at the IEDCR, who led the study. DGDA INITIATIVES -- NOT ENOUGH? On the DGDA directive on stopping the sale of antibiotics without prescriptions, several deputy commissioners said the DGDA initiative had a very little to no impact on creating awareness on the matter. \"We have held a meeting with all stakeholders. However, we haven't conducted any mobile court drive yet,\" Md Asib Ahsan, DC of Rangpur, told The Daily Star, adding that they were focusing on raising awareness first. He also said the issue deserves more campaigning and the DGDA needs to do more planning. Asked, DGDA Director Ruhul Amin couldn't even say whether the sale and consumption of antibiotics without prescription was a punishable offence. A DGDA official, however, said any medicine seller could be punished under the existing law for selling antibiotics without proper prescription. Such punishment, however, has yet to be meted out. BSMMU's Prof Sayedur Rahman said the DGDA can impose a fine of up to Tk 40,000 for the offence. He said cases can be filed against the owner of the drug store and it also can be sealed off. Contacted, Health Minister Zahid Malek apparently defended the DGDA, saying, \"It has a shortage of manpower. It is tough for them to monitor drug stores across the country.\" The DGDA has only 46 drug superintendents in its 54 district offices, said its sources. COORDINATION IS THE KEY Experts says the sale of antibiotics over the counter continues unabated mainly due to a lack of monitoring from the DGDA and coordination between the drug administration and the local administration. \"There are around 200 staffers, including 20 doctors, under the health ministry at each upazila. They can easily be involved in raising awareness on AMR [antimicrobial resistance],\" Prof Sayedur Rahman, who led the antibiotic DGDA-WHO antibiotic consumption study, told The Daily Star, adding that the DGDA cannot sit idly for the recruitment of manpower. He also said physicians often unnecessarily prescribe antibiotics \"due to a lack of facilities to carry out antibiotic sensitivity [ABS] test. Doctors in 55 districts do not have ABS test facility, he said. Dr Zakir Hossain Habib, principal scientific officer at the IEDCR, however, said the required tests could be done manually with the existing facilities as an alternative to the ABS tests. For that, the government must appoint enough lab technicians and ensure sufficient supply of reagents. Dr Muniruddin Ahmed, professor of clinical pharmacy and pharmacology at Dhaka University, suggested involvement of all local bodies in the fight against over-the-counter sale of antibiotics. He wants the DGDA to take the lead. Prof Sayedur Rahman suggested marking boxes of antibiotics red so that people can easily know they are prescription drugs.

Bangladesh's GDP stood at Tk 2,536,177 crore in 2018-19. The allocation was raised following an assessment of the plan taken in September 2018 with the view to ensuring food and water security and fight disasters. Under the plan, coastal, varendra (barind), drought- and flood-prone areas along with haor, Chittagong Hill Tracts, riverine and urban areas will get priority. The planning ministry organised a discussion on the Delta Plan yesterday at the NEC auditorium in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, where an integrated assessment of the plan was presented. The $4.02 billion Integrated Jamuna-Padma Rivers Stabilisation and Land Reclamation project is one of the major ones taken under the plan, said Shamsul Alam, a member of the General Economics Division, adding that the World Bank has already showed interest in providing $2 billion for the project. Another $5.28 billion project titled 'Construction of Padma Barrage and Ancillary Works' has been added to the list. The project will be implemented after Bangladesh sits and discusses with the country where the river originates from, Alam said, adding that the GDP will grow at 1.5 percent every year if the plan is implemented.  If not implemented, the government will fail to reach its target to bring down the poverty level to zero by 2027, he said. The Delta Plan is an umbrella plan, so it is not necessary that all projects in it would be implemented, said Planning Minister MA Mannan. \"We can add or deduct new projects under the plan also,\" he said, adding that the government will take projects under its annual development programme on the basis of the Delta Plan. The Delta Plan should be monitored continuously by the local experts and changes should be brought if necessary, said Jamilur Reza Choudhury, vice-chancellor of the University of Asia Pacific. Foreign experts would be hired if the local ones cannot do the job, he said. He showed an example of the Padma Multipurpose Bridge where local engineers are responsible for overall management. The planning minister seconded Reza's call to give the monitoring job to local experts. Climate change may cut production of paddy and wheat by 17 percent and 61 percent respectively, according to planning ministry's estimates. About 70 percent of the land in 16 districts, where the poverty rates are rather high, are the most vulnerable to natural disasters, it added."

      "text": "Already downgraded to Category 4, Cyclone Amphan could weaken further by the time it makes landfall close to the western Sundarbans, experts said yesterday. They, however, expressed concern that it might still wreak serious havoc on Bangladesh as a storm surge, depending on the tide. Md Shah Alam, former director of Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD), said the wind speed of the cyclone would certainly be less at landfall than at the sea. He said the storm surge would depend on when the cyclone makes landfall -- during high tide or low tide. Another point of concern was that the cyclone still continued to cover a large swathe of the funnel-like Bay, pushing waters northwards, which would only worsen the storm surge around the time it hits, Shah Alam added. Quamrul Hasan, the BMD forecast officer on duty, said the main feature of this cyclone is its speed, sea surface temperature and radius. Experts said Amphan is only the second super cyclone formed over the Bay of Bengal after the 1999 Oddissa cyclone. This is the first super cyclone over the Bay in this century. The Joint Typhoon Warning Centre said sustained wind speed of Amphan would be just below 160 km per hour at landfall, which would further weaken the cyclone to Category 3. Earlier yesterday, the cyclone was rated Category 5. According to Indian Meteorological Department, 46 severe cyclonic storms were registered in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea from 1965 to 2017. In terms of fatalities, Bangladesh was hit by seven of the worst cyclones recorded in history, with the Bhola Cyclone killing between 3 to 5 lakh people in 1970. The cyclone had brought a a 20-feet storm surge. \"The most serious threat posed by Amphan is its potentially catastrophic storm surge. Even if Amphan's top winds weaken, the storm surge threat will remain dire,\" said Weather Underground, a commercial weather forecast organisation. Prof Mahbuba Nasreen, director of Dhaka University Institute of Disaster Management and Vulnerability Studies, said cyclone Amphan is different because of its nature. \"It is stronger than Sidr and Ayla. People are terrified of the novel coronavirus pandemic and this cyclone would be a double blow to them,\" she said. Mohan Kumar Das, a fellow at the Institute of Water and Flood Management of BUET, said the surface temperature is very high and sustained wind speed remains high too. \"Cyclone Amphan had turned to Category 5 from Category 1 within just 18 hours,\" he said about the uniqueness of the cyclone.

Md Junab Ali, chairman of Sharifpur union parishad (UP), said they submitted a complaint to the deputy commissioner of Moulvibazar demanding immediate steps to stop illegal sand lifting from the bridge area. \"If the callous act is not prevented, Manu Bridge will face threat, especially during the monsoon, when the water level sees an alarming rise. \"Once the bridge becomes unusable, import and export from and to India through Chatlapur land port will stop, causing trouble for a large number of people on both sides,\" he said. Abdul Malik, former president of Shamshernagar Banik Samity, said he along with former local UP member Nashibur Rahman Nashim and Noor Ahmed Chowdhury Bulbul took the lease for sand lifting from the river area for 2019-2020 fiscal year. Asked whether the deal allows them to lift sand from near the bridge, he declined to make any comment. According to the Balu Mohal O Mati Babosthapona Ain, 2010 (Sand Fields and Soil Management Act, 2010), sand lifting is not allowed within 500 metres of any bridge area, said Abdul Karim Kim, executive member of Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon. But the syndicate of influential traders having political connections continued lifting sand near the bridge with powerful dredgers, he said. Asked about the matter, Kulaura Upazila Assistant Commissioner (Land) Nazratun Naim said, \"I seized different equipment from the spot several times and ordered the sand lifters to remove the dredgers from the bridge area. Administrative action will be taken if sand lifting is done there again.\" Upazila Nirbahi Officer ATM Farhad Chowdhury said he will look into the matter and take action against the perpetrators."

      "authors": "\nReuters, Santo Tomas, Philippines\n",
      "text": "The fine ash drifting into the school gym on gusts of wind is a constant reminder for evacuees in the Philippines of the volcano that threatens to bury their homes forever. As they sit in the spaces fenced in by the few bags and boxes of belongings they could carry, evacuees wonder how long they will have to wait to know whether Taal volcano will devastate the region or sputter back to sleep. \"It's all in God's hands now. We are not sure if we will have a home to return to,\" said Leonita Gonzales, 52, who fled with the rest of her household from the danger zone around Taal. Her banana palms were destroyed by the ash that fell after the volcano started to gush smoke on Sunday. She is uncertain whether her home's tin roof will be able to bear the weight either. Nearly 44,000 people have fled the 14km (nine mile) danger zone around Taal, where volcanologists have warned a devastating eruption could rain rocks and magma and set off a tsunami from the lake in which the volcano sits. On Tuesday, more than 1,100 evacuees packed into the gym and classrooms at the state university at the Santo Tomas town, some 20 km (12 miles) northeast of where Taal continues to puff clouds of ash and steam through old and new fissures. Occasional tremors signalled the forces rumbling beneath the earth and set hearts pounding. \"Don't tell me you're brave. When disaster strikes, you will call on all saints, big or small,\" said Obet Dionglay, 61, who had trekked through roads deep with ash to seek refuge. Dionglay's hut had been crushed by bamboos bent to the ground by the weight of the ash and he had little hope that his three pigs and dozen chickens would survive. Dionglay recalled Taal's last eruption in 1977, when his hometown of Talisay had escaped largely unscathed. Although Taal is one of the world's smallest active volcanoes only 311 metres (1,020-foot) high, it can be deadly: an eruption killed more than 1,300 people in 1911. At the evacuation centre, a couple of dozen kids kept busy with an impromptu dance class. A delivery of water gave some people a chance to wash the grit from their bodies for the first time in days, but many complained of a lack of sleeping mats, blankets, toiletries and face masks despite generous private donations. \"For now, we endure, we live with nothing,\" said Ferdinand Paderan, 39, who evacuated with his wife and two children. But even as thousands more people were being evacuated from the danger zone, some defied official warnings to head back in to collect belongings or tend livestock that they could not bring out. \"I went home and checked it. It's a good thing no one stopped our tricycle on the way home. I fed the chickens and the dogs,\" said Leonel Gonzales, 32, a tourist guide at Taal Lake, who fled with his one-year-old daughter and pregnant wife. \"We will stay here to make sure we are all safe. We will check on the pets again when the volcano calms down.\""

      "text": "Foreign critics of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan deride him as a quasi-dictatorial megalomaniac. But Erdogan--who was Turkey's prime minister for 11 years before being elected president in 2014--is now a reckless gambler, too. In short order, Turkey will send troops to Libya at the request of the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), which has been besieged in Tripoli for the last eight months by the advancing forces of Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). This will be a military and diplomatic folly. Erdogan already has the distressing example of the Syrian conflict on Turkey's own doorstep. Does he really imagine that sending a few hundred--or even many thousand--Turkish troops to aid the beleaguered GNA will somehow resolve Libya's tragic and bloody turmoil, itself the result of the 2011 intervention by foreign powers that toppled Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's regime? If Erdogan expects either a GNA victory or an imminent peace settlement, he is deluding himself. Haftar's well-equipped LNA has the support of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and (at least covertly) France. With mercenaries from Russia and Sudan on his side, Haftar must feel rather more optimistic than Fayez al-Sarraj, the GNA's prime minister. Support for the GNA from Turkey and Qatar, along with the fig leaf of UN recognition, weighs rather less in the military balance. So, what explains Turkey's entry into Libya's dreadful conflict as yet another proxy warrior? One factor, often baffling to outsiders, is the ideological and political influence throughout the Middle East--or at least its Sunni Muslim parts--of the Muslim Brotherhood. Founded in Egypt almost a century ago, the Brotherhood favours a transition (peaceful, it has always maintained) to theocratic government. As its slogan proclaims, \"Islam is the solution.\" That is a problem for the ruling families of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain, all of which regard the Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation seeking to undermine their power. So, too, does the oppressive Egyptian regime led by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who mounted the 2013 military coup that ended the Brotherhood's disastrous year governing the Arab world's most populous country. Only Turkey--specifically, Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP)--and tiny Qatar (very much at odds with neighbouring Saudi Arabia) view the Brotherhood with enthusiasm rather than alarm. On the almost frivolous premise that my enemy's enemy is my friend, the fact that Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt support Haftar is excuse enough for Turkey and Qatar to support Sarraj and the GNA. The bigger reason for Erdogan's adventurism in Libya, though, is that it fits his desire for Turkey to play a determining role in its region for the first time since the demise of the Ottoman empire (of which Libya was once a part). On the surface, that ambition sounds reasonable enough. Turkey has a population of more than 80 million, the second-largest military in NATO, and a relatively developed economy. It deserves to be treated with respect--which is why the European Union's obvious reluctance to advance the country's membership bid is a blow to Turkish pride. But Turkey's pursuit of its regional leadership ambition has come at a high cost. When the AKP came to power in Turkey almost two decades ago, Erdogan's mentor was Ahmet Davutoglu, an academic who then became foreign minister and eventually prime minister. Davutoglu was keen to expand Turkey's influence abroad, but under the slogan \"zero problems with our neighbours.\" How ironic, then, that Erdogan has created problems with almost all of his neighbours. The EU cannot accept Turkey's appalling record on human rights, especially following the military's failed coup attempt of 2016. Israel cannot abide Turkey's support for Hamas (which is aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood) in Gaza. And virtually everyone is exasperated by Turkey's policy in Syria, which features attacking the Kurds--the most effective fighters against the Islamic State--and ambivalence towards several jihadist groups. Significantly, Davutoglu has broken with Erdogan and formed a rival political party. True, Erdogan's supporters can justifiably argue that Turkey has become a regional player to be reckoned with. The EU has to be financially generous, or else Turkey may let hundreds of thousands of Syrian and other refugees from war and poverty flood into Europe. Russia and Iran, which both support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, recognise that a settlement of the Syrian conflict will depend on Turkey's acquiescence--hence the continuing three-party peace process that began three years ago in Astana, Kazakhstan. Even the United States under President Donald Trump has had to eat a slice of humble pie: Turkey, regardless of NATO sensitivities and American economic threats, stands by its decision to buy a Russian air-defence system. But the Libyan venture may be a step too far. On December 5, the Turkish parliament ratified an agreement between Erdogan and Sarraj that sets a maritime border between their two countries. The Turkish-Libyan deal ignores international law--as the EU, Cyprus, Greece, and Egypt have pointed out. It also ignores geography, because the Greek island of Crete lies halfway between the two countries. And it threatens the January 2019 agreement between Egypt, Israel, Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority to exploit the gas reserves of the eastern Mediterranean. Erdogan is the epitome of today's strongman political leader. But by the time his Libyan gamble sours, as it inevitably will, he will have run out of both luck and friends.

      "text": "April 26, 1972 BANGABANDHU'S INTERVIEW\n\tWITH THE STATESMAN Bangabandhu is today quoted as saying India will not and cannot negotiate any settlement with Pakistan on the prisoners of war issue without Bangladesh's concurrence. Resident Editor of The Statesman, Delhi, Kuldip Nayar, who had an 80-minute interview with Bangabandhu in Dhaka, says in despatch that Bangabandhu would not comment on India holding talks with Pakistan because it is an independent  country and thus free to have a dialogue with anyone it wishes. The report says that the point Bangabandhu made repeatedly, at times in a raised voice, was that Bangladesh is an independent country without any string pulled from outside. He further said that Pakistan held that Bangladesh was dependent on New Delhi's wishes and that the surrender of Pakistan Army before the joint command of Indian and Muktibahini forces was a fiction. Bangabandhu said, \"It is not fiction but a hard fact.\" He said that he knew that Bhutto wanted to exchange the PoWs with the Bangalees in Pakistan. Soldiers were never exchanged with civilians, \"I am willing to exchange the Biharis in Bangladesh with the Bangalees in Pakistan,\" the Bangladesh Prime Minister added. INDIA-BANGLADESH WATER TALKS OPEN Bangladesh and India reaches complete understanding today in all issues in the first round of minister-level talks on flood control, water and power resources. In a two-hour long talk, the representatives of the two countries discuss the sphere of mutual cooperation in the fields of flood control, flood forecasting, flood and cyclone warning and irrigation of common rivers. The topic of power resources also features in the discussion. INDO-PAK TALKS BEGIN The emissaries of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and President Bhutto today hold a discussion for three and half hours on various aspects of India-Pakistan relations in a bid to frame an agenda for a summit meeting between the two countries.  SUGGESTION INVITED FOR THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION The Constitution Drafting Committee has so far considered the clauses relating to fundamental rights and the fundamental principles of state policy for inclusion in the draft. Interested people have been requested to submit their suggestions to the committee for consideration. These suggestions should reach the secretary of the Committee by May 8, 1972. ABANDONED PROPERTY OWNERS ASKED TO SUBMIT VALID DOCUMENTS Dhaka Nagar Committee has asked the lawful owners of abandoned properties to come forward with valid documents to establish their right of ownership. The persons concerned have been advised to submit applications to the sub-divisional officer, Sadar South, within three days.

      "text": " Pabna farmers are cultivating more land for the second season of onion eyeing the high price of the spice in the market, forgetting the loss they had suffered from their flood-hit crops in the September-October season. Deputy Director Md Azhar Ali of Pabna Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) told The Daily Star, \"In the last season, farmers cultivated 44,000 hectares of land and produced 6.5 lakh metric tons of onions. This season, we have targeted to cultivate 49,800-hectare for producing 7.5 lakh metric tons of onions.\" If the weather remains dry and favourable, then this season's target will be the highest ever production in Pabna, according to officials of DAE. Deputy director Azhar informed that the total yearly demand for onion in the country is 24 lakh metric tons, and the nine upazilas of Pabna usually supplies 25 percent of it. Next year, they are hoping to supply 33 percent of the total demand of onion, he added. The deputy director noted that farmers, who could save their crop from flood during the last season, earned a lofty profit from the Mulkata variety selling it at the high market price. This motivated the other farmers to increase their cultivation for the current season. Since mid-September price of onion kept on rising from Tk 40/kg to the record high of Tk 250/kg, becoming somewhat steadier in the last two weeks selling between Tk 50 to Tk 100 per kg, as quoted on the website of the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. Sources at the DAE explained that Mulkata sown during September-October is harvested around December while the current variety sown now will be ready for harvest by March. This correspondent visited Santhia and Sujanagar upazilas, where most of the onions in the district are grown. An onion farmer of Sujanagar upazila Md Ishhaque Ali said, \"In last season, I cultivated 66 decimals of land but I did not get expected profit as most of the crop was damaged in sudden flood this year. I managed to save 20 mounds of onion and sold those for Tk 60,000. The handsome price of onion inspired me to cultivate again in more areas this season.\" Ishaque is cultivating onions on 165 decimals of land by leasing 99 decimals, expecting to earn Tk five lakh to Tk six lakh from sale of the crop, he said. He, however, is concerned about winter rain damaging his crop again. \"If it rains during winter, we may face loss again,\" he said. Forgetting the loss that he had incurred in the last season, retired college teacher Dulal Hossain of Narinda village in Santhia upazila cultivated five bigha of land for onion expecting to earn Tk five lakh. He, too, is worried about the weather.  \"The recent dense fog disrupts onion cultivation. At the same time, we are worried about rain during winter,\" Dulal said. Farmers also urged the government to stop importing onions during harvesting time, so that they can get expected profit."

A two-member Indian delegation accompanied by Rejaul Karim, executive engineer of Hydrology of Pabna, and twi other Bangladeshi experts started monitoring flow of water at Hardinge Bridge point, about 2500 feet upstream from the Padma river at Kushthia's Veramara point. The Indian delegation members are Nashid Iqbal and Rahul PR, deputy director and sub-divisional engineer of Indian Central Water Commission (CWC). \"Under the Ganges water sharing treaty, the experts of the two countries monitor the flow of water in Ganges and Padma from January 1 to May 31 every year.\" said engineer Md Rejaul Karim. At the same time, a four-member Bangladesh delegation including Md Mujibur Rahman, executive engineer of Joint Rivers Commission (JRC); and AKM Anisur Rahman, executive engineer of Water Development Board; also started monitoring water level at the Farrakkah point in India. The flow of water in the mighty river Padma is much better than that of previous years, all because of the sudden rise of water level in September and October last year, according to the Hydrology Department, a wing of Ministry of Water Resources. \"Padma is flowing above 1 lakh to 1.4 lakh cusec at the Hardinge bridge point at this moment this year although the water level was 80 to 90 thousands cusec last year.\" Md Rejaul Karim said. This is the highest ever water level in Padma during dry season, Rejaul said adding that the water level increased in September and October last year due to the sudden flood."

The leaders of the organisation appeal to the workers to devote themselves to the task of reconstruction of the war-ravaged economy by increasing production in industrial units. The Convention demands Tk 200 as minimum wage for workers. They also urge the government to take immediate action to resume operation of the closed mills and factories.

      "text": "Today marks the 8th death anniversary of Shilpaguru Safiuddin Ahmed. As a pioneer of printmaking in Bangladesh and a modernist painter of the first generation, he remained reclusive in his life and his art. The underrated artist lived and worked in both the twentieth century and the new millennium. His individual style was known as indigenous modernism.  Besides his experimentation with artworks, what remains majorly unknown is his skill and passion for photography. His photographs are resourceful in knowing him more intimately as well as in understanding the socio-cultural conditions of his time. His son, Ahmed Nazir, talks about the artist in a recent conversation with The Daily Star.   \"Baba definitely had an affinity for photography. He bought a German Contaflex SLR camera with different lenses and coloured filters during his stay in Europe in the fifties,\" recalls Nazir. \"For a person who always lived a simple life, I believe it was quite expensive, but he wanted to have it.\" From a young age, Nazir saw the Shilpaguru develop photographs in the dark room. \"I would always be in awe when the pictures appeared from those frames, dipped in chemical solutions,\" he adds. \"Baba had an eye for details. Perhaps the moments he captured and his framing influenced his art making. He would often give borders to his art pieces, like a photograph.\" Balloon vendors, tea sellers and fishermen were recurring subjects of the Shilpaguru's canvas.  According to Nazir, the artist took note of everyday characters that gave a city its unique identity. Living in Swamibag, he captured the essence of the city in many of his charcoal and crayon works. Talking about his father's famous work, Labourers with fiddler on the roof, Nazir explained that the orchestral routine of 'Chhad Petanor gaan', during which the labourers set the roof in the rhythm of a song was an everyday sound for Dhaka dwellers. A violinist played instruments for the labourers. The Shilpaguru's wife Anjuman Ara Ahmed Renu played a vital role in his life and work. Nazir fondly recalled that his mother was always supportive of his father's choices. She was the model in many of his photographs. \"During the flood in 1956, our house in Swamibagh was inundated,\" he says. \"Baba made Maa sit on a boat and took some photographs there. Later in many of his artworks related to the flood, there were influences of those captures.\" In one of the pictures, the Shilpaguru poses in the snow, with his wife's name written on it in Bangla.  It took Nazir by surprise when he developed the slide into the photographs. \"He clicked all these photographs by himself with the help of a timer. Today, taking a selfie is child's play, but Baba practiced it in the late fifties,\" Nazir mentions. The artist, inspired by Rabindra Sangeet and Nazrul Geeti, often shared music records with his wife. According to art historian Professor Syed Azizul Haque, when the Shilpaguru toured Paris and Leningrad, he observed the sounds of the orchestra, which appear in his watery work, titled The Sound of the Water, where he mixed the mediums of print making. He used etching, aquatint, sugar aquatint, mezzotint, lift-ground, engraving, deep etch, dry points and others. It took him almost three years to complete the work.  \"He never played music while painting. He would only listen to music after he finished his work and cleaned all his brushes,\" Nazir recalls. Shilpaguru Safiuddin Ahmed's close associates fondly describe him as an organised, a disciplined and a sharply-dressed person. He was hardly ever completely satisfied with his own artworks. As putting one's signature on an artwork usually indicates the Ahmed Nazir, a noted artist and photographer himself, followed in his father's footsteps. However, Nazir explained that his father never wanted any followers. \"Although Baba would give away his techniques, he always felt that everyone must have their own experiences. He believed that every artist develops a distinctive style. They do not have to set benchmarks. They only have to be original,\" Nazir concludes.        "

Earlier, the rights bodies said two boats carrying around 500 Rohingyas were refused by Malaysia and Thailand in mid-April and were adrift in the sea. The UN, European Union and a number of rights bodies had called on Bangladesh to rescue the Rohingya and shelter them. Bangladesh, however, had responded that it was not possible to shelter any more Rohingya, as it was already facing huge pressures to shelter and manage the 1.1 million Rohingya in Cox's Bazar. However, Bangladesh today rescued a portion of them. \"It is a very tiny boat compared to its 280 passengers. They are starving. The navy has given them food, water and first aid,\" a navy official told AFP. The men, women, and children on the boat -- found some 40 kilometres south of Saint Martin's Island -- were seen squatting with their hands on their knees, he said. Authorities say they are likely to have come from Myanmar's Rakhine state rather than camps in southeastern Bangladesh where nearly one million refugees live, as they did not have identity cards issued by UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, AFP reports. On May 3, Bangladesh Navy sheltered at least 29 Rohingyas, who swam to the coast of Teknaf in Cox's Bazar, were then rescued by locals and finally handed over to the navy. Earlier on April 16, some 400 Rohingyas were rescued by Bangladesh authorities. They were, however, quarantined in the Rohingya camp healthcare facilities. On May 4, Bangladesh Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen said no more Rohingya would be sheltered in Cox's Bazar camps because of the risk of a coronavirus infection in the camps. \"If any new Rohingya is to be sheltered, we will take them to Bhashan Char,\" he told The Daily Star. Bangladesh Navy has built a housing facility of 120 cluster villages on the 40sqkm island in Bhashan Chair under a Tk 2,312 crore project for accommodating one lakh of the nearly 1 million Rohingyas sheltered at the crowded camps in Cox's Bazar. However, the authorities were considering shelving the relocation plan after the UN and other aid agencies opposed the plan, saying there were risks of flood and cyclones and that the location did not have facilities for accommodating aid agency officials."

From Milan, near the northern epicentre of the crisis, to the capital Rome and Naples and Palermo in the south, social media showed people on their balconies or leaning from windows and singing the national anthem or popular songs over the past couple of days. Yesterday at noon, many people across the country went onto their balconies to offer a round of applause to the doctors and nurses working on the frontlines of the crisis. With the coronavirus pandemic spreading rapidly across the world, Italy is the worst affected country in Europe, with at least 17,660 cases and 1,266 deaths by Friday. Italy's hardest hit area remains the prosperous northern region of Lombardy around the financial capital Milan, but the virus has spread across the country. The government has imposed an unprecedented lockdown, closing schools and most shops, barring all but essential movement and telling people to remain in their homes. On social media, celebrities have urged people to stay at home and to wash their hands regularly. Ordinary Italians have posted a flood of images showing life under lockdown, as well as jokes about the crisis and the difficulty of maintaining domestic harmony. The government and leading public figures have also sought to reassure the public. Hashtags with encouraging messages like #allwillbewell have proliferated as authorities and individuals have tried to maintain a sense of optimism amid the shutdown."

We all hope to be in such a place one day, a place where we can sink into luxurious languor, freed of our worldly cares, lulled by the perfume of blossoms, the shushing of trees, and the soft plash of water. Meanwhile, in this world, many of us try to recreate, in our own small way, little oasis of beauty for ourselves, sometimes on our rooftops, and if we are lucky, in our own compounds. For the rest of us, there are the neighbourhood parks that are tended with great care, and get better every day.  One afternoon, entirely by chance, I came across a small beautiful park in DOHS. It was quiet and almost empty, except for a few gentlemen. There were numerous trees, and a wide walkway around a lovely central pond, with benches along the water's edge. It looked so idyllic that I immediately sank onto one of the benches with a sigh, grateful to be able to gaze at the tranquil surface of the water. It was so restful and the breeze so fresh, that a feeling of utter calm washed over me. I closed my eyes, completely immersed in the moment. I had a great urge to sit there till evening, look out over the water, and wait for the sunset, and the stars to come out. Water is mesmeric, whether it be in a simple bowl, a beautiful lake, or a sea. Gazing at water soothes the soul, and calms the most restless mind. The sight and sound of it can bring instant serenity for the few moments we allow ourselves to forget our daily cares, put the world aside, and just breathe. For me, in those silent minutes of water gazing, different images flow through my mind. A sense of tranquillity washes over me. Sometimes, memories flood in, of the carefree joy we used to feel as children, a joy sometimes forgotten, but still present in the deepest recesses of our hearts. My heart cools as other visions emerge, of the comfort of a loving family and kind words, all the more vivid, vibrant and beautiful, because time has burnished them with the golden gloss of memory. Sitting near the jacaranda and pink cassia in the park, listening to the cry of the koel, and the cheerful chirping of sparrows, and watching all the other \"kar-o-bar\" of nature were moments of pure perfection. Lost in my thoughts amidst the lovely surroundings, I returned to the present with surprise, and realised that I had things to do and places to be. Refreshed and revived, I walked with reluctant steps to the exit, cheered by the thought that I could visit again whenever I wished.    "

      "text": "Recently I went to Banani kitchen market for my weekly shopping and I saw, to my astonishment, the retailer putting all the purchased items in several polythene bags which were completely banned in Bangladesh in 2002. How did these banned bags make an entry to our markets despite the government's efforts to popularise jute bags? I believe this is due to the fact that the use of jute bags is not yet mandatory for all products. It was 1980s when polythene bags first entered the Bangladeshi market. They were light, cheap and could be disposed of after being used only one time. The bags quickly gained popularity and captured the market driving out jute shopping bags. However, our experience with plastic shopping bags is not good at all. The disposed bags find their way to detrimentally affect the environment. They reduce the fertility of soil, kill marine animals and disrupt the drainage system. The longstanding flood of 1998 was the outcome of water clogging in the sewerage line with heaps of polythene bags. After that unprecedented flood, the government, in the face of popular demand, enacted the ground-breaking law in parliament to ban plastic shopping bags. This ban left our markets with several alternatives such as bags made of jute, cotton, paper and nylon. Which one do you think is the best? I believe no other alternative is as suitable as jute, given that it has the potential to contribute to our economy and good for the enviornment. Jute was our main exporting item until the arrival of plastic shopping bags in the market. The climate and soil of our country is conducive to the production of jute. Thousands of people used to earn their livelihood through farming jute and manufacturing jute products. However, our jute industries started declining due to the onslaught of polythene bags. But I am sure that we can revive the industry if we can ensure the use of jute shopping bags for packaging all of our daily needs. The use of jute shopping bags will help us clean our environment. Researchers found that one hectare of jute plants sequester over 15 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Jute is fully bio-degradable, compostable and recyclable. It has no harmful effects on the human body or on Mother Nature. Jute leaves have medicinal properties and are eaten as vegetables. Jute is 100 percent non-toxic and its cultivation requires less pesticides and fertiliser. Jute bags are strong, durable and reusable. If it has so many economic and eco-friendly attributes, why will people not use jute bags for shopping and packaging? This is because the use of jute bags has not yet been made mandatory for shopping and packaging of all commodities. The government formulated some rules in 2013 (amended up to 2018) under the provision of Section 22 of the \"Mandatory Jute Packaging Act 2010\", that require businesses to compulsorily use jute bags for packaging only 19 commodities. Therefore, we do not see jute being used much for wrapping except for these 19 commodities. Owing to their limited use, jute shopping bags are still not cheaper compared to polythene bags. This factor coupled with the laxity in enforcing the law has paved the way for illegal trading of plastic shopping bags in the market. Then how can people be made to use jute bags for shopping and packaging all goods? We can do that by bringing an amendment to the existing rules 2013 (amended up to 2018) formulated under Section 22 of the Mandatory Jute Packaging Act 2010 so as to make the use of jute bags compulsory for packaging not only 19 products, but also all other products. If we can do so, the demand for jute will rise and farmers will be more encouraged to cultivate jute. To incentivise farmers, the government could disburse microcredit among them. In addition to that, the government may pay a certain amount of subsidy for manufacturing of jute shopping bags at the initial stage to keep their price reasonable. Once the production goes up, the price of jute shopping bags will come down automatically. At the same time, our law enforcing agencies will need to monitor the market strictly to stop the illegal trading of plastic or polythene shopping bags. Finally, I would like to reiterate that the mandatory use of jute bags can bring back the golden days of our jute sector and stop the illegal trading of plastic shopping bags. The regeneration of jute industries will create more employment opportunities, increase our export earnings, keep our environment clean and advance us towards sustainable development.

Flood Forecast and Warning Centre (FFWC) of the BWDB issued a forecast notice in this regard on its official website today, reports our Sylhet correspondent. Talking to our correspondent, Md Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, executive engineer of FFWC in Dhaka, said \"India's Meteorological Department forecasted 150-250 millimetre of rain in Meghalaya and Barak valley of India, and 100-120 millimetre at Tripura valley of India. The rainfall might occur from April 17 to 20. Moreover, it will rain in the north-eastern part of Bangladesh.\" \"Following the forecast of rainfall, we are predicting that the water of all major rivers of the Meghna Basin will rise promptly and small rivers might flow over the danger level. That's why we are forecasting a possible flash flood in the region,\" he said. Taking the forecast in consideration, Sunamganj Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Abdul Ahad today circulated a notice to harvest Boro paddy as soon as possible before the flash flood hits the haor region. In the notice, the DC ordered all the Project Implementation Committees (PIC) to strictly monitor the conditions of dykes, constructed under Kajer Binimoye Taka (KaBiTa) to protect the Boro harvest of the haor. This year, 633.36 kilometres of rehabilitation work of the levees at 36 haors was completed under 746 projects in the district spending around Tk 132 crore. According to the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE), Boro paddy has been cultivated on 2,19,450 hectares of land in Sunamganj this year while last year's cultivation area was 2,28,440 hectares."

The country's Disease Uncontrol Centre run by Kooks (DUCK) came up with the brand new method even though THERE ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH TESTING KITS FOR ALL VIRUSES TM in the country. \"This virus is very easy to diagnosis. You don't even have to call our hotline. We hate all the calls we are getting. My social life has been in tatters ever since people started worrying so much about dying. It is the inevitable,\" Nawabzada Fauna, head of DUCK, told reporters outside her testing facility which has so many kits you would not even believe it. \"So your nose is blocked, you have a cough, and perhaps a little pneumonia. But have you recently been to a different country? Specifically these three countries? If not, then you do not have it. Take an aspirin and chill out,\" they said, adding that no one should panic if they are not tested considering the number of testing kits the centre has can flood the entire country. The new method of quick diagnosis has also instilled confidence in the country's people, with many now going out and about knowing they are not carriers of any virus. Asked if the situation was so much under control, then why were all modes of public transport being suspended, Fauna said it was because too many people were using those to come to the DUCK headquarters. \"We have asked people on numerous occasions not to come here. But they just don't want to listen. Why are they behaving in such an odd way? There is nothing to see here except the billions of testing kits that we have. I promise. I swear to you,\" they said, breaking down in tears. Fauna finally asked the reporters to leave and covered themselves with protective gear, including a bullet-proof vest and a very, very stupid looking hat.

      "text": "As part of a class assignment last semester a group of architecture students asked me a question: what makes a city inspiring? This set me thinking. It could very well be a policy question, particularly for countries that are undergoing accelerated urbanisation and envisioning the next phase of their social, political, and national evolution. As experts demonstrate, cities have become not only the drivers of economy but also sites of national soul-searching. I answered the students this way: a city is most inspiring when it is fair to all its inhabitants. A city is fair when it creates a culture of social justice across all its domains. A city ensures social justice when it offers equal opportunities to all its people. But fairness, social justice, and equal opportunity are abstract ideas. How does one institute them in the physical conditions of the city? Is it possible to transform the abstract idea of social justice into something that we can visualise, feel, and experience in the spaces of the city? As I pondered these questions, I recalled what the American poet and civil rights activist Maya Angelou once said: \"I always knew from that moment, from the time I found myself at home in that little segregated library in the South, all the way up until I walked up the steps of the New York City library, I always felt, in any town, if I can get to a library, I'll be OK. It really helped me as a child, and that never left me.\" A public library in the city--accessible to all, irrespective of their economic and social backgrounds--could be one of the most poignant symbols of a city that values social justice for all. Maya Angelou's racial discrimination in a segregated library in the American South could be mitigated by the robust publicness of the New York City library, where she didn't have to face the inhumanity of racism. She could walk up the steps of this library and feel that she could enter it without having to pass any discriminatory barriers. Angelou provided a most incisive physical portrayal of social justice in an urban condition with this simplest statement: \"... in any town, if I can get to a library, I'll be OK.\" The feeling that you can access any opportunity and facility in the city without any social and economic hurdle is a monumentally empowering condition. When that feeling is pervasive among the city's people of all ages, economic and social classes, gender, ethnicities, and physical abilities, a city is fair and practices social justice as its moral foundation. As the year ends, I have been thinking about the \"fairness\" measure of cities in Bangladesh. As I go around in Dhaka I keep wondering, is this city fair to all its people? Is this city guided by a basic philosophy of social justice? Again, fairness and social justice are abstract notions, and often ignored quietly and cleverly as left-leaning obstacles to a neoliberal worldview, typically rigged to favour the privileged and the powerful. But we need to decide how we develop our cities and what kind of humanity we institute in them. This is important for two main reasons. First, the middle-income status that we seek will be meaningful and sustainable only when that status is fair and achieved not at the expense of a vast majority of people. Second, around the world today, city administrators tasked with creating liveable cities are increasingly concerned with how to embody fairness in the city's planning. Liveability is not guaranteed by Smart City and its techno-glitz and seamless mobility. A Smart City could be liveable, provided it is fair to all its people, not just to its power-wielding CEOs and corporate executives. So, I ask: How do we qualitatively measure something as abstract as fairness in the city's infrastructure, roads, footpaths, buildings, water sources, public transportation, green spaces, shops, and public places? Let me offer an example before I address my key contention today. Consider public transportation from a fairness or social justice angle. Are we offering safe and gender-friendly mobility options for women in the public domain? If not, we are perpetuating patriarchy by means of public transportation, complicit in the creation of a biased social system that is inherently unfair. For me the most glaring case of unfairness in the city resides in the way we define, confine, and manage poverty in our cities. It is unhelpful that in Bangladesh urban poverty is still largely understood through the lens of slum studies. To frame urban poverty in terms of the inadequacy of urban amenities (such as toilets and piped water supplies) in slums alone is to ignore a deeper social question: What is society's attitude towards the \"poor\"? It is important to revisit this age-old question to disrupt the cycle of urban poverty in a sustainable way. Urban economists, social analysts, urban planners, and others produce a vast body of data on poverty in cities. But the big data can also overwhelm our compassion, our humane instincts. Any empirical study of the poor must be coupled with a fundamental ethical position that the poor is not the Other. The poor shouldn't be abstracted as a social category--a binary opposite of the bourgeois self--to be quarantined for research and experimentation. While empirical research is essential, without human compassion it bureaucratises the concept of poverty and dehumanises the poor. It is not that empirical knowledge of the poor is unnecessary. But without compassion as public policy, big data keeps on calcifying the poor as a category, one that is isolated from any decision-making power structures. Without any real agency, this category is on perpetual life support. In his work on gender justice, Amartya Sen argued that real societal progress is made when women's empowerment takes a strong hold on the public's ethical imagination. A similar argument could be made in the case of poverty studies. An ethically based view of the poor as fellow citizens, rather than as an objectified research category, is urgently needed for any sustained alleviation of poverty. It is time policymakers, municipal administrators, and urban planners rethought urban poverty as a problem of social justice, not just as a problem of economic development. The issue of urban poverty should be examined with a bit of moral quandary and introspection into how the class-conscious bourgeoisie defines itself as the opposite of the poor. This very definition constitutes the central problem of urban poverty. The poor must be seen with a human face, not as an abstraction. The problem is that the poor's social invisibility is very much embedded in how we define poverty as an unrelatable experience of the Other. And, big data tends to preserve the invisibility of the poor. Lest we forget, the idea of poverty has not been static in history. Both the idea and strategies for its relief have changed since the Industrial Revolution and industrial cities grew manifold in the modern era. Consider London, for instance. In the wake of the city's intense urbanisation in the 19th century, a highly divisive political and philosophical debate raged about reforming laws related to poor people. At the centre of this vexing debate was this question: would top-down \"help\" (from the state and wealthy private citizens) diminish the poor's ability to take personal responsibility? So intense a philosophical discussion was it that even Tocqueville and Hegel followed the English turmoil with much fascination. The dichotomy of state- and donor-driven top-down strategies of poverty alleviation and empathetic, bottom-up, and activist NGO efforts in capacity building among the poor continues to animate the urban poverty debate. In designing cities in our country, urban planners can begin by acknowledging that urban poverty is, first and foremost, a crisis of social justice. City professionals must debunk the urban mythology that the poor is a closed social group in need of an improved ghetto. It is important not to forget that the poor are typically stuck in spatial traps, often legitimised through official planning processes. These spatial traps are slums, unsanitary industrial zones, flood-prone river banks, and footpaths. By keeping the poor confined to the urban fringe and hazardous areas, cities often deny them social justice and access to networks of economic mobility. By ghettoising the poor in undesirable, environmentally precarious areas, both cities and capitalistic systems seek to fortify a false sense of social hygiene. To mitigate this problem, urban planners need to see the disenfranchised classes not as the poor but as fellow \"social citizens,\" who deserve, like anybody else, equitable access to healthcare, housing, education, and economic opportunities. But, at the same time, social citizenship comes with responsibility. All people of the city must accept the basic idea of the greater good--Greeks called it eunomia or good order--for the city to function as a fair place. An inclusive and liveable city treats all its citizens with fairness and humanity. Only when we agree with the moral argument of this hypothesis can we begin to overcome the tyranny of GDP-centric economic philosophies, in which the majority of the people don't have access to opportunities that cities offer. A just city is the most liveable.   Adnan Zillur Morshed is an architect, architectural historian, and urbanist.

In its 15-year history, the Global Risks Report has never listed biodiversity loss as one of the top five global crises in terms of impact, although it did make the top five global risks in terms of likelihood in 2011, and is featured in the latter list for 2020 as well. Weapons of mass destruction occupied the top position for global risks in terms of impact for the last three years. It is now number two, losing its position to climate change or more specifically, our failure to take proper action against climate change. Biodiversity conservation and climate change are topics that often come to the fore in discussions. The Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) is an example of this. The BCCSAP talks about adaptations in the fisheries sector, livelihoods in ecologically sensitive areas, and the creation of coastal forests to fight cyclones. \"Monitoring of the ecosystem and biodiversity changes and their impacts\" is, however, the only programme in that document that explicitly mentions biodiversity. Nevertheless, given the urgency of other climate actions, like flood risk management or inventing climate-resilient crops, one may expect biodiversity-related actions to get less priority among the 44 programmes listed in the BCCSAP. Back in 2010, when Bangladeshi climate change activists and environmentalists were disappointed with the outcome of the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in December 2009 and the country's own Bangladesh Climate Change Trust (BCCT) and the donor-funded Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF) were yet to be functional, something fantastic happened. Two long-term development partners of Bangladesh, the British Department for International Development (DFID) and the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), supported the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to produce the \"Protocol for Monitoring of Impacts of Climate Change and Climate Variability in Bangladesh\". This was indeed a ground-breaking effort by Bangladesh. After rigorous exercise, detailed methodologies and indicators were developed to measure climate change impacts on the biodiversity of our rivers, wetlands, coasts, sea, and forests. It also did the same for other important areas, like hydro-meteorology, agriculture, livestock, human health, livelihoods, and poverty. After its publication in 2011, if used, this comprehensive impact monitoring protocol could have helped us to learn how our biodiversity has been changing over the past decade due to climate change and how to respond to that. Unfortunately, this never happened--a missed opportunity indeed. In fact, this document and long-term biodiversity monitoring simply disappeared from the climate change discussions in Bangladesh. It is not mentioned, for example, in the second and third National Communications on climate change submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2012 and 2018, respectively, or in the sixth National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) submitted in November 2019. The BCCRF has so far allocated around USD 385 million to a wide range of ministries, agencies and NGOs to implement about 660 climate change projects. However, it did not fund any large-scale, long-term biodiversity and ecosystem monitoring project; it only supported a short-term one in the coastal areas, with the Nature Conservation Management (NACOM), through the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) in 2013. Bangladesh has completed a good number of biodiversity projects since the impact monitoring protocol was finalised. Large, multi-year conservation projects, like the Integrated Protected Area Conservation (2009-2012) and Climate Resilient Ecosystems and Livelihoods (2013-2018), both supported by USAID, engaged in biodiversity monitoring in the protected areas to check project impacts. The Wetland Biodiversity Rehabilitation Project (2009-2016), supported by the German agency GIZ, monitored the aquatic biodiversity of the wetlands and rivers of the Rajshahi region, continuing two years after the main project activities were finished. However, none of these projects, such as the USD 36 million Strengthening Regional Cooperation for Wildlife Project (2011-2016) of the Bangladesh Forest Department or the Switzerland-funded Tanguar Haor project (2006-2016) of the IUCN, thought of monitoring climate change impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. These missed opportunities show that even long-term conservation initiatives that are sufficiently funded by single donors can fail to acknowledge the need for long-term biodiversity monitoring with regard to climate change. They failed to see beyond the project tenure. Our recent conservation projects have been thinking more of people, rather than biodiversity per se. It is true--we have lost a decade and are still yet to combine biodiversity monitoring with climate change, but let us now look forward by looking into the past. One of the best examples of long-term monitoring of biodiversity in Bangladesh is the migratory water bird census. Every winter, the Bangladesh Bird Club (BBC), a group of bird-enthusiasts, coordinates this survey in haors, riverine chars, and the coastal areas of Bangladesh. Over the last three decades, this census has been giving us a yearly picture of migratory water birds, their numbers and diversity. We can now use this large database and link it with national and regional climate data from the past 30 years to explain changes in the migratory birds' visits to Bangladesh. We can do the same for other ecosystems. Numerous projects and individual researchers have been collecting biodiversity and ecological data from different forests and wetlands, as well as natural and modified ecosystems, for a long time. We can compile the data, analyse it, and study the trends of change in certain wildlife, plants or other elements of a particular ecosystem over the past few decades. Relating biodiversity data with changes in our climate could help us to forecast the future trends and plan for it. But who will lead or coordinate such ventures? We have two real opportunities before us. The Bangladesh Forest Department is now implementing the USD 175 million Sustainable Forests and Livelihoods (SUFAL) project, funded by the World Bank, to be run till 2023. This project has an \"Innovation Window\" to fund research proposals, including those related to climate change impacts on forests and biodiversity conservation. SUFAL can take up the impact monitoring protocol developed by the IUCN in 2011, update it, and start implementation. This would be a fantastic step forward, one which should have started long ago. The second opportunity comes with the second phase of the Sundarban Management Project (2019-22). In this phase, GIZ plans to establish a model of ecological monitoring of the Sundarbans, which will later be scaled up for the whole forest. UNESCO's World Heritage Committee (WHC) has been expecting ecological monitoring reports on the Bangladesh Sundarbans since 2016. In 2017, the Bangladesh Forest Department compiled available ecological data and submitted a report to the WHC. That report could be a good starting point and climate change-biodiversity aspects could be included in it, which is also what the WHC suggested. We talk about creating new forests with billions of seedlings to remove extra carbon dioxide from the air and fight climate change. Stopping ecological destruction, protecting existing forests and wetlands, and restoring damaged ecosystems are also an important part of reducing climate change impacts. At the same time, we should immediately put together our biodiversity information and climate data, in order to analyse the past changes, predict the future, and make preparations for what lies ahead.

      "text": "The government has already taken a number of measures to save Robi Cropconsidering the lockdown and because the haor region--especially Sunamganj, Sylhet and some northern districts such Gaibandha, Jamalpur--may suffer flashflood. These measures include regular weather forecast, early warning, arranging harvest machines and so on. These are some of the most important and timely decisions by the government as first steps to ensure food availability.   The government has also issued cyclone early warning for coastal areas and is taking actions to save crops. The Agricultural Loan Department of Bangladesh Bank also declared Tk 5,000 crore for agricultural loan, especially for the horticulture, fruit, fisheries, poultry, dairy and other businesses. This is also a great initiative considering that these small businesses have already been affected due to the pandemic. The concerns related to food security, however, remains unaddressed by and large due to a number of factors. Everyday food items such as rice, vegetables and other necessary perishables are produced by the smallholder and women farmers in Bangladesh. And these farmers are already suffering. For example, Taslima Begum of Chorgacha, Ghoraghat is a small poultry farmer. Due to the COVID-19 crisis she cannot sell her chickens at the market, so she is forced to sell the poultry items at a loss of Tk 50 per kg to her neighbours in fewer quantity. Afroza Begum of Fulchari, Gaibandha is a vegetable producer. Because of the lack of market access, she is selling pumpkins at Tk 5 per kg whereas the regular price is Tk 25-30 per kg. It is watermelon season in Bangladesh and farmers normally sell their products at Tk 30-40 per kg. The farmers in Patuakhali are currently selling watermelons at Tk 8-10 per piece whereas their cost of production is over Tk 20 per watermelon. How are these farmers going to recover the loss they are already suffering? We need to take note that these farmers' livelihoods are depended on their produce and any loss means they will not be able to go into production next season without external assistance. Coming back to paddy, with the hope that flash flood or other natural hazards will not cause any disastrous situation in any parts of Bangladesh and farmers are able to get their desired harvest, question remains whether the farmers will be able to sell their crop at a fair price. In 2018 hundreds and thousands of farmers protested across the country demanding fair price. The response from the government was helpful, but it was late and inadequate in solving the matter. At present, even if the government manages to buy the paddy and other ROBI crops, how are those going to be processed and stored? This will mean that the rice mills will have to be re-opened during the crisis, risking the spread of the virus. Furthermore, given that inter-city transportation systems carrying food products are yet to be re-established, unless major changes are made and government facilitates are opened for the distribution and redistribution of food products, a food crisis may be inevitable in the long run. The solution lies in following the right strategy considering different timescales. For immediate action, it is important to set up an oversight committee headed by the Ministry of Agriculture with appropriate representatives from key relevant ministries and civil society organisations. In each district and Upazila, a committee should also be established where local transportation authority is represented. Government has already taken the initiative to open school fields for local market to operate. This timely initiative needs to be maintained besides creating interconnectedness between the village market to union market to Upazila market and so on. It is critical to ensure two major things: i) The smallholder and women farmers are getting fair price; and ii) A safeguard mechanism is in place to prevent COVID19 from spreading. At the short to medium term(1-3 months), considering the flood season and its impacts on agriculture, farmers may lose the rainfed Amandue to early flood or excessive rain during seedling period. It is critical to note that unless we ensure fair price for smallholder and women farmers for their Boro crop, they will not be able to invest in Amanproduction. Seed and fertiliser supply will become a challenge. The smallholder and women farmers will require access to interest free loans with the option to repay post Aman harvest. This will be the most critical stage of intervention in terms of ensuring food security for the remaining year. Considering the worst case scenario, the government and other actors must map possible solutions including countrywide planning of distribution and redistribution of the products. We also need to ensure quality seeds where community seedbank initiatives can play a critical role. Addressing overall market mechanism to support the smallholder farmers will be the key challenge in the medium term. Due to the current travel ban, buyers from distant places are failing to reach the market and the producers are deprived from optimum price of crops especially vegetables and seasonal fruits. Lack of infrastructure to preserve vegetables or perishable products has been one of the biggest challenges for small farmers for a long time contributing to their losses every year. Considering the products that are to be harvested between July to September, the government must take measures including flood preparedness, etc. Given that there could be a global food crisis, the government should strengthen its safety net programme ensuring that food is available, accessible and affordable for the poor and marginalised. Special schemes for the smallholder and women farmers is needed to ensure they survive until the next harvest. The government must also ensure the transportation system is functioning well considering that the COVID-19 crisis may continue. Guaranteeing transparency and accountability throughout the process to stop theft and exploitation by the powerful and the middlemen are must. In the long term (6-12 months), it will be important to monitor the global food security situation, market system as well as climate condition. We must not forget that Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to the imapcts of climate change and throughout the year, we may face flood, river erosion, cyclone and hailstorm--and dry period at the end of this year. It is important to note that even if everything goes right and there is no climate induced disaster in 2020, we will still continue to carry the loss that we already suffered due to the current crisis. Therefore, the government must be ready to continue prioritising food producers, the smallholder and women farmers, along with the small and medium agricultural businesses. The policymakers and city dwellers may be buying food from the supermarkets now, but supermarkets do not produce crops and will never do. It is the smallholders and women farmers like Taslima and Afroza who produce the food we eat. If they do not survive, it will be only a matter of time before we face a food crisis in Bangladesh.

      "text": "FEBRUARY 6, 1972 BANGABANDHU'S HISTORIC  VISIT TO KOLKATA\n Bangladesh Prime Minister Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is accorded a hearty welcome on his arrival in Kolkata this morning on a two-day visit. Bangabandhu is presented the guard of honour by a contingent of the Dogra Regiment. The national anthem of Bangladesh and India are played.  Bangabandhu and Indira Gandhi have had wide-ranging talks on various issues, including the future economic planning and review of the situation in the subcontinent, for a little over three hours.    Speaking at a huge public rally at Brigade Parade Ground in the afternoon Bangabandhu says that the bond between Bangladesh and India is not based on expediency. He maintains that the close bond between the countries exist because the peoples of both countries have unflinching faith in the principles of secularism, democracy, socialism and nationalism. He tells the gathering, \"I bring with me the love and gratitude from the people of Bangladesh for the people of India.\" He is wildly cheered when he says that the liberation of Bangladesh would not have been possible if not for the gallant support of Indira Gandhi and the Indian Armed Forces. The venue of the public meeting turns into a human sea.   The banquet tonight is hosted by Indira Gandhi in his honour. Bangabandhu calls for peace and stability in the subcontinent saying, \"Let there be an end, once and for all, to the sterile policy of confrontation between neighbours. Let us not fritter away our national resources, but to use them to lift the standard of living of our people.\"    Referring to the growing cooperation between Bangladesh and India, Bangabandhu says that geography dictates that the two countries should cooperate in all possible fields, and particularly in the fields of economy, construction of barrages, flood control and taming of the mighty Brahmaputra and Ganges.   Mujib's portrait in currency notes Bangladesh Bank governor discloses that Bangladesh's currency will bear the portrait of Bangabandhu. The currency will be available by the last week of this month. Bhashani NAP extends cooperation The extended meeting of the Bangladesh NAP (Bhashani group) working committee resolves to extend cooperation and give enough time to the Awami League government in materialising socialism, democracy and secularism in Bangladesh. The meeting also calls for immediate measures to arrest the price hike and stop the smuggling of goods.  Mass graves found in Pabna Horrifying signs of barbarism by the Pak Army have been revealed in Pabna after several mass graves were dug open inside the WAPDA office compound. The site had been serving as Pak Army's headquarter in the district. The graves prove that more than 3,000 civilians were slaughtered by the Pak Army.

      "text": "\"I've got to do something for my country -- that's all I could think of. I have to free my country from Pakistan,\" Kina Kora reminisced about how he felt when the Pakistani occupation army cracked down on unarmed Bangladeshis in the dark night of March 25 in 1971. Now 68, Kina Kora can still vividly recollect those turbulent days of '71 when he was only nineteen years of age. Some time around the end of March or early April that year, Kina and three others left their village to join the war -- the war to liberate their motherland. One of the three was his 21-year-old brother Sattan Kora. The other two, Thopal and Gopal Kora, also 19 and 21 at the time, were also siblings. These four courageous youths belong to the Koras -- a timid but hardworking small ethnic community on the verge of extinction. Only 21 Kora families still live in the remote village of Haljay, in Dinajpur's Biral upazila. Before Bangladesh won independence in '71, there were around 200 Kora families in Haljay, now known as Korapara. With sparkle in his eyes, Kina continued the story. \"We were young and brave\" and driven by Bangabandhu's fiery speech of 7th March.  After leaving the village, on their way to receive training on guerrilla warfare in West Bengal of India, they somehow got separated. Sattan ended up in Siliguri's Panighatta, where he received his training. The other three got their training in Hamzapur, near the western border of Dinajpur.      Kina said, \"After the training at Hamzapur, I was stationed in Ghugudanga village of Dinajpur Sadar upazila, where the Pakistanis had a stronghold.\" \"A fierce battle ensued between the Pakistanis and us. We lost our comrade Alim Uddin there. Later, we engaged in heavy fighting with the Pakistanis in Jamalpur and Ramsagar areas of Sadar upazila.\" But around September, before the struggle for freedom of his motherland ended, Kina had to return home to stand by his family's struggle for survival.    \"My family was in a dire situation when I came home,\" Kina said, adding that his family and the villagers were suffering from a near-famine situation. Out of his three compatriots, Gopal, son of Papua Kora, died in 1973 and Gopal's brother Thopal is now incapable of talking perceptibly due to paralysis, said Kina, who still makes a living by working as an agricultural day labourer.     His brother Sattan, who passed away in India in 2018, was wounded during the war, he said, adding that Sattan had moved to the country in 1987 following a land dispute with villagers. Saleq Khokon, a Dhaka-based writer and researcher of small ethnic communities, said about 13 years ago, when Sattan Kora was visiting his village home, Saleq had the opportunity to interview Sattan and Thopal -- two among the four Koras who had fought in the Liberation War of 1971. Confirming that Sattan had sustained injuries during the war, Saleq said he could not interview Kina due to time constraint at the time.  Asked whether he or the other Koras, who fought in Bangladesh's War of Independence, ever received any formal recognition as freedom fighters, Kina said the four Kora fighters were given some sort of documentation by the then government after independence of the country. \"We were given some papers then. But, that got washed away during the devastating flood of 1987,\" he said helplessly. Ever since he returned home from the war 49 years ago, he and the other members of his community have been struggling to stave off hunger and poverty, Kina said. \"Thopal's and my family still live from hand to mouth.\" Even though they fought for the country's independence without expecting any return, said the Kora fighter, adding that formal recognition as freedom fighters during their lifetime would offer some solace amid financial hardship and illness."

      "text": "The United States on Thursday took the grim title of the country with the most coronavirus infections and reported a record surge in unemployment as world leaders vowed $5 trillion to stave off global economic collapse. More than 500,000 people around the world have now contracted the new coronavirus, overwhelming healthcare systems even in wealthy nations and triggering an avalanche of government-ordered lockdowns that have disrupted life for billions. In the United States, more than 82,000 people have tested positive for COVID-19, edging out Italy, which has reported the most deaths, and China, where the virus was first detected in December in the metropolis of Wuhan. With fears mounting of a global recession if not depression, leaders from the Group of 20 major economies held crisis talks by video link Thursday, pledging a \"united front\" to fight the outbreak -- along with an enormous financial injection. Spain's death toll has surpassed China's and the country's hospitals have been badly hit \"The virus respects no borders,\" the leaders said in a statement. \"We are injecting over $5 trillion into the global economy, as part of targeted fiscal policy, economic measures, and guarantee schemes to counteract the social, economic and financial impacts of the pandemic.\" They also pledged \"robust\" support for developing nations, where coronavirus could next take hold after ravaging China and then Europe. But the unity pledged by the G20 has been in short supply with China and the United States trading barbs over their handling of the coronavirus crisis. And Italy as well as Spain, which has the second-highest death toll, objected to a draft economic plan by the European Union which they saw as too weak. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte wants a \"strong and sufficient\" financial response that deploys \"innovative financial instruments truly adapted to a war,\" his office said. Record one-day toll in France Alarmed by the rapid spread of the sickness in Italy, France has taken aggressive action to stem the virus and went under lockdown on March 17. But the 365 deaths reported Thursday was its highest in a one-day period and, alarmingly, included a 16-year-old girl -- a rare case of a young person succumbing to a virus that has devastated the elderly. \"It is very difficult to estimate when the peak will come,\" French health official Jerome Salomon said. \"People who are ill now were infected before the confinement began.\" A health worker carries a body on a stretcher outside Gregorio Maranon hospital in Madrid \"Now there is less contact, people are going out less and get infected less. So we hope there will be fewer people getting sick next week and fewer people going to hospital,\" he told reporters. With hospitals under severe strain, medical workers in Italy and Spain are making painstaking choices. \"If I've got five patients and only one bed, I have to choose who gets it,\" Sara Chinchilla, a pediatrician at a hospital near Madrid, told AFP. \"People are dying who could be saved but there's no space in intensive care.\" In Britain, the National Health Service said London's hospitals are facing a \"continuous tsunami\" of seriously ill COVID-19 patients, despite a lockdown imposed this week. People stand on designated areas to maintain social distancing as they queue outside a medical store in Allahabad, India And in New York, the virus hotbed in the United States, authorities hope to stem the growth of infections as the city needs to more than double the number of available hospital beds. \"Almost any scenario that is realistic will overwhelm the capacity of the current healthcare system,\" Governor Andrew Cuomo warned. Economic devastation The pandemic has already, and rapidly, been catastrophic to the global economy. Containers are seen at the Port of Los Angeles on March 26, 2020 as the economy faces severe pressure from the coronavirus In the United States, the world's largest economy, the Labor Department reported that 3.3 million people applied for unemployment benefits last week -- by far the highest number ever recorded. Job losses have swept across sectors from food services to retail to transportation as nearly half of the country has closed to \"non-essential\" businesses. \"It is staggering. We are only seeing the initial numbers; they will get worse, unfortunately,\" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters, estimating that half a million people in the city would lose work. Hundreds of people queue outside a government welfare centre, Centrelink, in Melbourne on March 23, 2020, as jobless Australians flood unemployment offices But Wall Street soared for a third straight day, recouping more of this month's hefty losses, on expectations for the largest stimulus in US history. The Senate early Thursday unanimously passed a $2 trillion package that will provide cash payouts averaging $3,400 for a family of four. Speaker Nancy Pelosi voiced confidence that the House of Representatives would follow suit on Friday. President Donald Trump, who has been hoping that a strong economy would win him re-election in November, has been one of the few US leaders to seek a quick return to normal. Priests at risk The global lockdown -- which also hemmed in India's huge population this week -- tightened further on Thursday as Russia announced it was grounding all international flights, while Moscow's mayor ordered the closure of cafes, shops and parks. Tokyo's millions of citizens have been told to stay home, too, just days after the city was forced to postpone the 2020 Olympic Games for a year. China said it was barring entry to most foreigners, fearing that imported cases were undermining its success in bringing domestic transmissions way down. And South Africa braced for a nationwide lockdown as its cases climbed to more than 900 -- about a third of Africa's 2,975 cases. Italy has the highest death toll in the world, though new cases have dipped slightly in recent days The impact of the virus has stretched well beyond frontline health workers, with billions trapped in their homes and facing what experts say could be lasting psychological harm. In virus-stricken Italy, clergy members have been among the worst affected. Out of Italy's more than 7,500 deaths, 67 have been priests. But offering a glimmer of hope, both Italy and Spain have seen lower daily rates of new infections this week. The World Health Organization called Italy's numbers \"encouraging signs\" but warned it was \"still too early to say whether the pandemic is peaking.\" A study from Britain's Imperial College provided a grim prediction, saying 1.8 million people could die worldwide this year even with swift action to halt the virus."

      "text": "People from all walks of life have come forward to help farmers harvest Boro paddy, the main crop in the haor region of Sylhet division.  It happens at a time when farmers are complaining of shortages of labourers due to the travel restrictions amid the nationwide shutdown enforced to fight the Covid-19 outbreak. Now, Boro harvesting is progressing amid the coronavirus scare and threat of impending flash flood. Teachers, students, political party activists, Village Defence Party members, transport workers, sand-stone workers, shopkeepers, NGO workers, and other professionals joined in the paddy harvesting. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension in Sylhet, around 1.68 lakh people are now involved in harvesting Boro in the division. Of them, over 1 lakh are in Sunamganj alone. Apart from volunteers, a good number of labourers from different districts are coming to the haor region under special arrangements. A team of 42 labourers from Lalmonirhat was sent to the haor region on Thursday, and the district administration already prepared a list of 500 labourers and they would be sent there soon, said Abu Jafor, deputy commissioner of the district. So far, around 6,000 labourers from different districts have gone there under special arrangements, said DAE officials. Abdul Ahad, deputy commissioner of Sunamganj, said, \"Labourers from different districts are coming. We are providing them with food, accommodation and ensuring their health safety as much as possible. We also arranged relief for them. Moreover, we are trying to encourage people from all social classes to take part in the harvesting.\" Arman Hossain, who runs a decorator shop at Gajaria Bazaar in the district's Jamalganj upazila, said, \"Since March 26, my shop has remained closed and it became difficult to survive. As I am a farmer's son, I know how to harvest and joined a team of 42 people to harvest the Boro paddy. We are getting relief, wage, and farmers are also getting help.\"  Around 4,000 VDP members have been working since April 21, said Rafiqul Islam, director of Bangladesh Ansar-VDP's Sylhet range. Ariful Haque, a farmer of Gajaria village in Jamalganj, said, \"I did not have enough money to employ labourers to harvest my paddy, but volunteers arranged by the local union parishad harvested an acre of Boro field without any wage. It helped me a lot.\" Meanwhile, the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) on April 21 issued a circular urging teachers and students to be in assistance of farmers during the harvest and permitting farmers and farm labourers to use schools and colleges. Prof Harunur Rashid, director of DSHE in Sylhet, said, \"We are getting immense responses from teachers and students. We are not sure how many of them are working. We urged all to work maintaining social distancing.\" Like others, leaders and activists of Bangladesh Krishak League, Chhatra League, and other pro-Awami League organisations are working as volunteers. Shamima Akther Khanam, a lawmaker from the reserved seats for women, has been monitoring the paddy harvesting in haor fields since April 14. Shamima, also human resource affairs secretary of Bangladesh Krishak League central committee, said more than 1,000 leaders and activists of the organisation were involved in harvesting the paddy. As people have extended their helping hands and the weather is favourable, 42 percent of Boro paddy in the region have been harvested till Thursday, said Srinibash Debnath, additional director of Department of Agricultural Extension in Sylhet. But farmers are in fear as it rained yesterday morning and Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre of Bangladesh Water Development Board earlier issued a warning of flash flood on April 27 or later there. Sunamganj DC Ahad said, \"This year, the cultivation was late due to slow receding of haor water and most farmers cultivated BRRI 29 variety as neck blast disease hit BRRI 28 variety last year, which delayed the harvesting time.\" [Our Lalmonirhat correspondent contributed to this report]"

      "text": "On March 25, listening to a briefing on the then available latest global statistics about the COVID-19, I learnt that the global total of recorded cases was then a little over 400,000, spread across over 169 countries. Of these, the first 100,000 cases had taken 67 days, the second 100,000 about 11 days, the third 100,000 about 4 days, and the last 100,000 less than 4 days. We were told in no uncertain terms that this was the first great pandemic, of truly global proportions in a hundred years, after the so-called \"Spanish flu\" of 1918-20, (which had afflicted over 500 million people or a quarter of the world's population at that time, and inflicted a death toll of between 17-50 million). The entire world today is in a dire economic situation, a global recession worse than the recession of 2009 is inevitable, only this time it would be somewhat different in nature: there would be a very big hit on the services sector, in which there are typically no rebounds; supply chains are standing fractured or not available any longer; there would be a very likely rise in food prices because of severe disruptions to the logistical or other chains on which assured availability of food depends; social safety measures would prove woefully inadequate; and domestic and external shocks would reinforce each other, perhaps exponentially. Three days later, on March 28, 2020, the number of globally recorded cases was nearly 600,000 with the numbers increasing steadily by the hour. In other words, the number jumped from 400,000 to 600,000 in about 3 days. Of these, currently infected patients number over 436,000, of whom over 23,000 are in serious or critical condition. The United States has now surpassed Italy (and China) with the highest number of cases (over 104,000). Mr Trump can now boast of presiding over the new epicentre of this pandemic. I am willing to bet that by the time this article is published all the numbers will be higher. This situation will get worse, given the now well-established trajectory globally. While experts everywhere, from different nationalities and different disciplines in science, are near unanimous in agreeing that the crisis will become worse, much worse, and all countries (including the United States), are either woefully inadequately prepared or ill equipped, or both. Chinese President Xi Jinping has reportedly reached out to President Trump and offered help in sharing knowledge (gleaned from its own experience) and equipment to tackle the critical situation. However, because of stonewalling and sheer cussedness on the part of some, the G-20 virtual summit ended in a fiasco. Mr Trump kept insisting on publicly labelling this disease as the \"Chinese virus/Wuhan virus\", to which the Chinese objected with injured ego. Mr Trump would do well to delve into some history of his own country, and recall that the so-called \"Spanish flu\" of 1918 is now thought by many as actually having originated in an obscure farming community in Haskell county in Kansas, USA where a farm worker caught the infection from a pig, and then carried it to Spain where it ballooned among an unsuspecting population from where it travelled to the World War-I theatre (in which Spain, ironically, was not a protagonist), and then travelled back to the United States, in two successive waves, from Summer, to Fall and then Winter. The Spanish flu should therefore be correctly renamed today as the American flu of 1918. Perhaps this will satisfy the respective egocentricism of the respective world leadership today, who should instead buckle down to addressing the crisis and putting in place institutional arrangement to deal with the current pandemic, and its resultant fallouts on food and employment security and ensure that more such pandemics do not recur. We should assume that more such unexpected pandemics will very likely occur, because there are countless strains of coronavirus among other animals, birds and reptilian species than we know of, and with spaces of separation between species and homo sapiens ever shrinking (or basic principles of ecological equilibrium having been ignored and shattered), the intervals between such pandemics could well also dwindle, alarmingly. Pandemics jump over time and space, across peoples, countries and cultures, ballooning exponentially. Despite all indications to the contrary, people worldwide took the onset of the current pandemic complacently, almost smugly, holidaying on beaches when governments advised them to go into social distancing and self-isolation. When Saudi Arabia and some Gulf states advised their nationals that they should abjure from going to mosques and instead remember God and offer their prayers in the isolation of their respective homes, we have had examples of people in some of the most densely populated Muslim countries (including in Bangladesh and Indonesia) congregating in very large numbers for congregational prayers or \"waz mahfil\" sessions (in which there could have already been some infected people, but quite unaware of their being so). In Malaysia, one such event resulted in notable community transmission of the disease.   In Bangladesh, the officially announced total number of cases today is 48, with 5 fatalities. The official statistics does not necessarily reflect the accurate statistics, because of the very tiny number of the population having been tested, even among the several thousand returnees from China, Europe or elsewhere who were allowed to go home on condition of \"self-isolation\" which was merrily (and most irresponsibly) largely not observed. The Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) announced its detection two days ago of the first community transmission of the disease. I await with considerable trepidation to what the figures will exponentially translate into in, 7 days, 14 days or 21 days from today.   In my last missive on the subject published in this newspaper a week ago (\"Implications of coronavirus for regional and global cooperation\", The Daily Star, March 22, 2020) I had advocated that we needed to shift our focus away from viewing our security within the traditional paradigm only, but consider our overall security as contextually nested in what I describe as ecological security that includes a host of non-traditional causes all of which would at some stage, sooner or later, translate into a traditional security threat as understood conventionally. Ecological and non-traditional security may be defined as maintaining a dynamic equilibrium not only among human societies (friction among whom used to be the traditional source of conflict) but equally, if not far more importantly, between humans and nature, humans and other species and humans and pathogens. Any disruption to this dynamic equilibrium between any two or more component sets of actors or factors integral to this equilibrium would translate into a disturbing, risk-fraught disequilibrium endangering all. Man, as the dominant species with a steadily burgeoning population, has a greater ability today than ever earlier to affect how this equilibrium is maintained. Changes in the complex intertwined relationship between man, nature and other species can be destabilised by changes in nature or in human behaviour. As resources needed by man for his sustenance and development steadily dwindle, fierce competition has already increased among peoples for control over decreasing resources that sustain human societies. In this struggle for control, non-state actors have increasingly emerged as posing by far the greater threat to societal security than conventional military threats by other state actors. Maintaining ecological equilibrium in any given geo-space has, therefore, emerged as increasingly integral to not only ensuring the overall wellbeing of the peoples who inhabit that space, but to ensuring their continuing security, traditional and non-traditional. But this requires exponentially increased cooperation and collaboration between states. Most of the NTS threats need a well-thought out systemic and institutionalised response, in a pan-Westphalian context. I have earlier advocated for establishment of a regional Authority called South Asian Regional Ecological and Environmental Authority (SAREESA), which would have several sectoral bodies under it to address different NTS threats, one of which would be addressing pandemics. Now that we are wading ever deeper into, and increasingly floundering in, a pandemic and we are assured by experts that more such pandemics are very likely to afflict us unless we think in anticipatory mode, and not just to address pandemics--who is to say that some natural cataclysm like another great tsunami, or a mega volcanic eruption or a mega earthquake is not likely to occur anytime soon? I for one, would wish governments and peoples to be prepared for such unpredictable scenarios, however unlikely they might appear to be at cursory glance now. Such an organisation would be an authoritative umbrella body (rather than a toothless association or \"club\") with the mandate and authority to enforce adherence to its collective decisions. It should be headed by a ministerial-level Governing Council, that should meet periodically, at least once a year, by rotation in each member-country's capital. Decisions should be arrived at by a simple-majority consensus. Decisions once taken, are mandatorily binding on every member state. Its decisions are like laws passed by the national parliaments, but where the decisions are in conflict with national laws, they over-ride the latter. The body will derive its funding through mandatory contributions from each of its member states, the amount proportional to its population but weighted by its GDP. Where necessary, it may dictate levying of taxes on income according to income slabs to meet sudden emergencies. For wildcard events, (like the current COVID-19 pandemic) it will maintain an emergency fund of a predetermined amount raised through taxes as well as central funding. Money for this fund is to be raised through levying taxes on specific/related activities, like travel, entertainment, retail sales, etc. While the amount of the levy would be relatively very small, since it is collected on a daily basis from a wide swath of the population across the entire region, cumulatively it would translate into a considerable amount which would be sufficient to cope with an extraordinary emergency in its immediate aftermath. This umbrella body will have at least six sectoral cells to deal with food security, water security, energy security, employment security, health security, and environmental security, respectively. For the moment, let me present only three of these sectoral cells: wildcard events, health security and food security--these are the specific areas where I foresee immediate problems likely to confront us all in the wake of the current COVID-19 pandemic. At the first signs of an event occurring (like current pandemic, or a major tsunami, flood, drought, earthquake or volcanic eruption), it would trigger off a regional warning system that keeps vulnerable populations informed and evacuates endangered populations where deemed necessary. It also activates across the region emergency related services to go into standby mode to cope with health and food security. Ensuring health security With global and regional movements of people and all sorts of goods, including flora and fauna, and particularly microbial or viral passengers having become easier with the communication revolution and induction of super jumbo aircraft, ensuring regional health has become a greater challenge than ever. The contemplated authority's mandate would include regional health management issues linked particularly to communicable diseases (cholera or other diarrheal diseases, typhoid, etc.) that may escalate into epidemics or pandemics. For the purpose, it maintains a central information system of networking that links all national/or designated hospitals to a regional information centre. It monitors the instances of communicable diseases that are known to spread easily, and tracks movements of such diseases if they occur. The centre also maintains a regional health registry, where it stores and updates on a continuing basis, data from its network of hospitals across the region, information on supplies of protective gear for medical personnel and patients, testing kit and life support equipment. Certain industries may be designated and tasked with being geared to produce such kits/equipment/gear on an emergency basis to cater to national and regional emergencies, as well as to replenish stock. It will also monitor animal diseases linked to poultry and livestock on a similar basis and will exercise the authority to impose very strict quarantine regulations in order to forestall spread of man or animal borne diseases across borders. Ensuring food security The authority will require each member state to maintain a minimum reserve of food grains stock (rice, wheat or maize, etc.) sufficient to meet consumption requirements of its nationals for four months, at any given time. This is to meet national emergencies within its own domestic jurisdiction. The cost of this buffer stock is met from the domestic national budget of each member state. Additionally, a pre-determined quantum of food grains, pulses, powdered milk, bottled water, salt and sugar is also stored along centrally designated locations, (close to airports/railway stations/ports) and along the borders with adjacent countries for fast movement to disaster areas in times of extraordinary trans-boundary emergencies. Both categories of the above reserve stocks will have specifically designated shelf lives. These items will be put on the market at least two months before expiry of such shelf life but also be replenished simultaneously with new stock with new shelf lives. The cost of these emergency buffer stocks will be raised through a system of food security tax/levy raised monthly at a rate not less than a minimum percentage of an individual's regular income (say a monetary unit per person irrespective of par value of that unit vis-a-vis the strongest unit in the region). This principle of compulsory contribution will instil a sense of value and participatory ownership that raises the importance of this scheme in the public perception. In case of a disaster outside the region (another region located near or far away, in the same or another continent), individual countries will be required to contribute in aid to the afflicted outsider region from its own domestic reserve, provided it has the capability or a viable plan for replenishment of its own stock in a timely manner. Similar contribution may be made from the regional reserves mentioned above also, provided replenishment is lined up within a reasonable timeframe. The regional authority should be able to requisition multi-modal transportation vehicles (marine, air, riverine or road) from any or all of its member-states' civil and military resources. For this purpose, it can maintain a database of all such available transportation, listing what is available and where at any given time. And for this, the national civil and military bureaucracies will be required to update a centralised database on a regular, continuous and real-time basis. While most ideally, we need to have a regional body for such an unprecedented emergency, (and I had hoped in my last article that this crisis would have impelled us to move towards such a dynamics), if that does not happen, Bangladesh should take the lead in instituting measures envisaged above on a national basis and set an example of good governance that might nudge others to emulate. As Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore famously exhorted: \"if no one heeds your call, walk alone\". Sooner or later, others will be compelled to join, inspired by the example you set.

Maulana Zubair Hassan, the imam of Kakrail Mosque in the capital and leader of a faction of Tabligh Jamaat, will administer the Munajat seeking blessings and well-being for mankind. Thousands of devotees from home and abroad will take part in the prayer. Tabligh Jamaat, a coalition of Muslim devotees, has been organising the event on the bank of Turag river, near Tongi upazila of Gazipur, every year since 1967. The first phase of the Ijtema is mainly allocated for the followers of Maulana Zubair.  The second phase will be held from January 17 to 19. This phase is allocated for the followers of Indian preacher Maulana Saad Kandhalvi. FIVE MORE DIED IN IJTEMA Meanwhile, five more devotees died at the Ijtema venue yesterday, mostly due to heart attack and old-age complications. With them, a total of nine people died so far since Friday. The dead are Ali Azgar, 70, from Barisal; Md Yusuf, 45, from Narayanganj; Md Shahjahan, 60, from Brahmanbaria; Tamij Uddin, 65, from Cumilla; and Abdur Razzak, 50, from Rajshahi. Manjur Rahman, deputy commissioner of Gazipur Metropolitan Police, said the bodies were handed over to the families after their namaz-e-janaza at the Ijtema ground. To ensure security of the event, law enforcement agencies have taken up a multi-layered security measures. Members of police, Rab and intelligence agencies have been deployed in the adjacent areas. Over 400 closed-circuit television cameras, 25 watch towers and 11 checkpoints have been set up to monitor the area, police said."

The AL general secretary said elections using EVMs is a modern system. But as election date is approaching, BNP raises questions over EVM and neutrality of poll, he added. Quader said BNP does not do pro-people politics rather it performs politics for the looters or millionaires. \"BNP has public support neither in election nor in movement,\" he said. The minister said the government led by Bangabandhu's daughter Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is a government for the poor people. The government always stands beside people in their well and woes, he added. The AL general secretary said BNP does not stand beside people, who suffer in cold or flood rather they make complaints staying in Dhaka. Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi, State Minister for Relief and Disaster Management Dr Md Enamur Rahman, AL Joint General Secretary AFM Bahauddin Nasim, Rabeya Alim, MP, District unit AL president Dewan Kamal Ahmed and General Secretary Mamtajul Haque, addressed the function, among others. AL Organizing Secretary BM Mozammel Haque presided over the function. According to party sources, around 50,000 blankets will be distributed in Rangpur division under the auspices of AL. The AL general secretary handed over the blankets among the district unit leaders for distribution while he also distributed 3,000 blankets among cold-hit people on the occasion."

Talking to BSS, the prime minister says that the people of Vietnam should be allowed to decide their own fate. He adds that the whole world is concerned over the situation in Vietnam. Bangabandhu further says, \"I am sure that the peace-loving people of the world, particularly the democratic people of the USA, are in favour of the struggling people of Vietnam.\" INDIA-BANGLADESH ACCORD TO SHARE WATER RESOURCES Bangladesh and India agree to set up a joint power coordination committee in order to share the power resources of the two countries for mutual benefit. Disclosing this at a press conference held today at the conclusion of the first minister-level meeting on water and power resources between the countries, Dr K L Rao, Indian minister for irrigation and power, says that the two governments have already agreed that Tripura and Mizoram of India would receive power from Bangladesh whereas Jessore and some other northern districts of Bangladesh would receive power from West Bengal of India. Dr Rao further informs that the formation and terms of reference of the Joint River Commission have been discussed and agreement reached. The matter would now be finalised by the two governments, he adds. Steps for coordinating flood forecasting and cyclone warning have also been discussed. Meteorological data will be exchanged between the two countries. The question of sharing the water of Ganges, Teesta and other common rivers between Bangladesh and India have also been taken up at the minister-level talks. Dr Rao says that it has been decided that the subject will be discussed at the prime minister level. Earlier, Dr Rao called on Bangabandhu at Gonobhaban and had a 30-minute discussion with the prime minister.   NO TALKS UNTIL PINDI RECOGNISES BANGLADESH Bangabandhu firmly stands by his previous stand that there is no question of joining talks with Pakistan unless it accepts the reality of Bangladesh. Commenting on a Pakistani report that the Indo-Pak summit would be held in Delhi in four or five weeks' time and that Bangabandhu might also take part in the talks, a source close to the Bangladesh government says today that there can be no talks, no discussion and no summit with Pakistan until and unless Bangladesh is recognised as a sovereign people's republic by Pakistan.

Explaining the salient features of the import policy, Commerce Minister MR Siddiqui says that there will be no import of luxury items for the period. Although the aim of the government is to arrange import through government agencies as far as practicable, it has been decided to allow import in the private sector since the government agencies are not fully equipped to handle all the import requirements and since there is also a need to rehabilitate the trading community engaged in import business. The government has also decided to induct newcomers in the import trade for a number of items. Preference will be given to those newcomers who suffered during the Liberation War including those whose shops and business establishment were damaged. The list of importable items contains essential consumer goods, industrial raw materials, spares and components.  TV CORPORATION ABOLISHED  The government of Bangladesh has decided to abolish Television Corporation. Television will become an attached department of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. FARAKKA WILL BE DISCUSSED BM Abbas, Chairman of WAPDA and adviser of Prime Minister Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on power and flood control, says that all aspects of the Farakka Barrage will be discussed at the high-level India-Bangladesh talks beginning in Dhaka on April 26, 1972 to safeguard the interest of Bangladesh. He adds that the interest of Bangladesh with regard to Farakka Barrage is to obtain from the Indian government a guarantee for a minimum quantum of water for use of Bangladesh. Referring to flood control, Abbas emphasises that joint action is essential to lower flood levels in Bangladesh and ensure increased dry weather flow in the rivers which may be possible through construction of storage dams in upper reaches of the major rivers lying in India. SSC EXAMS BEGIN The Secondary School Certificate examinations begin throughout Bangladesh today. The examinations were due to commence on April 22, 1971. The Pakistan occupation forces made an abortive attempt to hold the examinations in August 1971 in which a handful of candidates appeared. Results of the mocke of examinations were also published in October that year. However, the Bangladesh government declared the results of that farcical examination void in January 1972 and decided to hold the examinations afresh on the free soil of Bangladesh.

      "authors": "\nAP, Washington\n",
      "text": "The White House and Senate leaders of both parties announced agreement early Wednesday on unprecedented emergency legislation to rush sweeping aid to businesses, workers and a health care system slammed by the coronavirus pandemic. The urgently needed pandemic response measure is the largest economic rescue measure in history and is intended as a weeks- or months-long patch for an economy spiraling into recession and a nation facing a potentially ghastly toll. Top White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway shortly after midnight, capping days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure. It still needs to be finalized in detailed legislative language. \"Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,\" Ueland said. The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidised loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well. \"After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic,\" said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, a key negotiator. \"It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.\" At the White House on Tuesday, even as the public-health crisis deepened, President Donald Trump expressed eagerness to nudge many people back to work in coming weeks and held out a prospect, based more on hope than science, that the country could be returning to normal in less than a month. \"We have to go back to work, much sooner than people thought,\" Trump told a Fox News town hall. He said he'd like to have the country \"opened up and just raring to go\" by Easter, April 12. But in a White House briefing later, Trump said that \"our decision will be based on hard facts and data.\" Medical professionals say social distancing needs to be stepped up, not relaxed, to slow the spread of infections. At the White House briefing, the public-health authorities said it was particularly important for people in the hard-hit New York City metropolitan area to quarantine themselves for 14 days, and for those who have recently left the city to do the same. Dr Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, said pointedly at the briefing, \"No one is going to want to tone down anything when you see what is going on in a place like New York City.\" On Capitol Hill, five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins. Even before the deal was reached, news of the likely but elusive agreement had sent the stock market rocketing on Tuesday. The emerging rescue package would be larger than the 2008 bank bailout and 2009 recovery act combined. The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct a one-time payment of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child directly to the public. A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at the insistence of Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, while Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency. Democrats said the package would help replace the salary of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. \"It ensures that all workers are protected whether they work for businesses small, medium or large, along with self-employed and workers in the gig economy,\" Schumer said. Republicans won inclusion of an \"employee retention\" tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies who retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. Democrats pointed to gains for hospitals, additional oversight of the huge industry stabilization fund, and money for cash-strapped states. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters -- including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined. To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program bank rescue, officials said. Trump in recent days has sounded a note of frustration about the unprecedented modern-day effort to halt the virus' march by essentially shutting down public activities in ways that now threaten the US economy. Even though Trump's administration recommended Americans curtail activities for 15 days, starting just over a week ago, the president said he may soon allow parts of the economy, in regions so far less badly hit by the virus, to begin reopening. He continued on that theme Tuesday as he weighed a relaxation of social distancing guidelines after the 15-day period is up. His suggestion that the pandemic could ease and allow a return to normalcy in a mere few weeks is not supported by public health officials or many others in government. On Tuesday, top defense and military leaders warned department personnel that the virus problems could extend for eight to 10 weeks, or longer. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a Defense Department town hall meeting that the crisis could even extend into July. Trump has balked at using his authority under the recently invoked Defense Protection Act to compel the private sector to manufacture needed medical supplies like masks and ventilators, even as he encourages them to spur production. \"We are a country not based on nationalizing our business,\" said Trump, who has repeatedly railed against socialism overseas and among Democrats. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover."

      "text": "Construction industries are responsible for 30 percent of the total global resources, 40 percent of the global energy consumption as well as 30 percent of the total greenhouse gas emission. For example, cement is one of the key construction materials used as binder for making concrete. The amount of cement consumption is estimated at four billion tonnes globally. To produce such a high amount of cement, roughly four billion tonnes of carbon dioxide are released into our atmosphere (equivalent to global CO2 emission of 1.4 kg/capita/day). As the global carbon dioxide emission is about 41 billion tonnes, the cement industries are responsible for almost 10 percent of global carbon dioxide emission due to burning limestone to clinker, the major ingredient of cement. The other key materials that are used in construction works are coarse aggregate, fine aggregate as well as reinforcing steel. The global consumption rates of coarse aggregate (stone chips), fine aggregate (sand), and steel are estimated at 3.4 kg/capita/day, 2.2 kg/capita/day, and 0.6 kg/capita/day, respectively. It is clearly understood that for the production of these construction materials, not only a significant amount of energy is consumed, but also a significant volume of natural resources is used, which are depleting rapidly. Construction industries are, therefore, producing a substantial amount of greenhouse gases as well as consuming a huge amount of natural resources. Construction industries are polluting our environment to produce construction materials and depleting the natural resources. A general question comes to mind though: \"Will our future generations have enough natural resources in order to make ingredients for the construction of homes, offices, and other infrastructures?\" This is a big challenge for engineers today to preserve construction materials for future generations. Therefore, it is necessary to produce graduates from our engineering universities who have the knowledge including a sense of responsibility towards the society, environment, and sustainability.      Bangladesh will become a developed country by 2041. Socio-economic development is taking place everywhere in Bangladesh in line with this vision. As a result, the consumption of materials used in construction works is also increasing rapidly. In Bangladesh, the current rates of consumption of cement, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and steel are estimated at 0.5, 1.3, 0.9, and 0.16 kg/capita/day. The current rates are far behind the global rates of consumption. However, the rates will gradually increase to meet the global rates due to socio-economic development needs. To make our world sustainable, the United Nations has set 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 targets for a period of 15 years from 2015 to 2030. The SDGs were set after completion of the period (2000-2015) of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs were set with the aim of eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, prevention of deadly diseases, expanding primary education, etc. MDGs made significant contributions to the society. It is also expected that SDGs will contribute towards making our world habitable for us and our future generations. Among the 17 SDGs, three are related to nature (SDG 13 - Climate Change, SDG 14 - Oceans and Seas, and SDG 15 - Ecosystem and Biodiversity); four are related to economy (SDG 7 - Energy for All, SDG 8 - Inclusive Growth and Jobs, SDG 9 - Industry and Innovation, SDG 12 - Consumption and Production); five are related to wellbeing (SDG 1 - End Poverty, SDG 2 - End Hunger, SDG 3 - Healthy Lives, SDG 4 - Quality Education, SDG 6 - Water and Sanitation); and five are related to society (SDG 5 - Gender Equality, SDG 10 - Reduce Inequality, SDG 16 - Justice and Peace, SDG 17 - Global Partnership, and SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities). Thus compared to the MDGs, the SDGs have a very wide spectrum consisting of 169 targets related to nature, society, economy, and wellbeing.  Many of the SDGs are closely associated with the construction industries. For example, by constructing a green building, we can contribute to improving people's health and wellbeing (SDG 3 - Good Health and Wellbeing); produce renewable energy at low cost (SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy); create new jobs and boost economy (SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth); introduce innovation through constructing climate-resilient infrastructures (SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure); develop sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities); produce less waste and circulation (SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production); emit less greenhouse gases to combat climate change (SDG 13 - Climate Action); allow biodiversity, including forests, to flourish (SDG 15 - Life on Land); and build strong global partnerships (SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals). It is evident that our architects and engineers need to be familiar with the design of green buildings to contribute to the SDGs in many ways. The construction industries need to take initiatives to implement the SDGs in their business platforms. There are five distinct steps: (1) understanding the SDGs, (2) defining priorities, (3) setting goals, (4) integrating, and (5) reporting and communicating. The goals should be set with time-bound targets. The goals should be monitored, evaluated, reported and communicated among the stakeholders. The industries are to be prepared accordingly, just as universities are prepared for accreditation of their programmes.    Engineers need to consider SDGs during the design, construction, operation, and maintenance processes of buildings. A building needs to be designed keeping in mind energy consumption, material consumption, possibility of utilisation of locally available materials, as well as long-term durability of the building. During construction, a plan for minimising waste should be provided, along with a definite management plan to minimise pollution and ensure health and safety of the workers and all visitors. Materials can be processed in a controlled environment to reduce pollution, improve quality of material, and reduce time and waste. The possibilities of recycling and reusing materials need to be studied carefully. During construction, the methodology of construction, sequence of construction, compaction technique of concrete, curing duration and procedure, removal of shuttering, quality ensuring policies, etc., are to be provided. A maintenance guideline and also re-cycling and re-use of materials after demolition of a structure at the end of service life are necessary. To ensure resilient infrastructures, the local exposure and climate conditions should be carefully considered, such as salinity, flood, cyclone, earthquake, presence of sulfate in soil, etc.   For the sustainability of construction materials in Bangladesh, a significant number of studies have been conducted since 2004 through undergraduate and post-graduate research work under a research project entitled, \"Sustainability of Construction Materials in Bangladesh.\" A significant volume of research studies have been conducted on recycling of demolished concrete made with brick aggregate. The research outputs have been recognised with awards as well as publications in renowned journals, such as ASCE's Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering, Journal of Construction and Building Materials, Journal of Engineering and Structures, etc. The research results demonstrated that demolished concrete can be recycled without compromising the strength requirement of new construction projects. By careful mix design, it is possible to utilise demolished concrete as coarse aggregate to make concrete of strength 4000-6000 psi. Also, studies have been conducted on the utilisation of alternative materials in construction work, such as induction furnace slag as coarse aggregate for concrete, stone dust as fine aggregate for concrete, brick surkhi as fine aggregate for concrete, ladle furnace slag as fine aggregate for concrete, etc. Based on the experimental results, it is understood that these by-product materials can replace natural aggregates (such as stone chips and sand) used for producing concrete. We also conducted several short-term and long-term research projects on utilisation of alternative cementitious materials such as slag, fly ash, silica fume, etc. It was also found that these by-product materials are not harmful for concrete, but have a lot of benefits, such as reduction of carbon dioxide emission, long-term durability, less heat of hydration, long-term strength, etc. There are ongoing studies related to the long-term durability of these materials under natural and artificially created seawater exposure conditions. Design engineers are to be aware of the new findings through continuous learning. Due to the rapid increase in population in Bangladesh, it is necessary to plan for construction of high-rise buildings for offices and residences and avoid stand-alone houses. It will eventually save our valuable fertile land for cultivation.    Construction industries should be aware of the consequences of the consumption of vast amounts of material as well as energy required to produce and maintain the built environment. They also need to come forward and take initiatives so as to achieve the SDGs. The overall industrial atmosphere, quality of product, linkages to the local and international partners, etc., will be improved through these initiatives. Greater cooperation between governments, private sector, universities, and many facets of civil society is necessary to accomplish the SDGs by 2030 and to sustain the human habitat for current and future generations.

When that happens, you could have a burning pain in your chest. Your throat might burn, and you could have a sour taste in your mouth or a cough. You may also hear it called GERD (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease), which is heartburn that happens often. But other conditions can have similar symptoms. Angina: It is easy to confuse heartburn with angina, which happens when not enough blood flows to your heart. But heartburn tends to happen after meals or when you are lying down. Angina is more common after you have been active. The feeling in your chest is more like \"tightness\" or \"squeezing\" than the burning pain of heartburn. Angina symptoms mean you are at risk for a heart attack. Heart attack: While heartburn pain stays in your chest or throat, during a heart attack, a squeezing or aching pressure may spread to your arms, back, or jaw. Other heart attack symptoms include shortness of breath, a cold sweat, and feeling dizzy without warning. Women are more likely to also have an upset stomach or throw up. Gallstones: Gallstones are pebble-like bits of cholesterol or digestive fluids (bile) that end up in your gallbladder. If you have gallstones, after a fatty meal you may have heartburn symptoms that can last for hours. You will likely ache in the centre or right side of your belly and could feel pain behind your shoulders or rib cage. If this happens to you, see a doctor. Stomach ulcer: Sometimes a portion of the lining of your stomach or small intestine breaks down. An open sore, called an ulcer, forms. It can cause burning stomach pain and heartburn that is worse after you eat fatty foods. You will also have lots of belching and bloating. Your pain may be worse at night and between meals. If you have an ulcer, your doctor can prescribe medication to ease your pain and help your ulcer heal. Hiatal hernia: If the diaphragm, the muscle separating your stomach and oesophagus, thins or weakens, part of your stomach may push upward. This allows the acid of your stomach to spill into the oesophagus.  Acid and even food may come back up into your oesophagus and throat. Hiatal hernias can raise your chances of heartburn. Anxiety: Your brain and gut are closely linked. If you feel stressed or anxious, your heart rate can go up and your breathing can get faster. The flood of hormones that causes this reaction can also upset your stomach. Besides heartburn, you can feel queasy, have diarrhoea, or get constipated. Learning to manage your stress through counselling, meditation, or hypnosis may help. Oesophageal cancer: Long-term heartburn raises your odds of getting oesophageal cancer. If your heartburn keeps up despite treatment, your doctor will want to take a look inside your oesophagus. He usually does this with a procedure called an endoscopy. Other symptoms of oesophageal cancer include trouble swallowing and weight loss. Coughing and hoarseness are common, as is chest pain or pressure. If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away. Source: WebMD  "

Syrian aid workers called urgently for a ceasefire and international help for nearly a million people fleeing the regime onslaught in the country's northwestern Idlib province -- the biggest wave of displaced civilians in the nine-year conflict. Turkey, supporter of some rebel groups in Idlib, has been pushing for a renewed ceasefire in talks with Russia, which backs the Syrian regime. Ankara is eager to prevent another flood of refugees into its territory adding to the 3.7 million Syrians it already hosts. The Syrian NGO Alliance said displaced people are \"escaping in search of safety only to die from extreme weather conditions and lack of available resources\". Erdogan said talks with Moscow over the past fortnight had so far failed to achieve \"the desired result\" and warned that Turkey would launch an offensive into Syria unless Damascus pulled its forces back by the end of the month. He called for Syrian forces to retreat behind Turkey's military posts in Idlib, which were set up under a 2018 deal with Russia designed to hold off a regime advance. The Kremlin quickly responded to Erdogan's threat, warning that any operation against Syrian forces would be \"the worst scenario\". With the Russian-backed offensive, Syrian troops have reconquered swathes of Idlib and retaken the key M5 highway connecting the country's four largest cities as well as the entire surroundings of Aleppo city for the first time since 2012."

      "text": "Sustainable development can be viewed as an integrated agenda and fundamental principle that endeavours to provide solutions to economic, social and environmental challenges. The 2030 Agenda emphasises the need for an inclusive and localised approach to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It states that governments and public institutions will also work closely on implementation with regional and local authorities, sub-regional institutions, international institutions, academia, philanthropic organisations, volunteer groups and others. There is growing awareness, recognition and acknowledgement by the international development community and national governments that the local sphere of government is in the best position to facilitate the mobilisation of local development stakeholders, notably the NGO and private sectors, local communities, and national and international organisations, for attaining inclusive sustainable development within their respective localities. Hence, participatory grassroots local government is indispensable for delivering SDGs particularly in poor and marginalised areas. Local government not only ensures improving access to basic services but provides an effective platform to the poor, peasants, workers and women to participate in decision making and development process undertaken for them. Strengthening local government in rural Bangladesh is perhaps the only viable solution by which government can translate policies into inclusive development and prosperity. Achieving SDGs requires contextualise development priorities and programming while local government is the best fit for implementing policies and programmes for improved service delivery that can address poverty, reduce inequality, climate vulnerability, promote gender equity. Engagement and participation of peasants, workers and women in local government is very important for achieving SDGs in rural areas of Bangladesh and for this purpose the higher polity should compromise their powers and resources by giving more space and representation to marginalised segments of the remote area. Bangladesh has been broadly acclaimed as one of the innovators of MDGs usage. Endeavor of Bangladesh government toward the \"localisation\" of global agendas is progressively expanding to the grassroots level. It is a testimony of the strength of our collective endeavour. This article has examined closely the relationship between SDGs and local government in rural Bangladesh as well as identified the challenges Union Parishad faces to contribute achieving sustainable development goals. SDG 1 This goal takes a multi-dimensional view of poverty and therefore requires multiple, coordinated responses. Local government (LG) can identify people living in poverty on the ground, and target resources and services to help them escape it. LG can play a role in shaping local economic development strategies to create jobs and raise incomes, and by building the resilience of our communities to shocks and disasters. People living in rural Bangladesh are more or less affected by contingencies like unemployment, employment injury, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age, death of the principal bread earner of the family and natural disasters. Such problems are very complex and it is difficult to cope with these. Social security is indispensable to cope with any mishap that may fall upon them at any time in rural Bangladesh. Natural disasters like flood, cyclone, and famine cause many lives and lead to poverty, unemployment, disease etc. Agricultural sector is not sufficient to generate full time employment opportunities for the people in rural Bangladesh. Moreover, disease, disabilities and vulnerabilities of the children, women, and aged population have been major causes of concern in rural Bangladesh. The role of local government is an important element to resolve the existing problems in rural Bangladesh. Union Parishad (UP), the lowest tire of local government, has a few programmes like food for work, old-age allowance, vulnerable group development and so on. All of these programmes generate opportunity for the poor, disabled and vulnerable sections to manage their minimum living requirements. UP also assists old people, widows, divorced women and disabled freedom fighters by providing fixed benefits. SDG 2 Local government manages natural resources in rural areas, particularly land and water and underpins food security for the surrounding territory. LG can support agricultural production and local economic growth by strengthening transport infrastructure and markets to promote local food chains. Rural local government can manage collective resources and reform land tenure in ways that protect the rights of the poorer groups, including secondary right holders. In order to overcome rural developmental challenges, food security is indispensable to cope with any mishap that may befall at any time in rural Bangladesh. The role of social safety net, a dominant component of food security, towards helping communities in any geophysical context of vulnerability is becoming increasingly important. To enhance allocation to maintain a healthy social safety net, efforts must be made significantly. To ensure food security for the rural people in Bangladesh UP is one of the most important units of the central government. SDG 5 This goal is about ending violence and discrimination against women and girls and making sure they have equal opportunities in all areas of life. LG can act as a model for gender equality and the empowerment of women through non-discriminatory service provision to citizens and fair employment practices. LG is on the frontline of identifying and tackling violence and harmful practices against women. LG can facilitate them in terms of empowering women, both as a goal in its own right, and because local politics is often the first step to regional and national office. For achieving meaningful development, women empowerment or participation in governing process through gender sensitive policies are prerequisite in any developing country such as Bangladesh. This particular issue has been recognised in the context of policy reforms in both governmental and local government domains. By responding to local needs, LG plays an influential role in grassroots level development. To ensure women's equal access and increased participation in political power structures, the Local Government (Union Parishad) Second Amendment Act 1997 of Bangladesh can be seen as a great milestone. It gave the structural framework for women's participation in political decision-making. It has also provided an opportunity to bring women to the centre of local development and to develop new grassroots level leadership. But the number of women in elective positions of chairperson and member in the Union Parishad was abysmally low even after three seats were reserved for women candidates, because women elected from reserved seats do not get institutional support and are often not included in mainstream activities, and their responsibilities are sometimes not stated clearly. Even those who are elected as chairperson or general member are often ignored during decision-making only because they are women. On the one hand, Shalish is an ancestral informal dispute resolution mechanism where rural people have easy access to justice regardless of wealth, gender, caste, and religion. Unfortunately, Shalish is also known for unfair decisions based on local power structures and backward norms, as well as draconian enforcement. To bridge the gap between informal and formal dispute resolution, Bangladesh redesigned Shalish through the 2006 Village Courts Act. The village courts aimed to combine the best of Shalish on the one hand (accessibility and effectiveness), and of the formal judicial system on the other (procedural justice). The 2006 act provided for the establishment of a village court in every UP. Informal dispute resolution through village courts has great potential, but marginal and poor sections of rural society in Bangladesh continues to suffer from lack of access to informal justice. Women in particular are struggling to get their voices heard. Access to informal dispute resolution remains one of the core needs of the poor, who cannot afford to gain access to the formal courts. SDG 6 Ensuring access to clean water and sanitation is usually the responsibility of local governments, and relies on effective local governance, natural resource management, and urban planning. LG has a role to play in improving water quality through environmental protection measures and sustainable solid waste management. The rural poor have been more marginalised than the urban poor in getting access to health facilities. Health security for rural people is undermined by the lack of physicians, employees and nurses, misdiagnosis, negligence towards patients, irresponsibility, absenteeism and a lack of professional ethics. Furthermore, although the bulk of the population of Bangladesh lives in rural areas, most doctors are based in cities and towns. Doctors are deterred from serving in the villages due to the absence of proper capacity development, accommodation, quality education, transportation facilities, and the lack of career prospects. UP also struggles to push for improvements due to the scarcity of resources and dynamic leadership. SDG 13 Local and regional governments, especially in cities, are often on the frontline of dealing with the effects of climate change. It is vital that our capacities to deal with climate related hazards and natural disasters are strengthened so that we can protect our communities, particularly the most vulnerable. Local leaders have a history of leading from the bottom up in combatting climate change and of raising awareness at local level. The government of Bangladesh has taken a number of significant steps during the last decades for building up institutional arrangements from national to the union levels for effective and systematic disaster management. For better coordination across level, the Standing Orders on Disaster (SOD) act as a guidebook. Union Disaster Management Committee (UDMC) has been given mandate to act as the rural disaster management entity and it is supposed to play an important role in disaster preparedness, mitigation, emergency response and post disaster rehabilitation. UDMC must ensure that local people are kept informed and capable of taking practical measures for the reduction of risk at household and community level. They will also need to hold hazard, vulnerability and risk analysis at Union level and prepare risk reduction action plan. Unfortunately, local people particularly of vulnerable groups have very limited access to UDMC's meeting deliberations and decisions. This largely signifies that the local vulnerable group members have very limited information about the role, mandates and functioning of the disaster management committee in the ground level. Persons who manage and lead UDMC are not expert in disaster management but the SOD gave them authority to coordinate and manage disaster management efforts. Political leadership at local level is not involved to lead disaster management and therefore, people's interest and sense of accountability are not reflected. SDG 16 This goal calls on local government to become more effective and accountable to our citizens. This requires us to tackle corruption and increase public access to information. For decades, local governments have led the way in experimenting with new forms of participatory decision-making, such as participatory budgeting and planning. This goal calls on us to expand these efforts and become even more responsive to our communities, making sure no group is excluded. UP, the lowest tier of LG, plays a crucial role in strengthening democracy and sustainable development of the rural communities. It is the only institution to ensure good governance, development planning, implementation, transparency, and accountability for rural areas in Bangladesh. The latest Local Government (UP) Act 2009 has created an opportunity to ensure greater participation of the people in the process of development planning and implementation. According to the UP Act, 2009, there is a provision of 13 Standing Committee (SC) in the UP to support the Parishad in ensuring transparency, accountability, and people's participation in planning and implementing for ensuring better governance and service. The committees, comprising elected representatives from the Parishad, civil society members, socially respected persons and women representatives of that locality, are entitled to assist the UP for ensuring better services and resolving different problems. SC helps drive decision and provide an important means of oversight on the function of governing bodies. The reasons behind the sluggish performance of SC may be attributed to a number of factors such as lack of initiatives of UP members, lack of pressure from the common people, lack of political pressure, lack of skills required for planning and implementing development programmes at the local level, no specific terms of references of SC, unwillingness on the part of UP Chairman to delegate authority and even non-existence of SC or existence only on paper. Regrettably, the issue of committees has not been perceived well by different actors who are engaged in the process of functioning of the committees. Ignorance and reluctance appear as impediments for the effectiveness of the committee and low participation of the members in the committee meeting signposts that fruitful discussions are not held in the committee meetings. IN QUEST OF A STRONG LOCAL GOVERNMENT Acknowledging the vital role of local government in the achievement of the SDGs will enable us to mobilise local stakeholders and to create new partnerships, based on a common understanding of our shared humanity. We must remember that, a critical challenge encountered in the early implementation of the MDGs as opposed to the SDGs was the initial lack of grassroots consultation and support and, most importantly, community ownership. Local government must have the means and the capacity to improve administration, anticipate demands, plan and implement solutions. To upscale efforts, we need greater cooperation and national and international coordination mechanisms, as well as enough resources to make this happen. Peer review among local governments has proven to be a very effective way of achieving strengthened local governments. We will need to ensure that citizens are involved in the decisions that affect their future. \"Effective, accountable and transparent institutions\" and \"responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels\" require a clear institutional framework, reinforced management and planning capacities, participatory mechanisms and regular financial negotiations between all levels of government and local communities to define priorities and plan of action. The national government, international institutions, the academic world and our development partners need to foster new partnerships with local political leaders and civil society to facilitate effective decision-making. We must strive to foster dialogue with all stakeholders through the Local 2030 initiative, and to mobilise a multi-level coalition around localisation, which can accelerate our efforts, while setting enabling national frameworks that empower local actors to develop and lead their own strategies aligned with the SDGs. Empowering local government has become imperative for putting rural Bangladesh on the track of inclusive development and prosperity. A strong local government with adequate resources and authority is a must for localisation of SDGs and improved governance at grassroots level.

      "text": "In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, a large number of people have opted for ordering groceries online from the safety of their homes. Customers want to avoid the danger of interacting with people and at the same time, stock up on necessities as people fear a drawn-out self-isolation period until the crisis passes. Home deliveries are considered a safe option. Waseem Alim, co-founder and CEO of Chaldal, an online grocery and delivery platform, says they have been serving 4,000 customers a day in Dhaka through their 350 delivery workers. Such platforms have seen a surge in business in the past weeks. Chaldal has been inundated with orders and has been operating at maximum capacity. Due to this, customers now need to wait for almost a week for their next available slot for delivery. Sabrina Fatema, a resident of Dhanmondi, said she was trying to order a disinfectant item on the site on March 21. The first available slot she found was March 28. Farhana Lubaba, a resident of the Kazipara area of Mirpur, said she had to wait four days to get her order from Shwapno. \"I was expecting that I wouldn't be getting my order anymore. I was surprised to get a phone call from a delivery worker on the fourth day,\" she said. Since more and more people are ordering groceries and other items online since the outbreak, delivery workers have been working tirelessly from morning till night. According to some delivery workers this correspondent interviewed, they would earlier make around 18 to 25 deliveries daily. In the past ten days, they have been doing between 30 and 40 home deliveries a day. \"The situation has changed massively. Now, customers are madly buying online to avoid public gathering at the supershops and bazaars,\" said Md Shaown Hazari, a Chaldal delivery worker. The rise in demand means Arif Hawlader, another Chaldal delivery worker, leaves for work at 7:00am and returns home at 10:00pm. The coronavirus outbreak has also forced delivery workers and customers to maintain cleanliness and hygiene standards in their interactions. Deen Islam Imran of Chaldal is wearing a mask while delivering orders, and sanitising his hands after handling cash. \"Our office has provided safety kits and has been monitoring whether we are strictly maintaining these standards,\" he said. According to Chaldal's CEO, the platform has taken precautions to prevent the risk of the virus passing on to their delivery workers. From March 16, they have formed an internal policy. \"Bike handles, bike seats, and steering wheels should be disinfected with hexisol or Savlon by the respective driver at the beginning of every shift. Deliverymen should maintain a distance of at least one metre from customers when delivering orders,\" mentioned the policy provided by the Chaldal CEO. Supershop Shwapno is also providing hand sanitisers, gloves, and masks for its delivery workers. Delivery and logistics businesses in general have also taken new policies to reduce risks of the virus spreading by giving customers the option of contactless delivery. Pathao, for example, is promoting contactless delivery by dropping off items at doors and asking users to pay digitally. \"We have also taken extra precautions for the safety of users and delivery agents and distributed over 5,000 safety kits to foodmen, couriers, and delivery agents,\" said Syeda Nabila Mahbub, director of marketing and public relations at Pathao. Recently, it also started Pathao Tong service, a shopping service where users could buy daily necessities and get those delivered to their doorsteps, to deliver groceries in Gulshan and Banani. However, contactless delivery is not a standard, as many customers choose to pay cash on delivery. \"It is not possible to avoid contact especially when we need to give change,\" said Arif. In spite of this, riders notice a visible change in customer behaviour. \"Many customers want to make sure that we are wearing masks. Some also offer us handwash or sanitiser before entering their house,\" said Deen. Promi Islam, a Dhanmondi resident, said she keeps a hand sanitiser and deodorant at her door. \"At first, I sanitise the parcel with the deodorant containing alcohol and then we offer hand sanitiser to the deliverymen after they touch our money,\" she said. But the question of the riders' safety still remains. According to the riders, their job involves interacting with a lot of customers every day. \"Most often, we need to enter their house to leave the products. My family worries about whether I end up making deliveries to a home where someone has the virus,\" said a Shwapno delivery worker in the Mirpur area. \"Contactless delivery can be a great way to reduce our risks of being infected, especially in the days to come as we don't know what is going next,\" he stated. \"We have been caring for the customers, and we hope, they too will assist us for the safety of both parties.\""

The immediate purpose of the suspension of classes is to ensure social distancing by discouraging our young ones from physically gathering in a crowded place. The intention to stop the novel coronavirus from spreading is noble. However, in all probability, the moratorium is going to be prolonged, and the end is not in sight. All of a sudden, many working parents do not know what to do with the mischief-making adorable little humans in their houses during the daytime. Many teachers do not know how to compensate for the lost time and finish their lesson plans on time. Many students do not know how to negotiate with this unexpected isolation.    For the most, one thing is certain: it means missing classes altogether. Some of the private universities tried to switch to online platform trialling e-teaching. My institution, ULAB, has been using a learning management system--MOODLE--for the last five years or so. We have mostly used it as a supplementary platform for in-class teaching. In response to the closures, we initiated an emergency management protocol and decided to migrate to e-teaching with an aim of delivering lectures, uploading learning materials, and assessing learning progress online. Our faculty members were enthusiastic; many were pro-active enough to adjust and adopt. The response from our students, however, was an eye-opener. It gave us a rare insight into the psychosocial behaviour of our students as well as the lack of nationwide e-structure to support off-campus online teaching. Our tiny effort is a pebble in the pond, and the waves have reached many shores, exposing a critical gap in our broader education sector that lacks emergency preparedness. The unofficial Facebook page of our university is crowded with comments from students who have gone back to their hometowns or villages where they reportedly do not have regular access to the internet. Many of them do not have PCs, laptops or smartphones. Even if they do, they do not have the speed and bandwidth to connect with a live classroom. They are worried about having uninterrupted power supply during a real-time examination. Printing, scanning a document, uploading assignments within a given time are concerns shared by our students. In our response, we tried to remain flexible, offering both synchronous and asynchronous services in multiple avenues and platforms. At the same time, we have realised that our students are the microcosm of a system that screams inadequacy. I am sure many of the students are presenting the problem as larger than it is to skip exams or classes as they are used to equating closures with vacation. Add to that the genuine resilience against a system that is new. Still our hiccups suggest a mal-digested education system that is currently in place. A survey done in the US shows only nine percent of educators are comfortable in teaching in a completely online environment. One suspects, in our culture, the number is going to be significantly low among those who have been solely exposed to bricks-and-mortar classrooms. For many of the old-school teachers, a virtual classroom where it is difficult to pick up the non-verbal cues of students (e.g. whether they are bored or excited, confused about a topic, shy to ask a question, etc.) robs us of the fun of teaching. Then again, good teaching is good teaching. The challenge for us then is to prepare the course contents in a way so that the human side of a teacher remains intact. Students must feel the warmth of a teacher even while attending a virtual classroom. A teacher can show the warmth by intuitively placing herself/himself in the shoes of the learners, explaining what is expected of a student, and making the learning experience pleasant. Having conducted many teachers' training courses for intermediate and graduate level teachers, I know the banality of my supposition above. Our peripheral schools and colleges are yet to make digital experience central to their pedagogical practices. The ICT in Education Masterplan Review 2019 prepared by Unesco, which is available on the website of the Ministry of Education, may tell you that there has been a significant progress in the incorporation of ICT in classrooms. This simply involves equipping schools with computers and multimedia projectors. Whether they are properly being used is a different issue. While I was teaching the teachers how to make their classes interactive and to apply blended learning, my trainee teachers told me that, in most cases, the projectors in their institutions were locked in the rooms of the principals. A teacher can issue the equipment at her/his own risk, giving written assurances that she/he will be responsible for any damage as the institutions do not have any maintenance budget. This is symbolic of how our digital progress is contained. The equipment lies in a box, nipping any possibility of thinking-out-of-the-box in its bud.   When students from these institutions come to the tertiary system, particularly to places where student-centred active learning is practiced, they find it difficult to cope with the changes and challenges. The recent aversion to digital classrooms made me reflect on the contextual background. What is even more alarming is the fact that there is an absolute lack of preparedness to deal with crisis management in the education sector. All the directives so far involve health and safety related issues. There are no official directives regarding the safeguarding of the education of our future generation in a prolonged crisis scenario. Hence, immediate guidance is needed for the clueless teachers, students and parents so that they can prepare for educational continuity. Similar guidance is needed so that psychosocial support can be made available to both teachers and students during long-term out-of-school closures. Education is not only transmission of knowledge from educators to learners; it is related to the holistic growth and wellbeing of the individuals concerned. Education shapes one's personalities, one's attitudes towards life, and makes one a social being. How we do that in a virtual setting (better not to confuse with social media) is a \"koti taka\" question! We need a plan for strategic interventions--a national contingency plan for the education sector which may go beyond fire drilling or natural disasters. The existing Bangladesh Emergency Response Plan 2014 and a follow-up SOD simply include guidelines for the aftermath of flood, cyclones or earthquakes. The pandemonium ensued by the pandemic has given rise to new concerns. Long-term social distancing, self-isolation is not only a probability but a reality. Migrating to the online teaching platform can be a logical step. Countries such as Syria, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and the Philippines have earlier adopted flexible distance learning to deal with war-time emergency. Maybe the time has come for us to educate ourselves and brace ourselves against the new dangers that may not wear a crown; they may appear in the shape of climate change or in some other formats where we will need to relearn everything that we have learned so far. And that day is not far, yet we are far away from being ready for it.   Shamsad Mortuza is a Professor of English, University of Dhaka (now on leave). Currently, he is Pro-Vice-Chancellor of ULAB.

      "text": "Inclement weather. Lack of buyers. Shortage of workers. And impending flashfloods. These very real developments, coupled with a belief that prices of their harvest are set to fall, have Boro farmers in Sylhet's haor region looking down the barrel. The government-declared stimulus package and assurances of buying up a huge amount of paddy and rice, which are meant to help, also ring hollow to many farmers. They are yet to see the benefit of the injection and are also worried about the strictness in maintaining the maximum humidity paddy is allowed to have. Benu Chandra Sarkar, a marginal farmer of Sukhair village of Dharmapasha upazila in Sunamganj, said, \"The weather is not favourable for harvesting paddy as the sky remains cloudy all day and it's raining periodically. If such weather continues, we will not be able to dry the paddy properly to sell to the government.\" There are also concerns that only a lucky few would be able to sell to the government. The government has decided to buy 54,278 tonnes from Sylhet division, but this is 2.10 percent of the production. Additionally, the paddy's maximum humidity has been set at 14 percent. While previously this was relaxed for haor farmers, it is not the case this time around. \"I do not want to sell paddy to the government as is not possible to maintain the humidity in this current weather,\" said Rahim Uddin, a farmer of Moulvibazar's Kulaura upazila. Meanwhile, in the haor region, paddy collectors (middleman), who used to work for large businesses, visited farmlands and made contracts with farmers before harvest. They even paid some money beforehand, which was used to hire workers and when drying the paddy. But this year, no such middlemen can be seen, farmers said. Sadek Miah, a paddy buyer of the area, said, \"This year large businesses are not interested to pay before and we are not sure what to do.\" Somor Biswas, a farmer of Kulaura upazila in Moulvibazar, said, \"More buyers would mean increased prices. But this year the price will collapse, I think.\" The department of agriculture extension (DAE) in Sylhet division has estimated 25,83,115 tonnes of cultivation this year as Boro harvest begun last week. But, till Friday, only 5 percent of the Boro had been harvested, according to the Sylhet DAE. Early rainfall and the possible flash flood forecasted by the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre of Bangladesh Water Development Board recently added to the farmers' fears. All this comes amidst a shortage of workers due to the ongoing shutdown over the coronavirus pandemic. Mohammad Monsur, a farmer from Barlekha upazila in Moulvibazar, said, \"I used to bring in workers from different areas but it's become impossible to bring them due to the nationwide shutdown\". \"I even contacted local workers, but they are already demanding more than Tk 500 per day, which was previously Tk 300-400 taka. If the cost increases, it would be hard to make profit by selling paddy,\" he said. To solve this, the government earlier declared a subsidy of 50 percent when buying harvesters and reapers, making the process more capital- than labour-intensive. Moreover, as per the instruction from the Ministry of Agriculture, the farmers can also get instalment facilities in buying them. But marginal farmers and even the well-off ones are balking at the still costly machines, especially given the sudden financial crisis everyone is finding themselves in. Joglul Haider, upazila agriculture officer of Kulaura upazila in Moulvibazar, said, \"A combine harvester costs around taka 28 lakhs. Even if the government provide 50 percent subsidy, no farmers have enough money to buy it in this upazila\". Debol Sarkar, upazila agriculture officer of Barlekha upazila in Mouvibazar, also said, no farmer of the upazila shows interest to buy any harvester Talking about Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's announcement of Tk 5,000 crore stimulus package for farmers, Shabbir Miah, a farmer from Kulaura upazila in Moulvibazar, said, \"We saw that on TV, but we are not getting anything...\" Amid the gloom, however, some are still holding out for a ray of hope. Abdul Jalil, a farmer from Chhatak upazila in Sunamganj, said, \"I see good harvest this year, hope for good weather in coming days and a good price during this crisis.\" Srinibash Debnath, additional director of the department of agriculture extension in Sylhet, said, \"This year, the harvest seems very good. We are up for a very good yield.\" He also said many initiatives are being undertaken to support farmers and those will become visible in the coming days."

      "text": "Long despised by German fans as the face of big-money football, billionaire Dietmar Hopp is now being held up by some as a national hero in the coronavirus crisis. Three weeks ago, the 79-year-old owner of the Hoffenheim club was the subject of nationwide protests in Germany's stadiums, with fans calling him a \"son of a b***h\" and holding up pictures of his face in crosshairs. This week, Hopp raised hopes of a vaccine for the COVID-19 disease, suggesting a company he owns could develop one as soon as the autumn. Ranked by Forbes as the eighth richest person in Germany, Hopp made his fortune with SAP, a software company he co-founded in 1972. Decades later, he used his wealth to propel Hoffenheim, based near Sinsheim in southwestern Germany, from amateur league anonymity to the top-flight Bundesliga and a place among Europe's elite in the Champions League. That made him a hate figure for football fans across the country. For Germany's \"ultras\", Hopp is a symbol for how wealthy investors hold too much power in football. They see him as a threat to the culture and traditions of the German game, and more specifically to the 50+1 rule, which underpins the considerable influence of supporters in the way German clubs are run. Hopp has also riled fans by taking legal action over insulting chants sung about him by away supporters. A decision by the German Football Association to ban Borussia Dortmund fans from Hoffenheim for two years prompted a flood of protests last month, with fans across the country accusing football authorities of pandering to Hopp's personal wishes. Supporters of clubs such as Bayern Munich, Borussia Moenchengladbach and Union Berlin held up banners insulting Hopp and the DFB, leading in some cases to games being suspended. Three weeks on, the Bundesliga has been suspended due to the coronavirus crisis, but Hopp remains firmly in the headlines. He is now being heralded as a hero in some quarters, after it emerged that one of his companies, biotech firm CureVac, is working on a vaccine for COVID-19. CureVac's research was at the centre of a diplomatic row last weekend. According to a report in Welt newspaper on Sunday, US President Donald Trump offered the company up to a billion dollars to secure exclusive rights to the vaccine research for the United States. CureVac denied the report, while Hopp said such a deal \"would not be an option\". \"It's obvious for me that it can't be the case that a German company develops a vaccine which is then used exclusively in the US.\" The firm response earned him praise but football fans remain largely unmoved by Hopp's comments on the vaccine, which he says should be for \"people across the world\". \"It's very nice that a successful businessman is recognising his social responsibility and acting accordingly, but that has nothing to do with his involvement in football,\" said Sig Zelt, a spokesman for the organisation \"Pro-Fans\", on Wednesday."

      "text": "Construction and renovation work of an important road in Basail upazila could not be completed even after eight months of its stipulated deadline due to alleged negligence of the contractor concerned. Due to the delay, thousands of inhabitants of several villages in Basail and adjacent two upazilas -- Sakhipur and Mirzapur -- are suffering immensely for long. According to the data provided by Local Government and Engineering Department (LGED) in Basail, the six-kilometre-long road stretching from Kanchanpur to Dhangpara via Pathatghata has remained unusable for locals and unfit for vehicular movement. In a bid to ease the public sufferings, LGED floated a tender for construction and renovation work of the road at a costs of 5.59 crores. Contractor firm Bishal Enterprise got the work order and started the work on April 30, 2018.   Mentionable, although the works were supposed to be completed by May 6, 2019, it still remain incomplete even after eight months of its actual deadline. During a recent visit to the area this correspond saw construction materials lying scattered beside the under construction road in Dhangpara, Jotuki, Poulee, Haluapara and Sankapara area while construction materials did not even reached in many areas. Saiful Islam of Kanchanpur village said they have been facing lots of trouble due to the shabby condition of the road and huge amount of dust in the air. \"We did not saw the contractor concerned at the construction site yet,\" he alleged. Accidents often occur while travelling on the damaged road, Mohammad Ali of the area said. \"As the road is not suitable for vehicular movements local traders suffer immensely while carrying their goods,\" trader Shafiqul Islam said.  \"We have to move on foot as transports are not available due to the bad condition of the road,\" housewife Protima Rani said.  Basail Upazila Parishad Chairman Kazi Alid Islam said the road repair work was in full swing till the beginning of the rainy season, but suddenly it stopped. \"I hope the work will complete in a short time and local people will be benefited from it,\" he added. Basail LGED Upazila Engineer Rozdid Ahmed said about 45 percent of the total work has already been completed and they have served notice to the contractor concerned for completing the work by June this year. Mohammad Hossain, owner of Bishal Enterprise, said they could not continue the work as they were unable to carry the construction materials at many sites due to the recent flood.     \"We hope to complete the work within the next couple of months,\" he added."

The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) accepted the new proposal during a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the NEC conference room in the capital's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar yesterday. The project, which was initially estimated to cost Tk 128.81 crore, received the green light on March 22 in 2016 with construction expected to last from July 2015 to June 2018. The third revision was made to accommodate changes in layout, incorporate new components, lengthen the project's duration and re-estimate the civil work costs. The first revision saw costs increase by 2.27 per cent to Tk 131.74 crore and the second revision maintained the estimated expenditure while the project's duration was extended by a year. As of June 2019, the BSCIC spent Tk 87.23 crore, or 66.21 per cent of the cost. Some of the major activities to be undertaken for the project are the acquisition of 50 acres land, construction of a two-storey building, a pump house and pump driver quarter, entry gate and boundary wall, and setting up of a deep tube-well and water pipeline. The project is expected to create 5,000 jobs. The meeting also approved the expansion and modernisation of the Amin Bazar landfill at a cost of Tk 786.26 crore. The Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) will implement the project, for which development will begin in July 2020 and end in June 2023. Under the accepted scheme, the DNCC will set up new landfill sites, incineration plants and infrastructural facilities on 80 acres of land for the resource recovery and disposal of medical waste. The DNCC will also develop an environment-friendly and hygienic way to collect, transport and dump waste materials. At the resource recovery facilities, wastes will be recycled to produce biogas and organic fertilisers. The ECNEC also approved five more projects: emergency water supply; widening and strengthening of the Sheikhpara (Jhenaidah)-Shoilakupa-Langalbandh (Shreepur)-Wapda district highways; protecting the right bank of the Jamuna river from Munshiganj to Khanpura and Kazirhat to Rajdardia of Bera upazila of Pabna; protecting the left and right banks of the Dharala river, including flood control in Kurigram sadar, Rajarhat and Fulbari upazila; and protecting the Padma river from erosion in Charbagdanga and Shajahanpur in Chapainawabganj district."

      "text": "Thousands of people have begun to leave Dhaka for their village homes ahead of Eid, ignoring the risks of contracting coronavirus and spreading it to many others. There were so many people on the ferries on the Padma yesterday that the authorities, in a bid to prevent crowding, suspended the services on Shimulia-Kathalbari and Paturia-Daulatdia routes for hours. In the absence of public transport because of the ongoing shutdown, the holiday-makers travelled by pickups, motorcycles and battery-run three wheelers. Many had to spend two to three times the usual fare. The Dhaka-Chattogram highway witnessed a 25-km tailback in Daudkandi, caused mainly by thousands of cars leaving Dhaka. The Covid-19 outbreak had hit Dhaka and its adjacent areas the hardest in the country. Experts said this rush of thousands of people will further spread the deadly virus and delay the reopening process. After observing the crowds that have been getting bigger for the last few days, the Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity in a statement yesterday urged the government to announce a 10-day curfew around the Eid to slow the spread of the outbreak. Around three crore people used to leave Dhaka and other major cities ahead of Eid, it said. And many people have started leaving the cities for their hometowns this week. The shutdown began on March 26 and the government later extended it six times. Before May 30, most of the private and public offices will not reopen and transport services will not resume. In a circular on May 14, the cabinet division said movement of people will be restricted from May 17-May 28 across the country. The circular also said that no one would be allowed to leave the city where they work. The local administration and law enforcers were supposed to enforce the restrictions during the period. Police on Sunday stepped up measures to restrict the movement of people. They set up check posts across the country to prevent people from travelling from one district to another during Eid unless there is an emergency. But the number of people leaving Dhaka increased yesterday. Eid-ul-Fitr will be celebrated on May 24 or 25, subject to the sighting of the moon. CROWDING AT FERRY TERMINALS The number of people leaving Dhaka has been increasing since Friday, a day after the government announced the extension of the Eid holidays. Ferry operators on the Shimulia-Kathalbari route said they have been transporting several thousand people across the Padma every day this week. The authorities reduced the number of ferries from 14 to just four early yesterday to prevent crowding. But from 6:00am to 10:00am, the operators had to carry only people across the river, because there was no room for vehicles, said an employee. As the day progressed and the crowd became larger, the authorities suspended the services around 3:00pm. The services did not resume as of 9:00pm. Ferry terminal staffers said there were thousands of people there. At Paturia and Daulatdia terminals, the situation was similar. As the number of small vehicles increased in the last few days, the authorities stopped transporting small vehicles from 11:00pm on Sunday, Zillur Rahman, BIWTC deputy general manager at the terminal, told this newspaper. When the number of small vehicles like cars kept rising, they stopped operation of all five ferries from 11:00am yesterday, he said. \"We will resume operation after getting permission from higher authorities and will only carry goods-laden vehicles now.\" Rifat Rahman Shamim, superintendent of police in Manikganj, said police were struggling to control the movement of people. Police on Sunday set up a check-post at Golra on Dhaka-Aricha highway in Manikganj, he told our Manikganj correspondent. But people have been reaching Paturia Ghat at night, using bypass roads, he added. The terminals witnessed similar crowds when the government on March 23 announced the shutdown from March 26. DHAKA-CTG HIGHWAY The long tailback from Eliotganj to Daudkandi took shape yesterday morning. The situation became normal around 4:00pm. As the number of private vehicles increased, police intensified their checking activities, causing the gridlock, reports our Cumilla correspondent. Abdullah Al Mamun, officer in charge of Daudkandi Highway Police Station, said they have been working to maintain the \"lockdown\" strictly. Vehicles carrying goods and emergency transports were only allowed to move towards Dhaka. Lorry driver Shafikul Islam, however, said when police forced the cars to return to Dhaka, they caused the jam. WHAT HEALTH EXPERTS SAY Prof Dr Shah Monir Hossain, one of the eight members of a government-formed expert committee to supervise, monitor and support the coronavirus response, said: \"It's clear indication that we are going towards a worse situation. \"In a nutshell, I can tell you that the way people... are returning to their village homes.... we are heading towards a more serious crisis.\" The government should immediately take measures to stop the flood of people leaving Dhaka, he added. Prof Muzaherul Huq, former World Health Organisation regional adviser for Southeast Asia, said, \"I think the death rate from coronavirus may increase if the government fails to prevent people from going to their homes. \"We are yet to know who tested positive or negative for Covid-19. That's why a sea of people, especially from the hotspots, going back to their villages, poses serious risks to others,\" he said.

      "text": "Cyclone Amphan was gaining pace in the Bay yesterday and may hit Bangladesh coast near the Sundarbans in the early hours of tomorrow, the met office warns. With a wind speed of up to 245kmph, Amphan was located 940km off the coast at 9:00pm yesterday. It was formed in the Bay of Bengal on Saturday. Weathermen fear that if it does not weaken before hitting the coast, it could be as devastating as Cyclone Sidr. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the cyclone may come as a double blow to disadvantaged people in the coastal regions. Many of them are reluctant to go to cyclone shelters as they are worried about protecting whatever little resources they have left. \"Along with the existing 4,071 permanent shelters, we have already prepared another 1,278, where around 51 lakh people could be accommodated. But with the coronavirus situation in mind, we will ensure maintaining social distance among the people,\" Dr Md Enamur Rahman, state minister for disaster management and relief, told The Daily Star yesterday. If somebody does not want to go to cyclone shelters, law enforcers will have to force them to leave vulnerable areas, he said. These shelters are located in 19 coastal districts under Khulna, Barishal and Chattogram divisions. The ministry has allocated 3,100 metric tons of rice, Tk 50 lakh in cash, Tk 31 lakh for children's food, Tk 28 lakh for fodders for livestock to support the people on the coastal belt during their stay at the shelters. \"From our experience after Cyclone Bulbul and Foni, we can say it takes seven to eight hours to evacuate 20 lakh people from their homes and take them to the shelters,\" the state minister said. Law enforcement agencies will help people living on chars and in island areas and bring them to the mainland today. Volunteers were using loudspeakers and urging people to move to the shelters, reports our correspondents from Khulna and Barishal divisions. Already more than two thousand people have moved to cyclone shelters in Satkhira's Gabura. Zohora Khatun, 60, a survivor of Sidr, which killed over four thousand people in Bangladesh, moved to Chadnimukh MM High School yesterday afternoon. \"We have moved here after hearing the announcement about the cyclone on loudspeaker,\" she said over telephone yesterday evening. Many, however, don't want to leave their houses, leaving behind their livestock and poultry, while others complained that the shelters were in bad condition. Imtiaz Uddin, a fisherman of Dakkhin Bedkashi village in Koyra upazila, told The Daily Star that they were the most vulnerable and affected people in any cyclone due to poor embankment. \"If I leave home and go to a shelter, where will my two cows and 10 ducks go? The cyclone shelter is two and a half kilometers away from my home,\" said Imtiaz, a survivor of Sidr and Aila, two severe cyclones that hit the Bangladesh coast in 2007 and 2008. \"My wife and mother will go to the shelter tomorrow [today] if this cyclone is that bad or if any instructions come from the administration,\" he said. Uttam Mondal, of Sutorkhali village in Dacope upazila, told The Daily Star that people of the village usually do not go to shelters due to their poor environment. \"Almost all shelters are dilapidated and most of the windows and gates are damaged. Very few locals go to shelters,\" said Uttam, adding that there is no privacy for women there either. \"If any major crisis comes, I will go to the shelter with my father,\" he said. Over 50,000 people in Patuakhali's coastal area are fearing a sudden surge due to the storm and that some area like Charipara, Kuakata, Lotachapli and Dulsar under Kolapara upazila may be submerged. Around a 500-kilometer-long embankment built to protect those areas has been damaged and its repair work is still going on. \"The flood protection dam has been damaged in our area. We fear that water will come rushing through this breach of the dam. And our whole village may go under water,\" said Abdur Rahim of Charipara village. Several hundred people on that remote island of Dhalchar have already been evacuated. \"In the district, there are 21 risky remote islands, on which around three lakh people are living. Most of them don't want to go to the cyclone shelters. But we will try to bring in as many as possible [to the shelters],\" said Mohammed Masud Alam Siddique, deputy commissioner of Bhola. GETTING CLOSER Amphan, a Thai word meaning ambition or strength, was located 940km southwest from Payra, 955km southwest from Mongla, 990km away from Cox's Bazar and 1,045km from Chattogram at 9:00pm yesterday. \"If it does not weaken before making the landfall, it could be worse than Cyclone Sidr,\" said Samarendra Karmakar, a retired director of the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. Currently, the wind speed is between 225km to 245km. In its special bulletin, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department said the cyclone may intensify further and may cross Bangladesh coast between Khulna and Chattogram early tomorrow, which could, however, be delayed to tomorrow evening. The sea will remain very high near the eye of the cyclone, the bulletin said. The met office asked the Chattogram and Cox's Bazar port authorities to hoist signal number six, while Mongla and Payra port authorities were asked to hoist signal number seven, which means those ports will experience a severe storm. The coastal districts of Satkhira, Khulna, Bagerhat, Jhalakathi, Pirojpur, Barguna, Patuakhali, Bhola, Barishal, Laxmipur, Chandpur, Noakhali, Feni, Chattogram and their shore islands and chars will suffer the worst of the storm, while low-lying areas of those districts could be inundated. All fishing boats have been asked to take immediate shelter until further notice. (Our correspondents from Khulna, Barishal, Bhola, Patuakhali, Bagerhat, Pirjojpur and Noakhali contributed to the report.)"

Despite all these efforts, quality services remain elusive, as city dwellers continue to suffer from perennial problems such as traffic jam and waterlogging. Latest on the list is the outbreak of mosquito-borne diseases, dengue and chikungunya. In fact, Dhaka has been one of the 10 worst liveable cities in the Economist Intelligence Unit's index for several years now. But what factors stand in the way of the city authorities' success? Is it overpopulation? Resource constraints? Or is it something else?   If we look at Kolkata, it has improved leaps and bounds in terms of delivering civic services, since the Kolkata Municipality Corporation started its journey under Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act, 1984.  At the time, Kolkata (or Calcutta, as it was known back then) happened to be a city where garbage was dumped anywhere on the streets. Load shedding and power outages were frequent, traffic condition was horrendous and its air used to reek of garbage, according to those who lived and visited the city in the 1980s. But now, one would be hard-pressed to find garbage on the roads -- that remain illuminated with adequate street lights after the evening. Most streets are free of potholes, and today's Kolkata is no longer the city of traffic jams it used to be. So what makes the West Bengal capital different from Dhaka? Experts point out that the city corporations in Dhaka have little to do when it comes to governance, and the confusion over jurisdictions of utility service providers are a major obstacle to their success. The city is in fact managed by about four dozen government agencies -- aside from the mayoral offices -- which were set up under different acts and now belong to various ministries. The city corporations have no control over Dhaka Metropolitan Police, Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority (Wasa), Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) and the authorities that supply power and gas. City dwellers often suffer because of the failure of the agencies to deliver in line with their expectations. Also, a lack of coordination among them leaves the city's development and maintenance in a mess. But both urban local government bodies -- DSCC and DNCC -- are powerless to do anything towards that end. Mayors have in the past expressed frustration over inadequate jurisdiction to better serve city dwellers. For instance, the city corporation authorities cannot make a master plan or take any drastic measures to address the waterlogging problem, because at least seven other agencies, including Wasa, are tasked with maintaining the drainage. Yet, whenever the city goes under water, it is the mayors who take the heat of public criticism. \"It's a faulty governance system for which the city people are suffering,\" said Tofail Ahmed, a local government expert. He observed that there are a number of service-providing organisations, but none of them takes responsibility for failure to serve people. Apart from the lack of coordination, the mayor holds all the executive powers in the existing system, and councillors do not have any specific functions and jurisdiction, he added. On the other hand, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has emerged as a truly autonomous body that is directly responsible to the electorate. It performs both obligatory and discretionary functions. The obligatory functions include providing civic services like water supply, sewerage and drainage, solid waste management, town planning and land use control, and construction and maintenance of streets. The discretionary functions include establishment of primary schools, setting up theatres and cinemas for public entertainment, and hospitals, dispensaries and clinics for healthcare. To provide adequate services for its people, Kolkata adapted the model of cabinet form of city government styled \"mayor-in-council\", in which the mayor is the head of the city government. A councillor who commands the support of the majority of councillors is elected mayor. The mayor appoints and leads a council, called mayor-in-council. Each member holds portfolios of various functional departments and is responsible to the corporation for their functions. \"Except some activities, the corporation has the sole authority to undertake any project to serve its citizens,\" Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, former mayor of KMC, told The Daily Star. \"KMC is a fully independent and autonomous body. It is not dependent on others. That's why the corporation is serving its citizens well.\" The mayor and councillors are accountable in different tiers, which ensure better services, said Bikash -- who was the mayor of KMC from 2005 to 2010. Subrata Mookherjee, another former mayor of KMC, said development activities in his city has gained huge pace soon after it became a municipal corporation. Subrata also said they follow the parliamentary form, which gives life to the activities of the corporation. \"No organisation except a few exceptions can do anything in the municipal corporation area,\" he said. He also said if any other organisation wants to do any work in the corporation area, that organisation has to coordinate with the corporation. Experts back home suggest the introduction of a metropolitan government for Dhaka to overcome the present crisis. The idea of such a government -- to bring major civic service providers under one authority -- was first floated by Mohammad Hanif, Dhaka's first elected mayor, in 1994. Sadek Hossain Khoka, a senior BNP leader who was mayor of the undivided Dhaka City Corporation from 2002 to 2011, also supported the idea of a metropolitan government. The metropolitan government would be headed by the mayor and all essential government services and development organisations relating to the city, such as DMP and Wasa, will be under its jurisdiction. The metropolitan government would also be entrusted with functions relating to telephone, fire-fighting services, education, health, land, environment, social welfare, women and children affairs, family planning, flood control, transportation, etc. But Hanif did not get a positive response from his own party, Awami League, which led the government between 1996 and 2001. Similarly, Khoka did not get any feedback on it from his party which was in office from 2001 to 2006. Noted architect and town planner Mubasshar Hussein said the idea of metropolitan is not being implemented due to bureaucratic tangles. \"In Dhaka, a mayor can change the bulb of a lamppost, but cannot take any decision about the post,\" he said, as an example. When the Bangladesh Railway authorities have a separate police unit, why doesn't the city corporation have any police of its own, he asked. Similar geos for traffic situation, he said, adding that the city mayors will not be able to reduce traffic jam until they get their own police or until traffic police come under the mayor's jurisdiction.

His father, renowned artist Rasidun Nabi (1914-1995), was a police officer. \"My father used to paint under the light of lanterns every night, after returning from office. He was an honest man,\" said an emotional Rafiqun Nabi at the opening ceremony of the group art exhibition Parampara, currently underway at Gallery Chitrak. Prominent artist Mustafa Monwar inaugurated the exhibition as the chief guest. The exhibition features exquisite artworks of Rasidun Nabi, and his three sons -- celebrated artist Rafiqun Nabi, eminent photographer Tauhidun Nabi, and famous artist Rezaun Nabi along with his daughter-in-law, artist Sohana Shahreen. \"My father was close to many pioneering artists of Bangladesh, including Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin. In 1954, when I was in the fourth grade, he took me to the All Pakistan National Art Exhibition held at Burdhawan House (Now Bangla Academy), as a way of inspiring me to take up art,\" shared Rafiqun Nabi. \"During that time, a heavy flood inundated Dhaka and some foreign aid agencies distributed food, along with story and rhyme books and watercolour bars. My father coloured many paintings during that time.\" Rasidun Nabi's compositions range from beautiful landscapes to portraits, boats, rivers, humans, birds, woods and animals. He painted with pencil, ink, watercolour and mixed-media, depicting images of boats, village sceneries, unidentified gypsies, palm trees, horses and women. He also created clay and cork sheet sculptures. Two sculptures with marvelous paintings of Rasidun Nabi are on display at the gallery.  \"The artists of today boast of merit. Art is not done with talent - It is created from the heart. I believe that nature is the biggest teacher, when it comes to art. Rasidun Nabi was inspired by nature,\" said Mostafa Monwar. \"That's why he was able to teach his children, who are carrying his artistic legacy forward.\"  \"Rasidun Nabi painted magnanimously themed paintings with dedication. The paintings and photographs that are now hung on the walls of the gallery are not just works of art - they showcase a family's legacy,\" said Hashem Khan, the guest of honour at the event.  Professor Bulban Osman, who presided over the opening ceremony of Parampara, expressed his gratitude to the Nabi family. \"Rasidun Nabi saw my father, litterateur Shawkat Osman and my name in the list of the then Pakistani forces,\" he said. \"He shared this information with his wife. As a responsible police officer, he was in a dilemma of professional integrity and patriotism. But he prioritised patriotism. That's why we survived on that day.\" Parampara, opening from 10 am to 8 pm daily, will conclude on February 29."

      "text": "At a time when the government is engaged in the multifarious activities involved in crisis management during the ongoing pandemic, it is encouraging to learn that the non-government organisations (NGOs) are emphasising their eagerness to share their expertise and experience with the government to help in tackling the crisis too. Various alliances of NGOs have expressed this at a virtual press conference recently. There is no doubt that these organisations can significantly help the government in its fight against Covid-19. With their widespread presence at the grassroots level, NGOs have been working alongside the government during times of disaster for decades. And such collaborative measures have proven successful in various aspects. Moreover, the presence of the surging cases of dengue, along with the approaching flood season, will surely weigh heavy on the crisis and make matters more challenging in the days to come. Thus, a collaborative means of preparedness between the government and NGOs will help ease some of the suffering during such times. With hands-on experience in dealing with vulnerable groups and disaster management, among others, NGOs can be involved in various spheres of operations--from helping farmers save their crops to the distribution of relief and much more. Furthermore, with government assistance, micro-finance NGOs can also operate to help boost rural economic activities as the moderately poor are entering the bracket of the ultra-poor. NGOs can also assist in implementing the activities at the core level under the government stimulus package declared to tackle Covid-19 impacts. The possibilities are many and will prove promising once the collaborative efforts are put into practice. It is to be noted that people's lives and health are at stake here, not to mention the adverse economic impact on the entire nation. The government should therefore take advantage of this opportunity to involve NGOs and their human resources to tackle the Herculean task that looms. Needless to say, during these challenging times, people's wellbeing in terms of health and the economic situation should be kept above all other considerations. The government should take all the help it can get."

People of some 100 villages in Kullagara and Gaukandia unions have been suffering for years for want of a bridge on the river at Birisiri point in the upazila. Especially schoolchildren and critical patients are the worst sufferers due to the communication problem. The villages include Ranikhong, Khujiura, Kullagara, Shasharpar, Gaukandia, Dhanipara, Boheratoli, Charpara, Boroikandi, Jagotkura, Chhondhara and Maizpara. Shubra Sangma, chairman of Kullagara Union Parishad (UP), said as there is no bridge in the area, the lease holders of Birisiri Ferry Ghat made the 500-metre-long wooden bridge in November last year for the first time. It took around 15 days to complete construction of the bridge. Earlier, the villagers had to face various trouble to reach the upazila and district headquarters but the bridge will now ease their sufferings during the dry season, said Shubra Sangma, adding that motorcycles and CNG-run auto-rickshaws can also ply the bridge.  Some 20 years ago, a fund was sanctioned for construction of a concrete bridge at the point but the authorities concerned are yet to take any steps to build a bridge there, said the UP chairman.  At least the makeshift wooden bridge has brought a sort of relief to thousands of commuters, he said. Each person has to pay around Tk 10 to cross the bridge, said local people. Md Bakul Mia, a toll collector of the ferry ghat, said they made the makeshift bridge at a cost of Tk 7 lakh to ease longstanding sufferings of people in the villages. Mohammd Al Amin, a resident of Dakhhin Bhawanipur village, said \"The wooden bridge will be used for four months from December to March and during monsoon, we have to use engine-run boats to cross the river.\" Villagers aid during the rainy season, it becomes difficult for them to cross the area due to strong current in the river. The situation worsens when hilly waters from across the border flood the area. \"Due to lack of easy communications, the villages are separated from the Durgapur upazila headquarters. The areas are still underdeveloped due to poor communication system\", said Rasel Mia, a student of Susang Durgapur Government College. During the rainy season, the problem turned so serious and they have to cross the river on boat amid risk of accident, said Sanjida Akter, an HSC examinee from the same college. Nazrul Islam, a farmer of Bhawanipur village, said the people of the area are mainly dependent on agriculture, but they are facing serious problems to bring their produces to the markets of the town for years for want of a permanent bridge at the point. Talking to this correspondent, Executive Engineer of Roads and Highways Department in Netrakona Didarul Alam Tarafder said they are doing feasibility studies for construction of 870-metre-long concrete bridge on the river at Birisiri point."

They said NGOs, which have their presence at the grassroots level and always worked hand in hand with the government in disaster management, should be incorporated in the activities for stronger coordination and greater reach. The suggestions came at a virtual press conference hosted by COAST Trust and attended by the leaders of different alliances of NGOs -- National Alliance of Humanitarian Actors, Bangladesh (NAHAB), Bangladesh CSO-NGO Coordination Process, Network for Information, Response and Preparedness Activities on Disaster (NIRAPA), Disaster Forum, Association of Development Agencies Bangladesh (ADAB) and Federation of NGOs Bangladesh (FNB). \"The season of flood, cyclone and dengue is upcoming. With any of these taking place alongside the Covid-19 pandemic, the situation will be grave. So, we need to be prepared,\" said ADAB Director AKM Jashim Uddin. He said the government has announced stimulus packages and is providing relief materials, but there are already many allegations of irregularities. If the actual target people are not listed for the benefits, the government assistance is not going to work effectively. \"Food production is going to be a major task. So, ensuring that incentives reach farmers and that they can harvest Boro paddy before going for Aush is very important.\" Jasim Uddin also said the micro-finance NGOs are now passing tough days, with all their money in the hands of their members who are now unable to pay the installments during the shutdown. He sought government financing for the restart of microfinance operations to help boost rural economic activities. Nurul Alam Masud, chief executive of Participatory Research & Action Network, said the government is considering Covid-19 only a health issue, and until now only the administration and some partisan people are being involved in tackling it. \"The government should now activate the Disaster Management Act, involve the NGOs at national and grassroots levels for strong coordination and transparency,\" he added. Nayeem Gawher Wahra, member secretary of Disaster Forum, said shutdown is likely to remain in place for some more days, but the economic activities and food production need to continue under certain mechanism. Citing the example of Kerala, he said the government could divide the geographical areas in some categories and allow certain level of economic activities in the green zone. He said health awareness exists mostly among the urban and middle class people, not the grassroots. He suggested using community radio as an effective tool  to create mass awareness on social distancing and hygiene. Abul Haseeb Khan of NIRAPAD said the government assistance has yet to reach many remote areas and availability of food is becoming an issue of concern. With no income, moderate poor are getting into the bracket of ultra poor. Independent researcher Abdul Latif Khan said UN agencies and INGOs should limit their role to monitoring and providing technical assistance to the local NGOs. And they should provide direct funding to the national and local NGOs as localisation should be promoted to increase cost efficiency amid this global crisis when the developed countries too are affected. He suggested the government involve NGOs and civil society organisations in implementing the activities at the grassroots level under the government stimulus package declared to tackle Covid-19 impacts. \"To face the post-corona crisis, the rural economy must continue with their production maintaining the social distancing and local NGOs and micro finance institutions should be allowed for operation as they are the key players in this regard,\" he said. Latif suggested increased focus on stronger health system in the rural areas. Rezaul Karim Chowdhury of COAST Trust moderated the press conference."

The birthday of the father of the nation coincides with the arrival of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in Bangladesh. Indira Gandhi presents fruits and sweets to Bangabandhu on his birthday. The day begins with special prayers held at the city mosques, temples, pagodas and churches wishing Bangabandhu good health and a long, happy life. Awami League volunteer corps present a guard of honour to the prime minister at his residence in the early morning. The city newspapers, in their Friday supplements, carry special articles and features on the life and activities of Bangabandhu. Bangladesh Television telecasts an interview of Bangabandhu's parents on this special occasion. When Bangabandhu was in prison in Pakistan, his colleagues in Bangladesh government had declared this day a public holiday. But Bangabandhu in a statement says that he doesn't think March 17 should be a holiday in the future. He however adds that March 17 this year shall be observed as a public holiday as a token of love and admiration for the great prime minister of India, Sreemati Indira Gandhi. Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi today flies into Dhaka to a hearty welcome carrying messages of goodwill and friendship of the people of India for the friendly people of Bangladesh. As her special twin-jet Rajhangshah rolls into the tarmac, loud applause welcomes the great friend of Bangladesh. Waiting to receive her were Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Begum Fazilatunnesa and their youngest son Russel, among others. Addressing the biggest ever public meeting in Dhaka at the Suhrawardy Uddyan a few hours after her arrival, Indira Gandhi says that people of Bangladesh and India will be one in sharing the burden of humanity's sufferings. They will together also continue the march in shaping their destinies and that both will live as good and friendly neighbours. \"Our friendship and unity are based on an unshakable foundation,\" she adds. Bangabandhu in his speech at the programme declares that Bangladesh, realised at a very high cost in terms of life and blood, believes in peaceful co-existence and malice to none. The entire Suhrawardy Uddyan shook to its depths with the full-throated affirmation from the mammoth gathering when Bangabandhu asks whether they support the Bangladesh-India friendship and are ready to take up arms to protect their freedom, which had been achieved through great sacrifice. Representatives from the Bangladesh and Indian governments hold substantive talks at four levels during which various subjects, including trade relations, flood control, travel facilities, war crimes trial and the international situation in the subcontinent are discussed.

      "text": "At least 29 Rohingyas, who had been in one of the two boats floating on the Indian Ocean, were sheltered at the Bhashan Char after they reached the shore of Teknaf early Saturday. \"The 29 Rohingyas were taken to Bhashan Char under the supervision of the Navy,\" Mahbub Alam Talukder, Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner (RRRC), told The Daily Star yesterday. Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen said the Rohingyas took small boats and swam to the coast of Teknaf. Some of them even fled when locals were rescuing them, he said. A Rohingya broker said an international NGO gave them between Tk 90,000 and Tk 1 lakh for transporting the Rohingyas to Malaysia. As Malaysia denied to receive those Rohingyas the NGO again asked the brokers to get them back to Bangladesh, Momen said. \"The broker did not name the NGO.\" They were then taken to Bhashan Char, an island in Noakhali. Bangladesh Navy has built a housing facility of 120 cluster villages on the 40sqkm island under a Tk 2,312 crore project for accommodating one lakh of the nearly 1 million Rohingyas sheltered at cramped camps in Cox's Bazar. However, the authorities were considering shelving the relocation plan after the UN and other aid agencies opposed the plan, saying there were risks of flood and cyclones and also that it did not have facilities for accommodating the aid agency officials. The foreign minister yesterday said the government did not want to \"pollute\" the Rohingya camps during coronavirus pandemic by sheltering new members there. Therefore, the rescued Rohigyas were taken to Bhashan Char. \"Any new Rohingyas, if there are, will be sheltered at the Bhashan Char,\" he told The Daily Star. Earlier on April 16, some 400 Rohingyas were rescued by Bangladesh authorities. They were, however, quarantined in the Rohingya camp healthcare facilities. Rights bodies then said there were two boats carrying about 500 Rohingyas drifting in the sea as Malaysia and Thailand refused their entry to their territories. The UN and many other global and regional rights bodies then called for Bangladesh to rescue and shelter the Rohingyas. Momen had then requested the UN and rights bodies to ask the other regional countries to rescue and shelter the Rohingyas. Momen also wrote a letter to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet citing the international law that surrounding countries of the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea have a role to share the responsibility of helping the distressed people in the deep sea. He said so far there is information that the two boats were in the Myanmar territory of the Bay of Bengal, and that the UN should tell Myanmar to rescue and shelter the Rohingyas. On Saturday, European Union in a statement asked the regional countries to rescue and shelter the drifting Rohingyas on the Indian Ocean, following the example of Bangladesh that has been sheltering more than a million Rohingyas.

      "text": "It is believed that around 1.3 crore people have become jobless in the country so far due to the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic and the resulting lockdown. Over a two-week period, the poverty rate in Bangladesh also shot up to about 30-35 per cent range from an estimated 20 per cent plus level in 2019. Much of the remarkable gains achieved on the poverty reduction front over the more than one decade have been reversed, at least temporarily, in just a few weeks. Thus, ensuring food security for the newly poor households, along with the previously poor and vulnerable ones, is a major challenge for the government. On the overall supply side, although Bangladesh was almost self-sufficient in terms of main staple rice in 2019, we are still skating on thin ice because any major or even moderate shocks like a flood at national and regional levels or cyclone can make the supply situation precarious, as we have seen very recently in 2018 and earlier in 2008. The coronavirus-induced mass unemployment and the resulting income loss is also likely to create a major mismatch between effective demand (backed by purchasing power) and the overall supply of food, including rice, vegetables, fruits, fish, eggs and poultry, milk and livestock.  Managing the mismatch will be critical for ensuring food security for all. In the past, in our battle for food security, we generally dealt with supply shocks of various origins, and none of those events was associated with a concurrent massive nationwide demand shock as it is happening this time.  This makes the current situation unprecedented. Complicating the matter further, there is the nationwide lockdown that is disrupting not only normal life but also the flow of essential foods from farmers and producers to the ultimate consumers across Bangladesh. Under these circumstances, food security can only be ensured if: (i) we have enough domestic production of essential foods to meet domestic demand; (ii) we ensure that normal marketing chains continue to operate effectively and uninterrupted to bring foods near the neighbourhoods of consumers; and (iii) all citizens have the minimum income to meet their minimum food requirements, which in itself is a major undertaking. A review of the current supply situation for rice indicate a generally satisfactory condition except for two concerns: (i) because of lower rice price last year, the farmers have reduced the cropping area for boro cultivation by about 10 per cent, which is likely to contribute to a corresponding shortfall in realising the boro output target, the most important source of rice in Bangladesh; and (ii) boro cultivation in haor areas has already started from mid-April, and if this crop is not quickly harvested it may be significantly lost to early flooding in those areas, which is a normal phenomenon. The haor areas produce about 20 per cent of the marketable surplus of rice and the farmers generally depend on migrant labors from Northern and Southern parts of Bangladesh to complete the harvesting. The government is reportedly preparing to send a few hundred harvesters to the haor areas, which is a commendable move. But it should be executed very quickly to salvage the crop. Also, there may still be a need for about 500,000 guest labours to complete the harvesting in haor areas. The government has to make sure that the workers are there when needed. This is an opportune moment for the workers and a desperate moment for the farmers. However, the problem is lockdown -- which does not allow the conventional mechanism for the flow of workers to function. The intervention of the government is urgently needed. If the reported shortfall in boro acreage target is true, which should be verified independently and not through the Department of Agricultural Extension that has the reputation of overstating the acreage and output, the government should make advance arrangements for imports to cover the projected shortfall.  Outside the main crop of rice, if we look at the agriculture sector with a broader perspective, we are afraid of a massive shortfall in supplies despite abundant production at the farm level. This is happening with vegetables, fruits, eggs and milk. A few days back, I was watching an award-winning farmer from Gaibandaha crying on television because he could not sell his tomatoes for even Tk 3 per kg -- whereas tomatoes are being sold at Tk 90 a kg in Dhaka. We are hearing stories of watermelons and bungees rotting in the fields because those cannot be transported to major cities and urban centres. Egg price has shot up to more than Tk 150 per dozen, whereas the poultry farmers are getting only a fraction of that.  Hundreds of thousands of litres of milk are being wasted every day due to lack of transport and local processing, whereas people are suffering from malnutrition. Hundreds of thousands of containers are piled up at the Chittagong port, waiting to be shipped to domestic markets, while Ramadan is less than two weeks away. Most bank branches across Bangladesh, including in district towns, are closed and those that are open are only open for 2-3 hours. Most business transactions including the payment of salaries are being held up due to the closure of banks. Businesses cannot go on without payment of taxes, salaries, payments for transportations, and deposits and withdrawals of cash in banks. Most mobile financial service (MFS) agents cannot function without cash liquidity at hand. Ensuring the supply of essential products stuck at Chittagong port, which are already paid for, cannot wait -- these essential imports must reach the markets across Bangladesh before Ramadan. Special initiatives must be taken to ship containers from our international ports to domestic destinations and to keep banks and MFS outlets open for the financing of essential business transactions.  We cannot afford to continue with this kind of induced market failure and liquidity shortage for long. The season of mangoes, lychees and jackfruits are coming next month. The livelihoods of millions of growers would depend on selling these fruits across Bangladesh and the fruits will also provide vital nutrients to all of us in the coming months. We cannot afford to let these delicious and nutritious fruits rot. Emergency measures have to be taken to allow the market mechanisms to function while complying with the basic norms of social distancing and associated hygiene. We just cannot shut down all our village markets and prevent the middlemen from collecting the essential agricultural products from farmers. Continuing to shut down local agricultural markets and transportation will ruin our farmers as well as consumers. We have to remember, farmers do not want credit, they simply want the right price for their products. Only through effectively functioning market networks the farmers will be able to get necessary price support and that is the best incentive for ensuring future food supply. The distribution network has to reach up to the consumers while maintaining appropriate coronavirus-related norms and practices. If we look at Dhaka, the heavy-handed approach by the law-enforcement agencies to close down all retail outlets of essentials by 6 pm is self-defeating. Why cannot super shops like Shwapno and Agora or corner groceries remain open for 24 hours? That will allow people to maintain the norms of social distancing better by shopping at their convenient times. If anyone visits supermarkets in Gulshan area, he/she will find at least 40-50 people standing in line in front of the store and a crowded back to back people at the cash counters. Why should it be like that? What sort of social distancing is this? All this crowding is happening because few groceries are open and the very short store opening hours.  Around the world, grocery stores and pharmacies continue to remain open for long hours so that people can go out any time and get their essentials while complying with the norms of social distancing. What we are doing is further diminishing the level of demand that is already diminished. All medical facilities, pharmacies and essential grocery stores must be allowed to remain open as long as it is commercially viable. To ensure food security for all, we have look at the demand side along with the supply side considerations noted above. With tens of millions of people unemployed in the last several weeks, most of them will not have the purchasing power to buy the food in the required amounts. Just ensuring supplies at the right prices would not be enough to bring foods to the plates of hungry jobless households. Massive income or food support programmes will be immediately needed to bring food to their mouth. Otherwise, the resulting collapse in demand will keep crores of people hungry and starved, while agricultural product prices will collapse at the farm level and farmers will suffer badly. There will be widespread hunger and malnutrition, which is not a desirable outcome under any circumstances.  It is the responsibility of the state to ensure food security for all Bangladeshi citizens by ensuring that the minimum required amount of food reaches the plates of all citizens. Bangladesh today can afford it. But, for that to materialise the government has to provide income support for the millions unemployed and remain extremely vigilant on both supply and demand sides. We have to ensure that no food -- be it rice, fruits, vegetables, milk or eggs -- is wasted while millions remain hungry. We must keep the marketing chains open as part of essential services and work towards removing the barriers to efficient marketing through better coordination among policymakers and law enforcement agencies. We have to let the marketing chains work uninterrupted supported by inflows of liquidity from financial institutions. All necessary coordination issues related to income support, availability of monetary liquidity and opening up of the marketing chains must be resolved urgently to ensure food security.

The other reasons include malfunction of railway engines, passengers jumping recklessly from the train, breaking of rail lines, disruption of telephone systems, derailment and destructive activities on the train, disruption of rail movement due to excessive flood and head-on collision of trains, among others. The Railways Minister said this in reply to a query from Workers Party MP Lutfun Nesa Khan.  In his response, the minister said the government has taken various initiatives so that respective officials and railway staff carry out their responsibilities more consciously. \"Besides, actions are being taken against the responsible staff for their involvement in train accident,\" the minister also said. In reply to a query from ruling Awami League MP M Abdul Latif, the Railways Minister said a deal was signed with a consultation firm in 2018 for completion of the feasibility study and detailed design of the construction of Dhaka-Chattogram high-speed rail track. \"Progress of the project is 62 per cent as of December 2019,\" added the minister. In reply to a query from Jatiya Party MP Mujibul Haque, the Railways Minister said a total of 230 projects were included in the 30 year-long updated master plan (2016-2045) for Railways for implementation at a cost of Tk 5,53,662 crore."

      "text": "April 28, 1972 BANGABANDHU'S EID-E-MILADUNNABI SPEECH  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declares that his government will no more permit religion to be used for any political purposes, to accumulate wealth by a small group at the cost of the poor and the exploitation of the common people of Bangladesh. Addressing a Seratunnabi gathering at Baitul Mukarram, Bangabandhu says that the four basic principles -- nationalism, democracy, socialism and secularism -- are compatible with the teachings of the Prophet and a happy and prosperous nation could be built on these four principles. Addressing the large congregation, the prime minister says that the Prophet loved all human beings irrespective of their religion and taught people to resist all oppression carried out in the name of religion. He says that the struggle for the realisation of justice, truth and honour are compatible with the teachings of Islam. Bangabandhu urges the Muslims of Bangladesh to practise Islam and abide by the teachings of the great Prophet to prove themselves better Muslims than others. He says as Bangladesh is the second largest Muslim nation in the world, the Muslims of this new state will surely display their love for Islam by following the teachings of Islam. In Bangladesh there will be no attack on any religion and the citizens of Bangladesh will be completely free to practise and profess their respective religions. WE CAN'T IGNORE BANGLADESH, SAYS INDIRA Bangladesh has an important role to play in the sub-continent and we can certainly not ignore Bangladesh, says Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi while talking on major Indian and world problems to the press today. Asked about prisoners of war in India-Pak talks, Indira Gandhi says, \"We are not the only party.\" ACCORD ON FLOOD CONTROL MEASURES The India-Bangladesh talks for mutual cooperation on sharing of water and power resources reach complete accord over cyclone and flood control measures. The representatives of the two countries discuss in detail the terms of reference and the composition of the Joint River Commission. VOTERS' AGE LIMIT MAY BE LOWERED Bangladesh government is considering a proposal for reducing the age limit of voters from 21 to 18, enabling young people to have the opportunity of greater participation in the affairs of the state. Recalling the Awami League pledge embodied in the party's election manifesto to reduce voters' age limit, the Local Government and Rural Development Minister Shamsul Huq says that this decision will amount to the fulfillment of a promise the party had made to the people.

Our Dhaka, the city with which all of us have a love-hate relationship... all our scopes and opportunities -- livelihoods of all middle income and upper-middle income groups, comparatively better education and treatment hubs are in Dhaka. So apparently, we have few options of leaving this city. Nowadays, living in Dhaka is not a choice any more, rather it's destiny. However, the ambiance of Dhaka city is our choice, more precisely, our leaders' choice. Many of my friends would disagree with me. These friends are dedicatedly trying for the last few years to make people understand that we, the inhabitants are responsible for a better city. They argue that inhabitants are responsible for turning the poetic rainy season terrible, as they use plastic, throw garbage here and there which destroys the drainage system. They also argue that people don't obey the traffic rules hence we lose our working hours on the roads. They have many such arguments that render the responsibilities of a livable city becoming unlivable on the shoulders of the inhabitants, who are already overburdened with an excessive rate of house rent, the high price of basic food grains, fear of toxic food items, insufficient supply of freshwater and cooking gas, the challenge of reaching office on time, and above all insecurity. These poor people expect a change, wait for a better life, hence they pay taxes. Since the beginning of civilisation, people are used to nominating a leader for ensuring their collective well-being. I agree with my dear friends that people also have responsibilities. But for that, an effective governance mechanism should prevail to compel people to obey the rules and laws. Laws are formed for the people and people are bound to follow in spite of their urge to violate them. This is ensured through a fair and effective governance system. If the governance mechanism is unfair, corrupt, then it will fail to implement the rules. That's why Dhaka dwellers construct a building without following the construction codes. These people know that an under-table deal is sufficient to acquire approvals despite the issue being illegitimate. People violate traffic rules because everyone violates, and nobody cares. Here also a small transaction on the roadside is enough to get the green signal. Nowadays, Dhaka dwellers are also being consoled that the city is going to become fast and fabulous. Singapore, Los Angeles are our benchmarks! Metro rail project is underway. As if a track of metro rail is enough to ease all the pains of the city dwellers. All these assurances underscore that there is lack of confidence that the big gap between the people's expectations of a liveable city and ongoing development projects will be resolved. Unplanned development itself is a monstrosity and enough to destroy a city. In the last few years, many disasters happened in Bangladesh due to unplanned urbanisation. We can still remember the tragic incidents of fire in Nimtoli, Chawkbazar and Banani. All the major cities including Dhaka and Chittagong are regularly inundated during monsoon. Recently, Dhaka has been identified as one of the cities with the poorest air quality. The barrier to breath is also a disaster for human life. And why is this happening? Definitely because of unplanned \"so-called\" development. Not only in the megacities, but also across the country, unplanned development is a cause for various natural disasters like flood, river erosion and water-logging. Despite the mighty Sundarbans evidently protecting the coastal belt from devastating cyclones several times, this natural wonder is now at risk from a sword of Damocles which spells \"development\". Please, stop singing the song of monstrous development. Just try to give us a city to live in. Let us spend our currently depressing evenings in an open field, walk barefoot on the grass, fly our kites of hope in the blue sky, go home on foot on clean pavements, and please ensure our security and safety.  We are no longer in a position to urge for an acceptable and fair process for electing the guardians of our city and the reasons are manifold. We don't even want to discuss those anymore. But our dreams are still alive. Dipping in the abundance of suspicion and doubt, we can only wish for a city to live in, a city where we can breathe. Please listen to our unheard demands at least once, as this may be the last shot of realising these.   Shegufta Sharmin is a development worker and can be reached at shegufta@yahoo.com"

The innumerable research that are being carried out on the impact of COVID-19 throughout the world have flooded our minds, and sometimes made us confused as to what life after COVID-19 would look like.   The implications of COVID-19 on the global economy and on individual countries are becoming obvious as time goes on. The shutdown of almost all economic activities have brought miseries to economies of all strata and phases. Production and supply chains have been disrupted, exports and imports decelerated, transportation system collapsed and service sector interrupted. These have changed the lives and livelihoods of people across the world. Unemployment has soared, poverty has surged, food insecurity has increased, and above all, loss of lives is increasing by the hour. Barring a few, most governments have undertaken policy measures to address such a rapid and massive impact of corona pandemic at large scales. Health expenditures have been topped up to mitigate the health risks. Stimulus packages for various sectors of the economy have been announced with the objective being increase spending following the Keynesian theory to rejuvenate the economy. Relief packages are also in place in many countries to extend income and food support to the poor to save them from hunger. These are of course immediate responses to rescue the lives of people and also pump oxygen into the economy. And, hopefully it will work sooner rather than later. Scientists and doctors have shown some rays of hope to tackle the disease. And once health is under control, human beings are smart enough to work through in reviving the economic activities and recover the lost gains to the best of their ability. At least, history has pointed out clearly how economies could get back to life after several crises in the past. The World Wars, the Great Depression, the Spanish Flu and many more examples will confirm this. However, apart from economic recovery, will there be any changes in social, cultural and institutional norms, political systems and governance patterns? Change is a continuous process. It happens for good or for bad. Changes emanated from crises may sometimes become beneficial for humanity. What changes will COVID-19 lead to? It depends on what changes we want to see. And how we work towards that. It is not automatic.  At the onset of COVID-19, people talked about the universal nature of this pandemic. We were reminded of how every person--rich and poor, man and woman, powerful and weak--is vulnerable to this pandemic. COVID-19 does not distinguish among race, colour, gender, location, profession, position or riches. But it has been proven wrong when immediate research in many communities in several countries showed that COVID-19 also has a bias against certain groups of people. That is why African-American were more affected in the USA or the underprivileged with weak immune system in poor countries are becoming victims of COVID-19 more than others. This bias is of course not created by COVID-19. Rather it is the outcome of the biases that have been created by government policies which favour the rich and ignores the impoverished. A review of the ongoing discussions with respect to the situation during the post COVD-19 period indicates that there can be three possible scenarios. First is the business as usual situation. That is, the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and goes back to where we were before COVID-19--economically, socially, politically and environmentally. We continue to live in whatever good or bad circumstances we had during the pre-COVID-19 period. And we continue to accept and adjust to the existing realities that the world will continue to generate wealth, and economic prosperity of some countries and some people will continue to multiply but these privileges will not be universal. The second situation will be such that the global economy slides so much that it takes a long time to recover. Poverty, mortality, morbidity, food insecurity and unemployment increases. All forms of inequality within and among countries accentuates. All global targets--Sustainable Development Goals, providing support to poor countries by developed countries equivalent to 0.7 percent of their gross national income, Paris climate agreement to limit the increase of global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius--fail to be achieved. As a result, countries become inward looking and resort to protectionism. And the effectiveness of global institutions such as the United Nations, World Trade Organisations and the like decelerates. Third is the optimistic case. The economies around the world not only recovers but, moves further ahead. Governments invest more in areas such as health, education, technology, climate and work towards ending poverty, improving inclusivity, establishing good governance and creating democratic spaces. Cooperation among nations improves and commitments toward fulfilling the global promises get implemented. This is the situation where crisis will be turned into opportunity by global and national leaders. What do we expect in Bangladesh during the aftermath of COVID-19? The outcome of the greatest crisis in Bangladesh's history--the Liberation War in 1971--was regaining our prized possession, that is, an independent country. We faced the crisis in unity and solidarity. And following the war we also got a progressive constitution that upholds the dignity and rights of every citizen of Bangladesh. Social justice and equality are also enshrined in our great constitution. After 49 years of our independence, we however, cannot claim that we could keep our promises to those who sacrificed their lives for the country. Rather, the spirit of our freedom fighters is being undermined by the way some of us conduct ourselves each day and even during crisis. Politically connected people who steal relief for the flood affected people and get away with such misdeeds are also active now during COVID-19. With shame we observe when people go hungry, these people in charge of distribution of food and support have the audacity to commit such heinous crimes. With frustration we see how public representatives are nowhere to be seen to coordinate the relief work and help their voters to survive. With sadness we note how people behave with the frontline workers of this crisis who are risking their own lives and also how health workers mistreat patients by forgetting the core values of their profession. With discouragement we learn how faulty and corrupt the health procurement is and how the poor are deprived of medicines allocated for them. And, all of a sudden, it seems everyone has become poor in Bangladesh!  The way every business--irrespective of its size and strength, is seeking stimulus packages from the government reminds us of the old story of greed, not need. One wonders, will people change in their attitude and behaviour or keep repeating their old acts once COVID-19 recedes?

In the much-anticipated elections of the Dhaka South City Corporation, Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh was unofficially declared the winner and voted mayor of DSCC today. Taposh secured 4,24,595 votes to beat his closest contender, BNP candidate Ishraque Hossain, by a margin of nearly two lakh votes. The AL mayoral candidate for the north city corporation Atiqul Islam is also expected to secure the post. WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE MAYOR IN THE SOUTH\n Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, a barrister by profession, was elected as lawmaker from Dhaka-10 constituency in the 2018 parliamentary elections. He resigned from his post to contest the mayoral polls. In his manifesto for this election, Taposh unveiled plans to turn Dhaka south into a tourist destination, including making the old central jail into an amusement park. \"If elected, I will construct museums and art galleries in collaboration with everyone and revive both Old Dhaka and the city,\" Taposh had said, appealing to cultural elites. Some roads will be dedicated for fast vehicles, some for medium-speed vehicles and some for pedestrians only, he had said. There will be roads for fire trucks and the city corporation will have its own team of firefighters, he pledged. He also promised enough women's hostels equipped with round-the-clock helplines and an app for service seekers. In a welcomed pledge, he said, \"We will not allow any service providing organisation to dig up a road until three years after it was repaired.\" He said the footpaths would be free from hawkers and illegal occupants. He also promised not to raise holding taxes and said proper management could generate revenues for the DSCC.  "

      "text": "MARCH 19, 1972 INDO-BANGLADESH TREATY AND JOINT DECLARATION  A historic 25-year treaty is signed between Bangladesh and India today. The treaty of friendship, cooperation and peace between the two countries is signed at Bangabhaban by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman for Bangladesh and Indira Gandhi for India. The treaty is similar to the one earlier signed between India and the Soviet Union.    The treaty affirms that each side shall respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the other and refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of the other side. Each high contracting party solemnly declares that it shall enter into or participate in any military alliance when the other is threatened or under attack.  In case one is attacked or threatened with attack, the two parties shall immediately enter into mutual consultation in order to take appropriate effective measures to eliminate the threat and thus ensure peace and security.  The treaty also provides for joint studies and joint action in the fields of flood control, river basin development, development of hydro-electric power and irrigation.  A joint declaration of the two prime ministers is also signed at the ceremony. The following are the highlights of the joint declaration: Bangladesh prime minister expresses admiration for the valiant armed forces of India for their supreme sacrifice. The two prime ministers decide to establish a joint rivers commission to carry out a comprehensive survey of the river systems shared by the two countries and formulate projects concerning both the countries in the fields of flood control. Both prime ministers approve the principles of the revival of the transit trade and the agreement on border trade and direct that these agreements, as well as the general trade and payment agreements, should be signed by the end of this month.    INDIA WON'T ACCEPT BIHARIS Indira Gandhi says at a press conference in Dhaka today that India will not absorb Pakistani nationals in her territory. An American correspondent asks her whether India will take back the non-Bengalis who came from India and settled in Bangladesh. In reply, Indira Gandhi says that the non-Bengalis living in Bangladesh went to Pakistan some 20 years ago and they are Pakistani nationals. It is up to the Biharis to decide whether they will go to Pakistan or stay in Bangladesh as loyal citizens, she adds.

      "text": "As we bade farewell to the teens of this century, most of us--if not all of us--must have been looking back on our changes, gains and losses as a person, as a society and as a nation. While there will be many memories to fondly remember and many achievements to proudly celebrate on all three fronts, I cannot help but think that how we have felt about the ending decade will ascertain our aspirations for the next. As an economist, I'm supposed to now be quoting statistics and figures to make a point on how developed we have become as a nation, and I'm meant to draw a conclusion from the numbers on what have been our accomplishments and what have been our shortcomings. Ideally, I am supposed to talk about factors like GDP growth, per capita income, poverty rate, investment, labour force participation rate. But I don't feel like being \"ideal\", there are many qualified people to do that. Today, I am writing not only as an economist, but as an educator, a female, a youth, a citizen and as a hopeless dreamer of a Bangladesh that will be fair, just, equitable and safe. Yes, our statistics do tell a tale of glory and perhaps they are the bricks that are paving our path towards becoming a middle-income country in 2024. However, at the brink between these two eras, I could not help but ask myself some questions to which the answers that automatically came to my mind contradict the high aspirations of development that we are dreaming of. If we really have made so much progress, why can't I--as a woman of this city--feel safe and comfortable to walk in the city at night? Why can't girls safely and comfortably use public transport? I had restrictions on going out alone when I was a college student in 2009, and much hasn't changed now that I am an educator 10 years later. The only difference is that it's not my mother restricting me now, it is my own fear of what might happen and what I might face if I do. Why do our students still need to be scared in their own dormitories and have to be weary of getting beaten up on their own university campus? Why does it feel like we're breathing in toxicity--both literally and figuratively--when we're meant to be breathing in fresh air? Why is it that more and more of us are getting increasingly comfortable with remaining silent in the face of wrongdoing? Can a person with lesser mobility function independently, comfortably and safely in Dhaka? Has life changed for a rickshaw-puller who in 2009 had to struggle to feed his family and consider sending all his children to school at the same time? Whether we live in an apartment in Gulshan or in a slum in Mirpur, why can we not sleep without a mosquito net at night in fear of dengue? Why is it that we cannot put our faith in a glass of drinking water in a public place unless it is a sealed water bottle? How can we think of ourselves as living in a developing or developed nation when if in the case of emergency, there is no guarantee that we will get the proper medical care? At this point in time, why is it that we still haven't been able to bring in life-saving drugs? How come it is still unthinkable to use public restrooms, or most restrooms, for that matter in Bangladesh? Most of our people still do not know the basic etiquette or common sense in using restrooms in public places. For example, in aeroplanes. Then when it comes to flights, it's desperately sad that the migrant workers working so hard abroad to bring remittance into this country still have to ask others desperately to fill in their embarkation forms and are misbehaved with? So many more questions come to my mind, and in fact, these questions are important ones to ponder if we want to prioritise inclusive development and not just development and also if we want our development to be simultaneous with improvement in standard of living and quality of life. Our women are having to migrate abroad for work and then they return in tears after being abused and tortured. Anyone anywhere with some power is using the power to trap someone--who crossed them--in lawsuits with false claims. Families are being torn apart in continuous road accidents. Corruption is rising at all levels and ethics are at a demise. A talented but simple boy from a village doesn't turn up in the scholarship viva because he has no \"connections\" and knows he will never get the respect his qualifications deserve. Farmers cry in their prayers for better crops while the rest of us race on with our lives of restaurant food and luxuries. Our students are kept up all night to participate in political activities, yet we expect them to pass in their exams at 8 the next morning. Domestic help are beaten up while we bask in the drama of our Hindi serials. And our children--privileged and underprivileged--lose a bit of their childhood every day as we fail to set our priorities right and chase after the illusions of development. No matter how much someone harps on about the beautiful economic indicators and rising figures of progress, we cannot and should not ignore the fact that this country has become unliveable and even more so if you are poor, if you are marginalised, if you are different. Rich people at least have money, hence choices, but poor people have their hands tied and are forsaken to accept whatever fate comes their way--be it medical catastrophe, natural disaster, abuse or rape. Amidst all these questions without satisfactory answers, how can we still be daydreaming of graduation \"with distinction\" if we haven't even reached a pass mark yet on so many fronts? If we truly love this country and its people, we cannot just keep praising ourselves and patting ourselves on the back for our triumphs. We have far to go, but only if we prioritise the questions asked above. We have got to set our standards properly. Do we want development without well-being, progress without quality? If other countries, like Bhutan, can set their standards and achieve them, why can't we? Isn't it time we get our priorities straight? Are we so divided in what we want? Has it become our social norm to be indifferent, to be silent? In his new book \"How change happens\", Cass R Sunstein talks about social norms and how they can shape a society and affect social change. In answer to the question, \"How does social change happen?\", Sunstein postulates that \"One day, someone challenges the norm. After that small challenge, others may begin to say what they think. Once that happens, a drip can become a flood.\" In this regard, the consequent question for us becomes, do we care enough for the future of our society and nation to challenge the norms that are pulling us behind as we strive to move forward? How will our social change happen--the social change that will help us set our standards? On one hand, we need to be able to call a spade a spade. That doesn't seem possible until someone or something breaks our existing social norm of indifference and silence. So, in the meantime? Research, it all comes down to research. We need answers to our questions and we need valid and reliable ways of finding the answers. We need to understand and realise what steps we should take. We also need to develop an attitude to accept what the results of our research end up to be. That means that our well-being should always be the main priority, not business and commercialisation. But is that the case? Sorry to burst our bubble, but are we ready for the status we are yearning to attain? Do we want to continue as it is with improving statistics of growth and prosperity, or do we want the stories to matter too? For now, I for one am tired of feeling helpless and I want to do my part in bringing about social change. Let me appeal to the policymakers and the powerful on behalf of the cohorts I represent: teachers and researchers--forsaken academicians. You know, the future of this country may just lie in our classrooms and in our research. We have the expertise and the zeal, but we need the incentives--the funds--to survive and to be able to pursue original thinking. So, if you're looking for somewhere to spend, pour the funds into our institutions.  Give us the backing we need, and we will lead this nation out of danger. At least give us the chance to try.
