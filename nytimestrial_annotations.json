Illustrated. 511 pp. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. $49.95.\nAMONG images Bangladesh brings to mind are a green and fertile delta, a new state liberated from Pakistan in 1971 and the interesting paradox of a mainly Muslim country whose Government and opposition party are both led by women. The dominant images are less favorable: a site of bloodshed and military rule, a poor and densely populated land, a proneness to vast floods and deadly cyclones, a place dismissed by Henry Kissinger as a ''basket case.''\n In ''Art and Life in Bangladesh,'' Henry Glassie, the folklorist from Indiana University, wants to distract us from these stereotypes and focus attention on the Bangladeshis themselves. As he has already done in the cases of Ireland and Turkey with conspicuous success, he introduces Bangladesh through art. This is, he declares, ''the most human of things . . . a potential in every individual . . . nurtured in social experience . . . a reality in any culture.''\n Art makes available complex human experience. If that is studied with respect for others, if we strive truly to value what they value, we can bridge the differences that separate us. Art, in Glassie's felicitous phrase, is a ''courteous entry'' to the lives of artists and their culture. He hopes that by sharing in his exploration of the world of art in Bangladesh we may broaden our understanding of our common humanity. We may also begin to review our Western perceptions and come to see Bangladesh less as a place of poverty and disaster and more as one rich in artistic prowess and human excellence.\n At the heart of this work lie a host of encounters with artists that Glassie recorded between 1987 and 1996. Pottery is a great art form of the clay-rich delta; it thrives in more than 680 villages containing on average 50 potters. The art and lives of many are discussed. Three master potters stand out, beginning with Amulya Chandra Pal, who, from a background of making sculptures of traditional religious figures, has become a great innovator in clay, fashioning animals and children's toys, terra-cotta plaques of rural life and religious images, and figures of national cultural importance, like Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam. Maran Chand Paul, known as the King of Clay, is a modernizer who concentrates on decorative work, follows English and Japanese styles of glaze, uses up-to-date techniques like a gas-fired kiln and exports to over 50 countries. And Haripada Pal, described by Glassie's wife, the art historian Kathleen A. Foster, as one of the ''finest sculptors at work in the modern world,'' focuses on religious figures -- Saraswati, Vishnu, Radha and Krishna -- and invests his work with a powerful spiritual aura.\n Other artists also figure: engravers of brass, builders of ships and weavers of cane mats and jamdani cloth. A good number are women. Tapati Rani Dey's workshop produces 6,000 painted panels a year for the rickshaws of Dhaka; Rashida Musharraf's workshop casts Hindu and Buddhist images in brass. The artists are persuaded to speak, often at length. Their work is spread before us in more than 450 photographs; those in color are quite ravishing. When they speak of art, these artists make no distinction, as is often done in the West, between craft and art, between objects of utility and those made for pleasure. Every medium has the possibility of art, and what signifies art is the achievement of excellence in that medium. Thus, art for Amulya Chandra Pal is inextricably bound up with ordinary life. ''The process of skilled creation is not divided from the quotidian flow,'' Glassie writes. ''It belongs to the daily round of work, and even its most glorious products are meshed in commerce and destined for participatory roles in human affairs.''\n For Haripada Pal, the sculptor of religious figures, art and worship mingle in a common stream. Prayer brings the love that is essential to creation. Through love he is able to fashion God, the infinite, in material forms of beauty. Is it surprising that Maran Chand Paul feels sad that his large export orders have turned him into a manager? ''I love to create,'' he says. But success robs him of the essential pleasure of his art.\n Religious tolerance is a striking feature of this world. Tapati Rani Dey, a sophisticated Hindu, paints the most pervasive symbol of Islam, the Taj Mahal, for the Muslim rickshaw trade. Rashida Musharraf, a Muslim, has no difficulty in casting idolatrous bronzes. A Sufi sings of the longing of Radha for Krishna, and his Muslim audience is enraptured by this metaphor of the soul's longing for God. For many, God, Bhagaban and Allah are one. ''All of us, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists,'' Haripada Pal declares, ''are here in this vexed place, struggling to endure for a brief span. The world is one, and we are one, all of us alike in the drop of God we contain.''\n Unfortunately, this spiritual wisdom is gravely threatened. The 16 percent of the population that is Hindu feels increasingly marginalized as politicians have adopted Islamization policies since the assassination of Sheik Mujib in 1975. Matters worsened after Hindu revivalists destroyed India's Babri Masjid in 1992; Hindus found their temples sacked. The future depresses Amulya Chandra Pal. The number of Hindu potters declines. They migrate to India. \n As Glassie tells it, Islamic assertiveness is a relatively recent arrival in Bangladesh. It does, however, go back to the Muslim revival of the 19th century, and has been supported in various ways over the past 50 years by movements like the Tablighi Jamaat and the Jamaati Islami. It would have been possible to take different routes through the peoples of Bangladesh and produce a less tolerant religious vision.\n Other changes also threaten the artists. Aluminum pots eat into the demand for those in clay, copper and brass. Potters, as they seek to exploit a new middle-class market, find they must sacrifice their old art of religious significance for brightly colored, decorative, worldly items that speak only of the power to spend. One development, however, that does not threaten -- poverty has its mercies -- is cultural imperialism from America. References to America are scarce in Dhaka's gallery of rickshaw art; more are to Europe and Asia, and most to Bangladesh.\n This marvelous book is an outstanding introduction to a little-known land. A fine celebration of its people on the 50th anniversary of its freedom from British rule, it is worthy of the attention of all who value what it is to be creative and to be human.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"01a25368-6a36-4472-85c4-ea05be61d274","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:02:34.566+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"02f6a8e8-caa8-4028-9217-10d248b3f6d8","content":"PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW; Trolling and Scavenging To Fill Empty Bellies\n2001-02-09T05:00:00.000Z\nIn 1998, concerned about crucial problems in Asia of food production, population explosion and environmental destruction, the Japanese photojournalist Hiroji Kubota went to various Asian countries to bring their troubles to the eyes of the Western world.\nThe results of his odyssey, to China, the Indian subcontinent, Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia, make up ''Can We Feed Ourselves? A Focus on Asia: Photographs by Hiroji Kubota,'' at the Asia Society's temporary Midtown quarters.\nAt a news conference on the show's opening day, Mr. Kubota, explaining the absence of scrawny corpses or ''big-bellied babies'' in his pictures, said he was not interested in ''sensations'' but in focusing on how people earned their bread (or rice) in the face of many obstacles.\nIn a preface to the show's catalog, Gordon Conway, president of the Rockefeller Foundation and author of the recent book ''The Doubly Green Revolution: Food for All in the 21st Century,'' published by Magnum Photos, writes, ''Today, about 800 million people, some 15 percent of the world's population, get less than 2,000 calories a day and live a life of permanent or intermittent hunger and are chronically undernourished. Over 500 million of these people live in Asia.''\nBut Mr. Kubota's 67 color photographs, many of them very beautiful, do not include many shocking scenes. They make up a rambling, informal survey that is part travelogue, part National Geographic pictorial essay, part observation of land and the way it is worked and part picturesque chronicle of the poor and hungry.\nMr. Kubota, a prizewinning member of the distinguished photographers' cooperative Magnum, also reports on other phenomena, like the cremation of bodies in Bali, compulsory Buddhist training for boys in Myanmar and a mass rally of schoolchildren in North Korea to celebrate the 80th birthday of President Kim Il Sung in 1992.\nStill, even if the show has some extraneous material, it is noteworthy for its wide-angle view of Asia's struggles, from a mother and her baby roosting on the streets of Calcutta to farmers repairing a canal damaged by flooding in Hunan, China.\nThere are photographs of children selling vegetables in Katmandu, Nepal; a boy in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, scavenging for fish fallen off a boat in the Mekong River; and men squatting on the streets before a restaurant in Delhi, waiting for charitable visitors to a nearby mosque to give money to provide them with food.\nUrban scenes loom large. In Bhaktapur, the ancient capital of Nepal, men hack up buffalo meat on the street as a wistful dog watches. In the Indian town of Fatehpur, Rajastan, a man leads a camel past a bus packed with passengers even on its rooftop. A squalid vignette in Calcutta -- as squalid as it gets in this exhibition -- depicts ragpickers going through a trash dump on a corner lot. ''On the other hand,'' the caption says earnestly, some people in the same city ''live in great luxury.''\nHuge crowds are an Asian commonplace. Those who complain about traffic in New York should try the high-density city of Dhaka, Bangladesh, where a striking photograph shows a street in the old section jammed wall-to-wall with the rickshaws that make up most of the city's rolling stock.\nIn sharp contrast are scenes of the countryside, where farmers till precious land that, Mr. Conway writes, is gradually losing its productivity to environmental degradation and other disasters (a recent example: the devastating earthquake in Gujarat, India). Once-fertile farm land and buildings still buried to their roofs in an ash-and-mud mix are shown in a desolate view of the aftermath of a huge volcanic eruption of 1991 in Luzon, the Philippines.\nA tropical rain forest in Kalimantan on the island of Borneo, a rugged green carpet (seen from a plane) once second in size to its counterpart in the Amazon Basin, is expected to disappear in a decade unless environmental restrictions are imposed. In Shaanxi Province, China, a farmer plies a pick ax on dry-as-dust terraced ground near the Yellow River, prevented by the lack of an irrigation system from using its water.\nBut there are more optimistic views in which mastery of the land and extraction of its riches still pose a hopeful challenge. Among them are an image of a farmer plowing his green-terraced rice field behind a team of water buffalo against the magnificent backdrop of Mount Agung, Bali's tallest and holiest mountain. Another shows a flock of contented-looking sheep being milked in Nei Mongol, China, the highest quality grazing grass in the country stretching away in a green prairie behind them.\nIn the city of Baotou in the same province a sizable crowd of workers on bicycles reports for early morning duty at the Baotou Steel Mills, whose 60,000 employees produce 1.5 million tons of steel a year. You can't eat it, but steel, an essential product for China's modernization, has a great deal to do with keeping rice on the table.\nDespite its affecting photographs, this show is really not geared to throw much light on whether Asia can feed itself in the future. But as one man's enlightened view of a world that most of us know dangerously little about, it's an eye-opener.\n''Can We Feed Ourselves?

The devastation was all the more severe because flimsy dams and embankments collapsed under the weight of floodwaters. The mud houses of the poor were the first to wash away. \nWeather scientists have said South Asia is likely to get much more unpredictable rain in the coming decades, bringing greater challenges for its governments to prepare and cope with nature’s fury. \nIn Bangladesh, perennially inundated because so much of it is low-lying delta, more than half of the districts were under water. More than one million families were affected by flooding, according to government officials; the death toll after a week’s heavy rains stood at 58. \nAccording to the country’s meteorological department, Bangladesh received just under 29 inches of rain in July, about double the average. Bangladesh also felt the brunt of greater rain upstream in northern and northeastern India, as swollen rivers broke through their banks on their way down to the Bay of Bengal, said Saiful Hossain, executive engineer of the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center, a government agency. \nThe flooding has presented the country’s army-backed caretaker government, which took power in January, with its latest and perhaps toughest challenge. Its impact has been felt far beyond the flood-affected districts. Prices of essential commodities, including food, have spiked in recent weeks because flooded roads have disrupted transportation. The government sought this week to dispel public anxiety over food shortages, saying that it was ready to bring food from abroad. As in all floods every year, nature shared blame with human negligence. A 600-mile flood protection dam was badly damaged this year. \nIn Nepal, unremitting rains for the last two weeks flooded swaths of the heavily populated southern plains, known as the Terai Region, on the border with India. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that up to 300,000 people were in need of water, food and other basic supplies.\n Nearly 10,000 people were displaced, and 84 had been killed, said Paul Handley, a field coordinator with the agency. He added that the full scale of damage could be ascertained only in the coming days to determine how much agricultural land had been ruined and how many buildings destroyed. \nNepal, too, is accustomed to floods each year. But the unusually heavy rains this year seem to have affected more of the country, and with rainwater pooling up and refusing to recede, fragile mud buildings are threatened, and the likelihood of an outbreak of water-borne diseases like diarrhea also increases. \nThe United Nations and aid agencies in Nepal have already nearly exhausted their supplies of food and other goods, Mr. Handley said, although the monsoon season is not expected to end for at least another month. \nIn India, the monsoon’s trail of destruction traveled to the north and northeast last week. The death toll since the start of the monsoon in June stood at 1,225, according to the Home Ministry. \n The military was deployed to the worst affected states, including Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where more than 12 million people have been affected by flooding over the last week. The Indian Air Force air-dropped food packets to displaced people in Bihar on Saturday, where 70,000 houses were damaged, according to the Press Trust of India, \nPakistan has already had its turn with flooding. In July rains in Baluchistan and Sindh provinces, the death toll reached 329 and 90,000 families were made homeless, the United Nations said.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[{"tagged_token_id":"bcbf3186-ca3f-4088-8cde-a50d9987f471","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"0419c657-ad48-4416-afa7-c106dc85f3fc","start":98,"end":185,"tag":"Flood type","tag_id":"6de6f201-e6f3-46be-845f-21a8d8190680","value":" Nothing tests the mettle of government in this part of the world than a fierce monsoon","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:05:43.653+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"2fc18f60-5c40-43b7-8408-a4c276064554","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"0419c657-ad48-4416-afa7-c106dc85f3fc","start":237,"end":246,"tag":"Start date context","tag_id":"d59b20b0-f04b-4098-8f91-1b1050cdb9bd","value":"this week","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:06:07.028+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"0419c657-ad48-4416-afa7-c106dc85f3fc","classname":"Monsoon ","class_id":"a4fc0707-94d3-4ddb-8b3a-6dd4da2f2e84","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:03:02.583+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"04a73a93-348c-4104-b82e-93651a395504","content":"Warming threatens farms in India, UN official says\n2007-08-07T05:00:00.000Z\nNEW DELHI — As exceptionally heavy rains continued to cut a wide swath of ruin across northern India, a top United Nations official warned Tuesday that the vagaries of climate change could destroy vast areas of farmland in this country, ultimately affecting food production and adding to the woes of already desperate peasants who live off of the land.\nEven a small increase in temperatures, said Jacques Diouf, director general of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, could push down crop yields in southern regions of the world, even as agricultural productivity goes up in northern climes like Europe. A greater frequency of droughts and floods, the agency added, could be particularly bad for agriculture.\n\"Rain-fed agriculture in marginal areas in semi-arid and subhumid regions is mostly at risk,\" Diouf said on a visit to the southern Indian city of Chennai. \"India could lose 125 million tons of its rain-fed cereal production, equivalent to 18 percent of its total production.\"\nThat is a signal of the steep human and economic impact of extreme weather in India, where a majority of peasants still rely on the rains to irrigate their fields and where a bad flood can be nearly as devastating as a bad drought. The latest floods have affected an estimated 20 million people in India alone, 8 million in neighboring Bangladesh and 300,000 in Nepal, according to the United Nations children's agency.\nThe World Meteorological Organization said in a statement on Tuesday that the region experienced double the normal number of monsoon depressions in the first half of the four-month rainy season which started in June, causing heavy rainfall and flooding across South Asia.\nNearly a third of India's meteorological districts received higher-than-average rains, according to government figures. The latest tally released by the Home Ministry reads like an inventory of ruin: nearly 8,000 square miles of agricultural land inundated since the start of the monsoon two months ago, more than 130,000 houses destroyed, 1,428 people killed.\nGovernment relief teams have fanned out across northern Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh States, dropping relief packets by air. Even as the rains stopped over the last couple of days, stagnant water raised the risks of water-borne disease, from diarrhea to dengue fever, in areas that are already among the nation's poorest and least healthy. There have been no reports of disease outbreaks yet.\nIndia stands to bear the brunt of some of the worst effects of climate change, in large measure because it is ill-prepared. When the rivers swell, fragile embankments burst. Mud and thatch houses easily crumble. When the water rises, as it does year after year to varying degrees, Indian peasants are ritually stranded.\n\"These floods are a curse to us,\" Ganesh Acharya, 40, said by telephone from a marooned part of Bihar State. \"Our lives comes to a standstill.\" In his village, he said, the rice crop had washed away, and people have had to paddle to a nearby village to buy basic goods, at far higher prices than normal.\nShiv Shankar Acharya, 58, a local college lecturer, said he did not recall when so much water had accumulated, and had refused to subside for more than 10 days.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[{"tagged_token_id":"8d961f07-c5a9-4bd9-844b-bbe41987d103","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"04a73a93-348c-4104-b82e-93651a395504","start":51,"end":61,"tag":"end date context","tag_id":"88cf8c2b-74e5-4ceb-8d00-3c3b56f4dacb","value":"2007-08-07","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:13:03.868+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"b0f336b1-4f03-4e06-8ccc-49bdabdfeaca","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"04a73a93-348c-4104-b82e-93651a395504","start":1392,"end":1427,"tag":"people displaced","tag_id":"4d4b0aa8-16e5-4874-bd1e-24b9130c8835","value":"8 million in neighboring Bangladesh","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:10:16.636+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"9389d533-6d6b-45f8-816a-1c53d8fc6f67","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"04a73a93-348c-4104-b82e-93651a395504","start":2036,"end":2075,"tag":"Start date context","tag_id":"d59b20b0-f04b-4098-8f91-1b1050cdb9bd","value":"the start of the monsoon two months ago","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:12:49.804+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"04a73a93-348c-4104-b82e-93651a395504","classname":"Monsoon ","class_id":"a4fc0707-94d3-4ddb-8b3a-6dd4da2f2e84","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:08:23.806+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"056fe98b-46ce-43cc-b8cb-b36b4e80a525","content":"WATER; Pushing the Limits Of an Irreplaceable Resource\n1998-12-08T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE earth came into being, according to the ascendant view among scientists, when chunks of rocky matter that had coalesced from the particles of an interstellar nebula, the same one from which the sun materialized, began clumping together under the force of mutual gravity about 4.6 billion years ago. More chunks along with comets continued to bombard the planet's growing mass, according to this view, bringing with them one of the earth's most basic materials: water.\nOceans formed. A few of the rocky chunks crashing into the nascent planet might have been so big that the heat of their impact temporarily vaporized the young seas. But eventually the period of heavy bombardment ended, things more or less settled down, and within about 800 million years after its birth, the earth had assumed its identity as the Watery Planet.\nAll or most of the water the earth has today was here then, and it may be about all the planet will ever have.\nOf this supply, 97.5 percent resides in the oceans and seas as salt water. Most of the remaining 2.5 percent, the planet's entire ration of fresh water, is imprisoned in glaciers and ice caps, unavailable for use by people and other living things. In all, less than 1 percent -- the actual figure is put by some experts at .77 of 1 percent -- is in lakes, rivers, swamps, aquifers and other such receptacles, or floating as clouds or invisible vapor in the atmosphere or locked up in soils and plant tissues.\nEven that overstates water's true availability. The renewable freshwater supply on land, constantly replenished as part of a perpetual cycle in which water evaporates from the oceans and falls as saltless precipitation, has been estimated to represent a microscopic eight-thousandths of all the water on earth.\nThis small, finite supply is the water that actually supports human existence. Except for oxygen, it is the most vital substance on the planet for people.\nIn pursuit of this indispensable elixir, humans have in recent history multiplied their impact from the significant to the enormous. Population expansion and the inexorable march of industrial technology and urbanization have pushed people to use 35 times as much water as they did three centuries ago. One recent study concluded that more than half of all accessible water is now diverted for human use.\nThe amount appropriated by people continues to grow as the human population expands. In some places serious water shortages loom, even as the world as a whole wastes water extravagantly. While there is some cause for encouragement in the overall picture, there is also serious concern that some regions will have enough water for everyday needs, or to produce enough food -- but not both.\nPeople are not only dependent on water, but have been at its mercy. Ancient civilizations from the Middle East to Latin America, possibly including the fabled Maya, have expired for lack of it. Floods have been a fearsome occurrence throughout history; the deaths last month of more than 10,000 Central Americans from floods caused by Hurricane Mitch are a fresh example.\nVirtually every culture has its flood myth, and water has long been an object of awe and of verse and story, from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Ancient Mariner (''Water, water, everywhere/Nor any drop to drink'') to the cowboy songs of the Sons of the Pioneers (''Cool, clear water''). People have prayed for water and fought over it. Sometimes they have used it as a weapon; in 1938, for instance, China dynamited dikes on the Yellow River to destroy part of an invading Japanese army.\nBut it is at the mundane level of day-to-day use that the relationship between humans and water has acquired new dimensions. People trap water, tap it, rechannel it, transfer it, pollute it, consume it, feed it to livestock, ladle it onto farm fields (by far the biggest single use) and flush it through factories, power plants and toilets.\nIn this way, people have significantly altered the earth's life-giving water cycle; indeed, humans are now an important part of it. They have drastically upset the workings of freshwater ecosystems, with a consequent loss of biological variety and vitality. By closely corseting rivers and streams, they have denied water to flood plains, and in the process have often squeezed flood water into faster, deeper, more dangerous sluices.\nYet the biosphere never really runs out of water. Only a minor part of what is withdrawn from nature is consumed; most is released back into the water cycle to be used again. Even the water consumed by living creatures finds its way back into the cycle when the creatures excrete, exhale or die. Because of this capacity for renewal, some experts believe there is probably enough water to meet burgeoning humanity's basic drinking, cooking and sanitation needs for some time. That is the theory. In reality, more than a billion people do not have access to clean drinking water now. The reason, critics say, is that many developing countries, along with international aid agencies, have not provided community-level drinking water and sanitation systems. Plenty of water may be stored behind big dams, but it does as much harm as good there, and sometimes maybe more, when it becomes as polluted as it has in many parts of the world.\nEven if the pollution disappeared and everyone on the earth had enough good water for everyday living, experts say, many countries would still run out of water in the future -- if they insist on producing all their own food. The vagaries of the atmosphere declare that some regions are rain-rich and others rain-poor. The Middle East, Northern Africa and the American Southwest are prime examples of rain-poor regions. There, water means wealth and lack of it means relative poverty. So a sometimes-bitter competition has arisen between expanding urban populations -- which are exploding especially in the developing world -- and agricultural interests.\nThe amount of water used for irrigation has dropped somewhat around the world as the big cities have siphoned off more for their own use. Eventually, some experts believe, some dry areas will not be able to serve both the needs of farming and those of the ballooning cities. If these regions are to meet everyday water requirements, they might have to permanently import all or most of their food. This raises the prospect that lack of water will make some countries chronically dependent on others, or on the international community at large.\nWater has long been a source of conflict between regions, cultures and countries. In California in the 1920's, the Los Angeles Valley aqueduct and pipeline were bombed repeatedly by those who wanted to prevent diversions of water from agricultural land to Los Angeles. Diversion of river waters between India and both Pakistan and Bangladesh was a chronic source of tension for decades. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Israel destroyed Arab diversion works on the Jordan River and occupied the West Bank, under which lies a major aquifer. In 1988, when Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who would later become the United Nations Secretary General, was Egypt's foreign affairs minister, he predicted that ''the next war in our region will be over the waters of the Nile, not politics.''\nTensions caused by the clash between scarce water and ever more abundant populations are likely only to intensify. The study that concluded that people are using half the world's accessible water supply also noted that new dam construction might increase that supply by only about 10 percent over the next 30 years. Meanwhile, population is expected to grow at about four times that rate.\nIn the face of these increasing pressures, there are some encouraging signs. The conventional belief, for years, has been that water use unavoidably rises with population and economic growth. That was true in the United States when its industrial economy was expanding most rapidly. In the first eight decades of the 20th century, growth in water use by Americans outstripped population growth by about 5 to 2.\nBut recently, developed countries, possibly charting a path for poorer ones, have begun using water more efficiently. In the United States, water use has actually declined -- by about 20 percent ar person from 1980 to 1995, according to the United States Geological Survey. Experts attribute the decline to new water-saving technologies and practices ranging from less wasteful irrigation gear to water-stingy toilets.\nSometimes, as in the Western states, the switch was inspired by the prospect of water shortages and the increasing costs of irrigation. At the same time, the best sites for dams had long since been exploited, and building new ones had become increasingly costly. Dam construction was also inhibited by growing concern about their negative ecological impact. So the emphasis, at least in the United States, has shifted from scrambling to expand water supplies to using water more efficiently.\nWater in the industrial world has also become cleaner in the last three decades. Many once-polluted rivers, lakes and streams have been cleared of industrial wastes, and treatment plants have long since made water universally drinkable in the developed countries. The Hudson River, like many American streams, was once given up for dead but today abounds with life. People can even swim in it -- unthinkable 30 years ago.\nAnother ecological disruption is also being remedied. All across the country, from Maine to the Grand Canyon to California, the flow of water from dams is being readjusted and in some cases dams are being removed to accommodate aquatic ecosystems once again.\nThe millennium is not here, however. The change in humans' handling of water has only begun even in the United States, where it is probably the farthest advanced. The continuing runoff of millions of tons of nitrogen from farm fields into rivers and streams alone, could negate many of the constructive efforts by choking the water with too many nutrients. And big dams are still being built, mainly in the developing world, as witnessed most strikingly by the biggest of all, the gigantic Three Gorges project under construction on the Yangtze River in China.\nThere is a major wild card in all of this. Most climate scientists believe that emissions of gases like carbon dioxide will raise the earth's average global temperature by about 3.5 degrees over the next century. A warmer planet, many scientists say, would intensify the water cycle: Floods might become worse. But the land would dry out more and faster between rain storms, and where it seldom rains, the warmth would make droughts more severe.\nFor now, at least, the big question is whether humanity can learn to use an irreplaceable but maybe adequate resource in a way that can slake everyone's thirst without continuing to damage the natural order.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"056fe98b-46ce-43cc-b8cb-b36b4e80a525","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:21:26.325+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"07403aff-d5a4-4601-ad6e-226ab82f4568","content":"AFTER THE ATTACKS: THE FOREIGNERS; Outside U.S., Families Keep Tortured Vigil For Their Own\n2001-09-15T05:00:00.000Z\nThe hijackers who destroyed Manhattan's twin towers may have had America in their sights, but, judging by the list of victims, they ended up taking on the world.\nIn towns and cities from Argentina to Denmark, China to South Africa, relatives and loved ones of people missing in the attacks have been ceaselessly watching television and keeping the same despairing vigils by telephone as their counterparts in the United States.\nAmong those killed were professionals who had moved to the United States with their families to further their careers, young people spending time on internships, business travelers keeping appointments or attending work seminars, workers at the many foreign companies in the buildings and tourists taking in one of New York's prized sights on a day of startling autumnal clarity.\nIn an age in which high tech communications have wired distant places into a global neighborhood, many of the poignant farewell conversations that are emerging in news reports of the victims' last moments were held between people a continent away from each other.\nDerek Sword, 29, a Scot who worked on the south tower's 89th floor, called his family in Dundee to tell them he was fine. ''That must have been seconds after the plane went in,'' his mother said. ''That was really it, and we have not heard anything else since.''\nThe parents of Ron Gilligan, 43, a British broker on the 105th floor, saw the burning building on television at their home in Liverpool and placed an urgent call to him. There was no answer, and the trans-Atlantic silence has persisted.\nIn Sheffield, in the British Midlands, the mourning is for Nigel Thompson, 33, who worked for Cantor Fitzgerald on the 105th floor of the north tower and was on the phone with his twin brother Neil when the first plane crashed into his building. ''We are under attack,'' he said. ''We are evacuating now.'' He has not been heard from since.\nCommentators in Dublin have noted sadly that in addition to the five Irish citizens confirmed dead, many of the hundreds of firefighters who perished had Irish surnames.\nMore than 30 countries have reported having citizens killed or missing in the collapse of the buildings. The highest numbers come from countries like Britain, Germany, Belgium, Japan and South Korea, which are most actively in the New York financial district, and Mexico and Bangladesh, whose nationals often labor in its service sectors. Reports from Moscow tonight indicated that nearly 100 Russians are unaccounted for.\nMore than 100 Britons appear to have been trapped in the buildings when they were destroyed. Many others escaped and told their stories to British newspapers, which filled their pages today with admiring accounts of the stoicism of New Yorkers under siege and the courage of emergency workers. They also published family album pictures of lost young men and women at their weddings and outdoor gatherings and cradling their infant children.\nThe expressions of grief around the world are most often directed at the American victims, but the loss of so many people from other lands has added to the sense that the catastrophe is a global one that subsumes national differences.\n''It is clear that given the likely death toll, there will be many citizens of other states who will have died,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair said at 10 Downing Street the morning after the attacks. ''I have to say that I fear significant numbers of them will be British. So in a very real and direct sense, the interests of our country are engaged.''\nThe Mexican government is seeking information on more than 150 of its nationals who are missing. The foreign minister, Jorge G. Castañeda, told the Mexican Senate on Thursday, ''These attacks were not only acts against the United States, against democracy and against civilization, they were also attacks against dozens, hundreds and perhaps thousands of Mexicans.''\nIn the City of London financial district, bankers and traders felt a kinship with their American counterparts born of daily conversations. In interviews with British television this week, they have been expressing pained bewilderment that there is no longer any answer at the other end.\nLondon workers for Carr Futures were said to have been in direct contact with their New York colleagues during the panicked aftermath and heard anguished pleas for help. The Daily Telegraph quoted an unidentified banker here as saying, ''The London guys deal on an open outcry basis, where they shout over orders to New York, so they had speakers on their desks. They are all traumatized by what they heard.''","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"07403aff-d5a4-4601-ad6e-226ab82f4568","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:21:49.516+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"08282ce2-91ed-486c-b788-8cfb8fb7ac67","content":"TELEVISION REVIEW; The Family That Shaped Modern India\n1998-01-07T05:00:00.000Z\nFor sheer color, a history of India seems made for television, yet it also seems too big and unmanageable to fit into a few hours on a small screen.

Half of the three-hour program, focusing on Jawaharlal Nehru, covers the period that inspired hope around the world, when the nation pursued Mohandas K. Gandhi's vision of freedom through nonviolence.\nIt fell to the rich, upper-caste, somewhat dandyish Anglophile lawyers, Motilal Nehru and his son, Jawaharlal, to extract the jewel from the British Crown. Moved by a uniquely Indian combination of spiritual strength and Western political ideals (''England for us was the world,'' a Nehru relative says), the young Jawaharlal went from Harrow-Cambridge to Indian jails, from Savile Row suits to village-made dhoti, from ''brown sahib'' to socialist. The end of World War II and of Britain as the colonial power made Nehru Prime Minister of an independent India.\nIt's a compelling story, vigorously told, albeit by an overly emphatic narrator, through flavorful newsreels and the recollections of family members and colleagues, journalists and historians. It even has a romantic aspect -- ''a grand affair of the heart,'' the narrator calls it -- involving Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten, wife of the British Viceroy who was given the complicated job of granting freedom to India. The relationship is treated delicately here, but there was gossip, and the rare photographs of a happy-looking Nehru are mainly in Lady Mountbatten's company. Not that the man had much to laugh about.\nIndependence brought his country's division and massacres of Hindus and Muslims, the assassination of Gandhi and an invasion by Communist China, to which Nehru had looked for an alliance. His vision of third world solidarity proved fanciful. The pictures show him aging fast, and his death in 1964 brought his daughter Indira to power.\nThe program's portrait of Indira Gandhi (no relation to Mahatma Gandhi) is fascinating if not inspiring. By this account, her volatile rule combined elements of paranoia, populism and a hunger for power that verged on tyranny. Her popularity rose with her success in abetting Bangladesh's breakaway from Pakistan and fell with revelations of nepotism and corruption.\nViolent death pursued the family. Mrs. Gandhi's dependence on her younger son, Sanjay, ended with his death in an air crash, and when she herself was killed by a Sikh guard in 1984 (inciting violence against Sikhs around the country), her other son, Rajiv, assumed power for five years. With his assassination in an election campaign in 1991, the dynasty seemed shattered. But, as the narrator notes, Rajiv's children, Rahul and Priyanka, survive, and their heritage remains potent.\nTHE DYNASTY\nThe Nehru-Gandhi Story\nPBS, tonight\n(Channel 13, New York, at 8)\nFor WGBH/Boston, Zvi Dor-Ner, executive producer; for Brook Associates/London, Phillip Whitehead.

It was too early for government officials and independent relief workers to quantify the total scale of damage, though it was clear that by Bangladeshi standards, the impact would likely be relatively low.\nIn 1991, a tropical storm claimed roughly 140,000 lives. Bangladeshi relief agencies have since then developed early warning systems and storm shelters to help people evacuate before disaster strikes.\nThe Associated Press reported that 650,000 people had moved out of their homes.\nThe storm weakened by Friday. Still, it brought distress to some of the most vulnerable people on Earth.\nPreliminary reports from the fragile delta regions of the Bay of Bengal indicated that rivers had swelled so high that water punched through mud embankments and washed away paddy and vegetable fields, ruining the year's earnings for peasants who live off of those lands.\nIn one district, called Shatkhira, according to local journalists, roughly 5,000 mud homes collapsed back into the ground. Local relief workers for Caritas, the Catholic relief agency, reported that an entire island in Barisal district was submerged under at least six feet of water and houses were blown away by winds.\nEven the capital, Dhaka, though not directly in the path of the storm, felt its punch. Electricity towers were down, darkening the entire country for several hours overnight, and much of Dhaka remained without power for most of the day Friday, which also pinched the water supply.\nRelief and rehabilitation efforts are likely to be a crucial test for the army-backed caretaker government in charge of Bangladesh.\nThe Indian side of the Bay of Bengal delta was largely spared. Government officials there estimated that 100,000 people had left their homes in search of safety, and while some trees and roofs had been blown away on the deltaic islands known as the Sunderbans, no casualties were reported and people had already begun returning home.\nThe United Nations Development Program, in pressing world leaders to take immediate steps to address climate change, argues that the increased frequency of droughts, floods and storms stands to hit the world's poor hardest and exacerbate poverty in places like Bangladesh. The agency is due to come out with details in its annual Human Development Report later this month.\nJulfikar Ali Manik contributed reporting from Dhaka.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[{"tagged_token_id":"e53acce3-3202-4ce2-bed5-bc0bd36af93e","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"0a99d538-4a52-409b-9f7b-22719a28a722","start":439,"end":465,"tag":"fatalities","tag_id":"69f4e5af-f7a5-4631-aaf4-2f4704e347d5","value":"350 people had been killed","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:26:20.772+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"b93e4d49-00b4-4ce1-9847-aea650b6463e","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"0a99d538-4a52-409b-9f7b-22719a28a722","start":2420,"end":2475,"tag":"people displaced","tag_id":"4d4b0aa8-16e5-4874-bd1e-24b9130c8835","value":"100,000 people had left their homes in search of safety","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:31:38.596+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"17209594-32ad-4f0d-bf45-f38db25588a4","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"0a99d538-4a52-409b-9f7b-22719a28a722","start":1161,"end":1204,"tag":"people displaced","tag_id":"4d4b0aa8-16e5-4874-bd1e-24b9130c8835","value":"650,000 people had moved out of their homes","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:28:45.812+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"4aa8e304-e8e5-4d65-985d-e16a1d0eab94","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"0a99d538-4a52-409b-9f7b-22719a28a722","start":1784,"end":1808,"tag":"District","tag_id":"88258074-622f-4734-bbe1-382e03091b16","value":"entire island in Barisal","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:30:04.012+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"091d11b8-c7cc-4282-9b1e-dee9346709b6","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"0a99d538-4a52-409b-9f7b-22719a28a722","start":1657,"end":1682,"tag":"houses affected","tag_id":"b9c0eba3-c255-42cc-af6d-5cd27cb4b73c","value":"5,000 mud homes collapsed","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:29:36.244+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"cadcad2d-6af0-4e7e-ac15-40f3f288187a","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"0a99d538-4a52-409b-9f7b-22719a28a722","start":1606,"end":1615,"tag":"District","tag_id":"88258074-622f-4734-bbe1-382e03091b16","value":"Shatkhira","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:29:13.948+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"62eb401b-08af-4abd-b979-f927337a0fce","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"0a99d538-4a52-409b-9f7b-22719a28a722","start":130,"end":137,"tag":"Flood type","tag_id":"6de6f201-e6f3-46be-845f-21a8d8190680","value":"cyclone","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:25:35.117+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"c8ebe3ca-64e2-4ce6-b154-43b4bed97aec","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"0a99d538-4a52-409b-9f7b-22719a28a722","start":2303,"end":2313,"tag":"region/geographic information","tag_id":"65feb009-90b0-4d3b-aa2c-587669701a70","value":"Bangladesh","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:32:20.027+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"0a99d538-4a52-409b-9f7b-22719a28a722","classname":"Bangladesh","class_id":"d89a6030-48e2-44b1-86d4-e64cfe3abb59","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:22:40.076+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"0f422105-c2c6-42db-a019-afbc50fda6da","content":"A NATION CHALLENGED: REINFORCEMENTS; Allies Building Force to Keep Order in a Vacuum\n2001-11-16T05:00:00.000Z\nAbout 160 British marines and American Special Operations troops flew today to Bagram airfield north of Kabul as Western nations rushed to assemble an international force to keep order in Afghan areas wrested from the Taliban.\nEight C-130 aircraft -- six British and two American -- landed at the airfield, establishing the first allied bridgehead at the base, which troops began preparing for shipments of food.\nTheir arrival came as Pentagon officials said American Special Operations forces were ''tightening the noose'' in Afghanistan as they began coordinating combat missions with Pashtun fighters in the south.\nThey also sought to make contact with Northern Alliance officers who had forwarded credible claims of capturing some Taliban commanders and at least one high-ranking Al Qaeda leader.\nIf the assertions are true, the prisoners could provide valuable intelligence about the location of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda's leader, and Mullah Muhammad Omar, chief of the Taliban.\nSince the fall of Kabul earlier this week, the focus of the war has turned to tracking down Mr. bin Laden and capturing remaining Taliban outposts in southern Afghanistan.\nThe country appeared deeply fragmented today, with rival warlords filling the power vacuum left by the departing Taliban and with Mullah Omar vowing to fight on and ''destroy America.''\nAmerica's allies signaled today that they were prepared to fill the power vacuum. British officials said more than 4,000 British troops had been put on alert for duty in Afghanistan. France said it would also send troops to keep order in northern Afghanistan, and Canada said it was prepared to send more than 1,000 soldiers.\nTurkey and Jordan have also offered forces to maintain security in Afghanistan and the United States indicated Bangladesh and Malaysia are prepared to contribute as well.\n''We need some troops on the ground both to bring order and to bring confidence to the people of Afghanistan,'' Clare Short, Britain's top official for international assistance said. ''We need to move in days.''\nThe sense of urgency in London and Paris emerged after Taliban resistance in northern Afghanistan collapsed more quickly than expected, raising fears that the unstable situation might interfere with the delivery of badly needed aid shipments.\n''Aid is not flowing as quickly as it should be because there are still security concerns,'' said Kenneth H. Bacon, the president of Refugees International and the former Pentagon spokesman.\nMr. Bacon noted that World Food Program stockpiles in Mazar-i-Sharif had been looted and that an aid convoy had been attacked.\nAnother concern is that some ethnic groups that make up the Northern Alliance might start fighting among themselves unless there is an international security presence.\nThe rapid military developments have outpaced diplomatic deliberations over how to maintain security.\nThe idea of an all-Islamic security force, recently mentioned by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, is still no more than an option.\nThe United Nations special representative for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, favors an all-Afghan force to maintain order. That may be a worthy goal, Western diplomats suggested, but not a short-term solution.\nEven as Britain and France called for urgent action, Bush administration officials acknowledged that the allies had yet to hammer out a common plan.\nThe Pentagon is wary of contributing large numbers of troops for a security force, a position that reflects its longstanding reluctance to become involved in peacekeeping operations.\n''In terms of taking U.S. forces and having them become a part of a semi-permanent peacekeeping activity in the country, I think that's highly unlikely,'' Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said.\nAmplifying the Pentagon's view, a senior Defense Department official said he thought that the Northern Alliance could provide much of the security in the north, a view the British and French clearly do not accept.\n''I would not discount the possibility that most of the security work will be done and continue to be done by the Afghans themselves, assuming the conflict with the Taliban up there is cleared up and the pockets of resistance vanish,'' said Joseph Collins, a deputy assistant secretary of defense who focuses on relief and peacekeeping issues.\nA State Department spokesman said tonight, ''When and how foreign troops might be involved in this effort is still being determined.''\nStill, the American military is prepared to support the relief effort.\nTo help coordinate aid, the Pentagon is considering the establishment of a separate military command in Pakistan. Pentagon officials said the command would include military officials from a coalition of allies, many of which have pledged troops and aircraft for aid programs. An official from an allied nation may command the force.\nAs the allies scrambled to figure out a plan to maintain order in the north, fighting continued in the south.\nAmerican Special Operations forces, coordinating combat missions with Pashtun fighters, kept up the pressure on the Taliban.\nGen. Tommy R. Franks, commander of the military operation in Afghanistan, said for the first time today that Special Forces teams were now working with anti-Taliban militias in the south to provide battlefield advice, organize resupply, offer weapons and call in strikes by American warplanes. That is what they did earlier -- and with success -- in the north, aiding the now buoyant Northern Alliance. ''We're tightening the noose,'' said General Franks, commander of the United States Central Command. ''It's a matter of time.''\nBut the Taliban forces defending their stronghold of Kandahar continued to put up tough resistance today, Pentagon officials said.\n''We are applying pressure in the vicinity of Kandahar,'' General Franks said. Although Kandahar remains under Taliban control, ''we do see signs of some fracturing there,'' he said.\nAs more of Afghanistan falls under opposition control, American forces are scouring sites where Al Qaeda is suspected of testing or producing chemical or biological weapons. ''We have no substantial findings to this point,'' said General Franks.\nFierce fighting continued today in the northern city of Kunduz, where the Northern Alliance has trapped thousands of fighters loyal to the Taliban and Al Qaeda.\nMr. Rumsfeld and General Franks indicated that the battle for Kunduz could be particularly bloody since the enemy force has a large number of Al Qaeda's most devoted, skilled and well-armed fighters. Many are non-Afghan, which means they have few options except fighting to the end: They cannot defect to the Northern Alliance or shed their weapons and hope to fade into the local population, officials said.\nWhile American Special Operations forces are calling in airstrikes at Kunduz, concern about civilian deaths has prevented heavy bombing inside the city, officials said.\nRegarding the need for security in the north, French and British officials indicated that one arrangement under consideration would give the French responsibility for security around Mazar-i-Sharif, the northern Afghan city captured last week by the Northern Alliance, while the British would have security for Kabul and the nearby Bagram airfield, which is emerging as a crucial hub.\nFrance's defense minister, Alain Richard, said he intended to send significant numbers of French forces to Afghanistan.\n''We are working on a French contribution, probably with other coalition countries, to create a security base that would re-establish infrastructure and normal living conditions in the northern zone,'' Mr. Richard said today. The plans would be completed within days.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[{"tagged_token_id":"fa1652e7-ba45-4ef7-a3f4-dc6e8ade5ad3","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"0f422105-c2c6-42db-a019-afbc50fda6da","start":7077,"end":7142,"tag":"Flood type","tag_id":"6de6f201-e6f3-46be-845f-21a8d8190680","value":"French and British officials indicated that one arrangement under","correct":false,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:35:35.709+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"469b1af6-1b0b-4335-b0c3-b58643e8286d","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"0f422105-c2c6-42db-a019-afbc50fda6da","start":1608,"end":1983,"tag":"Flood type","tag_id":"6de6f201-e6f3-46be-845f-21a8d8190680","value":"rt for duty in Afghanistan.

But a glance at the menu immediately brightens the outlook.\nInstead of chicken tikka masala and lamb vindaloo, it is filled with regional Indian dishes, like peppery Chettinad chicken from the south, chickpea cakes flavored with chilies and cilantro from Gujarat in the west and fish bathed in herbs from the Sind. Instead of watering down flavors for Western palates, the menu states: ''Entrees are on the spicier side. Milder versions can be requested.''\nAmong Manhattan's Indian restaurants, Mirchi represents a small revolution. No longer will all menus list the same 10 dishes; it is now possible to find authentic, regional Indian cuisine at neighborhood restaurants all over the city. Simply by serving Indian food with spicing and seasoning intact, these restaurants are reinvigorating a complex and fascinating cuisine that had grown dreary with repetition. Gone are lackluster chutneys and dull curries. Instead, sparkling flavors ring out, like the sauce of mint, tamarind and yogurt on the seva batata poori, little round crisps topped with diced potatoes and crunchy slivers of lentil-flour angel hair, served at Dakshin on the Upper East Side.\n''I think the American palate has changed, and restaurateurs are taking more chances,'' said Prem Tolani, the owner of Mirchi. ''There is more awareness of Indian food in America, and that has made all the difference.''\nAlong with Mirchi, the leading edge of neighborhood Indian restaurants today includes Banjara in the East Village, for succulent tandoori dishes that recall how good clay oven cooking can be; Tiffin in lower Manhattan, for fascinating vegetarian dishes like a bright, spicy smoked tomato soup; Vatan in Murray Hill, for a parade of subtle vegetarian dishes from the western state of Gujarat; Mumbai on the Upper East Side, for Goan dishes like chicken in a curry of ground poppy seeds and coconut; and Dakshin, which also has a branch in Clinton, for beautifully seasoned south Indian specialties like chicken stir-fried with chilies, ginger and curry leaves.\nA couple of old standbys on the Upper West Side, Indian Oven and Mughlai, are also in the regional vanguard.\nThese are not high-end Indian restaurants like Dawat and Shaan, nor are they fusion restaurants like Tabla and, to a lesser extent, Tamarind, presenting French or American food with Indian seasonings. And unlike restaurants in Indian neighborhoods like Jackson Heights, Queens, these places serve a largely non-Indian clientele.\nSome of the newer places, like Mirchi, appeal to a younger generation of South Asians. Its dining room is simple and spare, with none of the copper trim and stilted formality that characterize so many other Indian restaurants. The pulsing techno music suggests a culture that has more in common with London and New York than with rural Indian villages. The bar offers fancy drinks, not to mention a wine list, rather than the usual Indian beers.\nBeyond looks and atmosphere, Mirchi is set apart because it is somewhat of a joint venture among several longtime Indian restaurateurs, including Satish Sehgal, the owner of Indian Oven, and Vijay Gupta, the owner of Mughlai and Bay Leaf in Midtown Manhattan, who are involved as consultants. For Mr. Sehgal, Mirchi has become a laboratory of sorts, for testing dishes like Jaipuri lal maas, a spicy yet subtle lamb dish made with 30 red chilies.\n''Jaipuri lal maas outsells anything on the menu,'' Mr. Sehgal said.\nNot that long ago, Indian food represented excitement for many New Yorkers. Like Sichuan restaurants in the 1960's, Indian restaurants that opened in the 70's attracted adventurous diners eager to explore the world's cuisines. ''We were serving North Indian tandoori, and we had a glass-enclosed kitchen,'' said Mr. Sehgal, who opened Indian Oven in 1975. ''It was a total performance drama.''\nIn a way, Indian restaurants were victims of their own success. As more opened around New York, they could not be sustained by the small pool of trained Indian chefs, so immigrants with little cooking experience were hired.\n''They were unskilled chefs, people in professions unrelated to food, but they needed jobs and the owners didn't care, they needed bodies,'' said Suvir Saran, a restaurant consultant, caterer and teacher. ''Bad recipes became institutionalized.''\nWhat's more, many restaurants that called themselves Indian were in fact owned and operated by Bangladeshis, like most of the Indian restaurants that line East Sixth Street in the East Village. ''I realized that many chefs were from Bangladesh and were cooking foods that they had not grown up eating,'' Mr. Saran said. ''I would ask them, 'Why don't you cook the foods you know?' And they would say the owners don't think it is right.''\nLike the sham Chinese restaurants that toss a handful of chili peppers atop chicken and call it Sichuan, many Indian restaurants came to serve poor facsimiles of authentic dishes. ''It was more of a bland kind of food,'' said Mr. Tolani of Mirchi. ''That's what they thought Americans wanted.''\nPerhaps Americans did want that, at one time, but tastes evolved in the 1990's. Whether traveling to India or to London, where Indian restaurants are as British as a pint in a pub, many Americans have had more opportunities to sample Indian dishes in their full aromatic glory. And they've begun to understand that India, like Italy and China, has no single, monolithic cuisine. Instead, Indian food comprises many different styles of cooking, each a product of regional influences, from the fiery vegetarian dishes of the south to the Portuguese-influenced Goan cooking of the west to the more familiar Mogul food of the north.\nOf course, anybody who really wanted good Indian food could find it in Indian neighborhoods like Jackson Heights, while taxi driver hole-in-the-walls like the Eat Again Deli in Chelsea offer unusual specialties like makai ki roti, a grainy cornmeal flatbread, though in less-than-comfortable surroundings.\nNew excitement arrived in Manhattan in the early and mid-90's, when southern Indian restaurants like Madras Mahal, Mavalli Palace and Pongal began opening around Lexington Avenue in the 20's, serving two-foot-long masala dosas, crepes stuffed with potatoes and onions, which were visually astounding and delicious.\nFor old-timers like Mr. Sehgal and Mr. Gupta, expanding the repertory of the Indian kitchen is partly a matter of national pride, but also a question of survival.\n''I was getting worried about the tikka masala thing,'' Mr. Sehgal said. ''You have to position yourself with something different when the competition is increasing.''\nSo, over the years, Mr. Sehgal has added regional dishes to his menu. Now, he serves dosas from southern India; safed maas, lamb or chicken cooked with green chilies and coconut, from Rajasthan in the northwest; and subtle, delicate dum pukhts from the northeast, in which lamb, chicken and vegetables are cooked in a sealed vessel.\n''Across the board, people are responding to regionalism,'' said Michael Batterberry, a founder of Food Arts magazine.\nMany people who know little about Indian food have been willing to try Tabla, the Indian-fusion restaurant, where the high-end comforts and the Danny Meyer imprimatur allay fears of the unfamiliar.\n''When we opened three years ago, a lot of people said they didn't like Indian food,'' said Floyd Cardoz, the chef at Tabla. ''They'd say, 'Where's the chicken masala?' -- not realizing that there are 36 different Indian states, each with at least three cuisines.''\nNonetheless, Mr. Cardoz, who came to the United States from India in 1989, says that Americans are willing to try new dishes. What's more, he adds, as Indians themselves see the improvements in Indian restaurants, they, too, are going out more, which in turn raises the bar for restaurants. ''With these smaller restaurants opening up, I'm very excited about Indian cuisine and where it's going,'' Mr. Cardoz said.\nFew places illustrate the changing face of Manhattan's Indian restaurants like Banjara, which opened several months ago in the East Village. From its corner perch at First Avenue and Sixth Street, it anchors one end of the end-to-end block of Indian restaurants that gained popularity in the 80's. But nobody would say that Banjara gets its food from the mythical single kitchen that supplies the others.\nThe chef, Tuhin Dutta, who studied at the French Culinary Institute, experiments with fusion dishes like sharabi kababi, chicken marinated in wine and served with prunes. For more traditional fare, Mr. Dutta offers Goan-style chicken with roasted coconut, and dum pukhts, a specialty of the northeastern city of Lucknow, fragrant chunks of chicken or lamb in a velvety beige sauce, served in copper vessels covered with a skin of pastry. And if you want to remember why people once flocked to Banjara's Sixth Street neighbors, the tandoori-cooked chicken and lamb are superb.\nMore Than Tandoori\nTHESE restaurants now offer regional dishes.\nBANJARA, 97 First Avenue, at Sixth Street; (212) 477-5956.\nDAKSHIN -- 741 Ninth Avenue, at 50th Street; (212) 757-4545.

Then the refrigerator. Soon the walls, made of palm fronds and sticks of wood lashed together, and the corrugated tin roof collapsed. Ms. Salgado's youngest child, 1 1/2-year-old Victor Antonio, vanished in the debris.\nMore than two weeks later, the refrigerator is still lying in a foot of stagnant water. The boy has not been found. Ms. Salgado cries as she stands in the ruins and looks at the concrete-block house of her wealthier next-door neighbor, which was untouched by the storm.\nThat poverty was the main characteristic of Mitch's victims is not the only man-made aspect of this natural disaster. El Salvador's national emergency agency concentrates on helping victims after disaster strikes, not warning or evacuating people beforehand. Another huge factor was environmental neglect. Many scientists believe that global warming contributed to this year's devastating floods -- in China and Bangladesh as well as the Caribbean and Central America -- and, conversely, to droughts and forest fires elsewhere. Locally, deforestation multiplied Mitch's damage. Five days of torrential rain would have caused damage anywhere, but there would have been fewer lethal mud slides if the land in Honduras and Nicaragua had been covered with trees. Central America is one of the most deforested parts of the world, losing 118 acres of trees an hour.\nEl Salvador lost only a few people from mudslides. But environmentalists here say deforestation swelled the flood waters that took Victor Antonio and left 239 others dead, 84,000 homeless and the country's water, agriculture and health in tatters.\nTrees hold the soil together and help it absorb rain. When the land is stripped of trees, heavy rains sweep mud and minerals into the rivers, swelling and clotting the water and increasing its power to destroy. The erosion caused by Mitch will speed this vicious circle and increase the destructive power of future storms.\nDeforestation has other consequences. It reduces soil fertility, crucial in a country of subsistence farmers. In addition, because less rain is reaching the subsoil, aquifers dry up and the country begins to run out of water. San Salvador's water table drops a meter a year.\nIn Honduras, commercial logging, much of it aimed at North American markets, causes some of the deforestation. El Salvador has no logging, but its deforestation is the worst in the hemisphere after Haiti. The most fertile land was cleared for cotton and coffee plantations. (Most of El Salvador's coffee needs shade, and thus requires the conservation of some trees.) Small farmers were pushed onto hilly terrain, where the soil is so poor that they must keep moving, clearing new land. Developers also cut down forests to build houses, often in violation of the country's poorly enforced environmental laws.\nThe storm is a sign that environmental concerns are no middle-class luxury. It is a call to everyone to reduce greenhouse gases, and a warning to nations like El Salvador to plant more trees, enforce environmental laws and devise strategies for development that do not depend on deforestation.\nThese projects are long-term -- a phrase that in these parts often means ''never'' -- and may now be less likely to happen because Mitch has created so many overwhelming and expensive needs. But as Central America tries to rebuild, it must keep the environment, and the likelihood of future flooding, in mind.\nEspecially in El Salvador, the most densely populated nation in the hemisphere, it will be hard to find places for the homeless that are not in forests, on slopes or in flood-prone river basins. At the very least, new housing should be made of concrete blocks. A private-enterprise group has promised to build storm-resistant houses in a devastated town near El Cuco, but the building material the Government promises the grief-stricken Ms. Salgado is flimsy corrugated tin. It has not yet come, and the house is as it was, half submerged in water.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"1074cbfb-2ab9-4393-9b88-9ba334265123","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:38:17.661+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"1102b47d-dd07-4614-8059-73c0b8e282f9","content":"Food as Ritual, Dining as Theater; Then as Now, New York Sates Its Hungers in Public\n1998-12-01T05:00:00.000Z\nAlong a narrow hallway deep inside the Beaux Arts palace known as the New-York Historical Society, there is a single wall of artifacts from 100 years ago. It tells the story of food in New York City at the turn of this century. And it inspires a peculiar sense of deja vu.\nThere is a produce list from a downtown market, featuring sorrel and huckleberries and all manner of lettuce, with no iceberg in sight. There is a carefully posed tableau inside Sherry's, a fashionable, decidedly French restaurant in midtown, where what you ate mattered almost as much as who was at the next table.\nPerhaps 100 years from now, there will be an exhibition culled from our own turn of the century. Included perhaps will be a photograph of the Greenmarket at Union Square, with bunches of sorrel and exotic berries and lettuce varieties, sans iceberg of course. Or an image of the gloriously Parisian dining room at Balthazar in SoHo, with a caption describing the rituals of its famous patrons; something about, say, how Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne have dinner there virtually every Friday evening.\nThe historical society's exhibition, ''From Pushcarts to Restaurants DeLuxe: Dining in New York at the Turn of the Century,'' invites such ruminations about the present not just for these similarities, but because the rituals of eating have always spoken volumes about a place, any place, but particularly New York.\nSo, looking back from what we think of as our singularly food-obsessed era, what difference has a century made in the eating habits of New Yorkers?\n''In a lot of ways, they're very similar,'' Mary Beth Betts, the exhibition's curator, said the other day. ''New York has always been a kind of restaurant town.''\nIn ways that go well beyond food, the turn-of-the-century city prefigured the New York of today. Like the end of the 20th century, the end of the 19th in New York was a time of radical technological advance, when Manhattan was cementing its place as a financial and informational capital. Poor people from all over the world flocked to New York in search of work and freedom, and made a great many rich people richer.\nThen as now, New Yorkers were in a rush. The city was dotted with coffee cake saloons, where 2 cents bought hot coffee and a piece of cake, and quick-lunch houses, where office workers could gobble down a steak lunch for 10 cents.\nBack then, New Yorkers ate out because they were wealthy enough not to have to cook, Ms. Betts said, or because they were too poor to afford an apartment with a kitchen.\nBut the eating artifacts from a century ago also suggest the other, less tangible reasons people chose to eat out, just as we do now. They ate out for the theater of it, to indulge in the outrageous. A banquet at Sherry's required guests to dine on horseback and sip Champagne through straws from their saddlebags, wrote Michael and Arianne Batterberry in ''On the Town in New York,'' recently reissued by Routledge.\nThey ate out to soak up the noise of a crowd, to cure that perennial, professional affliction of the New Yorker: loneliness.\nAnd they ate out to sate homesickness, to remember, with a bagel or a bowl of chow fun -- for those were not yet considered native foods -- all they had left behind. Look at the picture of the knish shop on Rivington Street, taken in 1900, or the faces of the men inside a Chinatown restaurant in 1896. Doesn't this hunger for home help to explain, even now, the lure of the salmon croquettes at Carmichael's, the soul food diner in St. Albans, Queens, or the crispy onion fritters that fill up Sugandha, in the Bangladeshi section of Kensington, Brooklyn, on a Sunday afternoon, or the 24-hour Korean barbecue spots in midtown, where Korean immigrants meet for after-hours kimchi and marinated beef?\nThe exhibition, which runs through mid-February at the society, Central Park West at 77th Street, is plucked from the organization's vast collection of food souvenirs from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century.\nAgain and again, the parallels are striking.\nThere was a vast gap between rich and poor. For the poor, there were oyster peddlers on the street -- recurrent cases of typhoid shut them down by the 1920's -- and taverns, where sausages, sardines and other salty foods were served free, to entice patrons to buy more beer. For the moneyed, there were lobster palaces. Restaurants like Sherry's and Delmonico's competed fiercely for the attention of the elite, who in turn competed fiercely to flaunt their wealth, giving ostentatious banquets with party favors like silver grape scissors for the ladies.\n''People had money, and felt comfortable spending it on food,'' Ms. Betts said.\nThere was a great concern about clean, healthy living, giving rise not only to the antiseptic chains like Child's, but also to the temperance movement that shut down the free lunch taverns.\nAmong its best-known figures was a Kansas prohibitionist, Carry Nation, ''a weird little figure behind whom misguided idealists, incipient vandals, and generally repressed Victorians could orgiastically rally in the names of Motherhood and Morality, Piety and Prohibition,'' the Batterberrys wrote.\n''With her symbolic, but useful, hatchet in hand,'' they continued, ''Carry set out to physically destroy every saloon in the country.''\nCarry Nation is now the name of a bar on the southwestern fringe of Park Slope. Smoking is allowed there.\nOf course, it would be incorrect to neglect the great differences between the two turns of the centuries.\nAt the Fulton Street market, circa 1880-1890, bear was on the menu. Whole bears, that is. And partridges, sold in pairs for $1.75.\nThere were no food critics to rate restaurants, though gossip writers did comment on who dined where.\nAt expensive restaurants, servings were generous, for 100 years ago, a waif was the picture of malnutrition, not model material.\nBlack diners were not allowed there, nor at many of the white working men's taverns either. Whites of lowly origin were allowed, so long as they could use the right forks.\nPerhaps what has changed most of all, food experts say, is the sheer breadth of culinary options.\n''At the turn of the century, there was a certain degree of xenophobia,'' Michael Batterberry said the other day. '' 'Foreign food,' in quotes, was not a desirable pursuit. The types of food that people ate when they ate out were far narrower than it is today.''\nWith immigration at peak levels, ethnic restaurants catered to their own. Knish shops dotted the Lower East Side; Yonah Shimmel's on Houston Street opened in 1910. Noodle houses on Mott Street found a rare visitor who wasn't a Chinese man, and it was indeed mostly men, because the Chinese were not allowed to bring their wives. Spaghetti would be served only in Little Italy.\nFor all but the immigrant masses, the acceptable foreign foods tended to be French, which was served in the finest restaurants in town. German pubs, Luchow's being the most famous, were also popular. By the end of the 19th century, Germans were regarded as having joined the American mainstream, unlike Italians or East European Jews. Chinese food was sampled only by bohemians and curious journalists.\nToday, New York food experts talk proudly of the great variety of restaurants offering the finest of the world's cuisines: Zarela for Mexican, Dawat for Indian, Shun Lee Palace for Chinese.\nBut lest we celebrate the openness of the current era too much, it should be noted that an epicurean hierarchy persists. Try persuading Manhattanites who routinely spend $60 apiece at Balthazar to spend half that amount on a meal in Chinatown, as the radio talk show host and gourmand-about-town, Leonard Lopate, has on many occasions. They widen their eyes in disbelief.\n''People are ready to spend the most money on French food, now Italian food, and everything from a celebrity chef,'' he said. ''They've been spoiled. French food has always been expensive. Chinese food has always been cheap.''","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"1102b47d-dd07-4614-8059-73c0b8e282f9","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T05:41:36.798+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"123c4a90-e153-4d42-9e7c-a5858fc24b67","content":"NEWS SUMMARY\n1998-11-10T05:00:00.000Z\nINTERNATIONAL A3-16\nArsenic Poses Threat To Millions in Bangladesh\nBangladesh is in the midst of what some experts say could be the biggest mass poisoning in history.

Climbing inflation was compounded by an unusually harsh monsoon, which destroyed food crops along the flood plains in July. \nThen, the Nov. 15 cyclone destroyed acres of rice paddy, ruined the shrimp farms that dot the southern coast, and, according to the World Food Program, left roughly 2.3 million people in need of urgent food aid.\nStorm relief is now the government’s most pressing test, including averting famine and disease outbreaks, and ensuring that aid distribution is perceived to be fair and without corruption. The government estimates that six million people were affected by the storm. \n“This is going to be the real defining challenge for them,” Rehman Sobhan, the chairman of the Center for Policy Dialogue, an independent research group based in Dhaka, said of the administration. “A huge effort is going to be required.”\nBangladesh is among the world’s poorest nations, with a Muslim-majority population of more than 140 million and nearly half of its youngest children suffering from malnutrition. Polls indicate that even before the cyclone, confidence in the caretaker government was declining.\nThe way the ordinary Bangladeshi is being pinched every day was on stark display the other day in a working-class quarter of Dhaka called Begunbari, a crowded warren of tenements amid the roar of factories that supply cheap clothes for sale abroad, including in the United States.\nAbdul Aziz, 63, a security guard who was buying vegetables at the local market, quietly confessed that even with three grown daughters working in the garment industry, his family was finding it harder to put enough food on the table. On this afternoon, he bought half as many winter beans as he had hoped to and one small head of cauliflower instead of two. Those purchases, along with the staple rice and lentils, would have to feed his family of seven. “We will make do,” he said. “Everyone will have a little bit.”\nA tailor who serves the neighborhood said his business had plummeted from about 50 orders a day to barely a couple. Few can afford new clothes when the basics — onions, oil, cauliflower — have become so much costlier.\n Firoza Begum, the wife of a civil servant, said the government had failed to curb food prices, even as she gave it credit for cracking down on graft.\n “They have caught some corrupt people — we can see that,” she said. “But we also want them to reduce prices of our daily needs, so we can somehow manage our households.”\nShe said that she had all but given up buying milk and meat for her family because they were too expensive.\nIn her neighborhood, Election Commission workers were going door to door this afternoon taking names and addresses so they could compile a fresh list of those eligible to vote. Fakhruddin Ahmed, the civilian leader of the country’s military-backed caretaker administration, has promised national elections by the end of 2008.\n But exactly how soon elections will take place and under what circumstances, remain mysteries, considering that several major politicians are in jail or in exile. The leaders of the two top political parties, Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and Sheik Hasina Wazed of the Awami League, are in custody on various graft and extortion charges. Whether they will be allowed to take part in the election is anyone’s guess.\nUnder emergency rule, the press is prohibited from publishing anything deemed “provocative” and political activity is banned, including demonstrations. Holding a political meeting outdoors is punishable by up to five years in prison. \nThe restrictions were loosened slightly in September when indoor political meetings were allowed to resume, but only with permission from the police and with no more than 50 people in attendance.\n According to a monthly public perception survey by a consortium of civil society organizations called the Election Working Group, the share of Bangladeshis who expressed high confidence in the caretaker government fell between March and September, while the share of those who had low confidence sharply increased. This was true of respondents from “ordinary” and “elite” socioeconomic groups.\nIn the latest survey, conducted in face-to-face interviews in late September, the rising price of essential commodities was identified as the biggest concern, and even as the government got good marks for cracking down on corruption, respondents were divided about whether the government had any bearing on their daily lives: 42 percent of them said they were “better off” but about the same percentage said they were “worse off or that there has been no change in their personal situation.”\nThe government’s anticorruption crusade continues to be seen as a turning point for Bangladesh, which has consistently ranked at the bottom of the annual Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. \nBank accounts have been frozen. Luxury cars have been impounded by the state, or hidden indoors by their owners for fear they will be taken. Nearly 100 prominent politicians and business people have been taken in for questioning, and an unknown number of people have been detained without charge, which is legal under the new emergency laws. A little more than a dozen have been convicted by anticorruption courts, and how quickly, or fairly, the other cases will be tried is unclear.\n If entrenched corruption was seen as damaging the economy, the crackdown has also sent shocks through the private sector. The government appears to be retreating from its initial wide sweep and has in recent months, released some detainees.\n“Informally, the government wants some sort of reassurance for the business community that they will be allowed to function,” said Akbar Ali Khan, a retired senior government official. He declined to grade the government’s overall performance (criticizing the government is now a punishable offense) except to say that it was vital for the government to prepare for elections and restore business leaders’ confidence in the country.\n“The economic problems are very serious and acute,” he said. “These will have to be addressed with more vigor.”\nAbdul Awal Mintoo, the chairman and chief executive of Multimode Group, was among the most prominent millionaires taken into custody in May on a vague charge of destabilizing the government, then released six months later. Mr. Mintoo said that while he was in custody he was interrogated less about his own assets than about what evidence he could furnish against Ms. Hasina, the Awami League leader and a former prime minister with whom Mr. Mintoo was friendly.\n A naturalized United States citizen, Mr. Mintoo returned to his native Bangladesh 27 years ago and established a number of businesses, from dealing in agricultural seeds to real estate. He estimates his assets in Bangladesh to be $30 million.\nMr. Mintoo, 58, insists that he did not bribe anyone in government in exchange for contracts. But he concedes that he did what he says everyone else has long had to do in this country: grease the wheels of politics and government to get basic things done, including installing a telephone line and getting imported machine parts out of customs. If that were the grounds for his arrest, he said, then “50 million people, every adult male” should be arrested.\n“It’s aimless what they’re doing,” he said of the government in an interview, and added that he planned to divest himself of his investments in the country slowly. “I’m not sure how this will end up. I don’t want to take a risk and live in uncertainty.”\n“If you take blood out of the arteries,” he added, “it just paralyzes.”\nThe only charge remaining pending against Mr. Mintoo accuses him of extorting about $700 from a private citizen. Mr. Mintoo laughed at the charge, saying it was too paltry a sum for him to demand of anyone.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"15fa2afa-97ca-4a3b-846b-6b658b698067","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T06:31:08.251+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"183ec45f-55eb-41c4-8471-8ce365e67e67","content":"New Premier in Bangladesh Vows to Stamp Out Corruption\n2001-10-11T05:00:00.000Z\nKhaleda Zia, a nationalist leader, was sworn in this evening as prime minister of Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest and most populous nations, after an election in which a surprising 75 percent of the registered voters went to the polls.\nShe swept to victory with a campaign against lawlessness and corruption, but it was her Bangladesh Nationalist Party's disciplined alliance with two Islamic parties and another small faction that ensured the coalition's lopsided majority in the new Parliament.\n''My government's first priority will be to eliminate terrorism and stamp out corruption,'' Mrs. Zia said after the ceremony. ''We will also try to ensure economic emancipation for the vast majority.''\nMrs. Zia, 57, widow of an assassinated military dictator, succeeds Sheik Hasina Wazed, 55, daughter of the nation's first elected leader, Sheik Mujibur Rahman, who was killed by army officers in 1975. The rivalry of the two women, both scarred by the country's experience of political violence, has long defined the politics of Bangladesh.\nMrs. Zia, who organized many general strikes in failed attempts to bring down Mrs. Hasina's government in the last five years, has encouraged Mrs. Hasina to take her place as leader of the opposition.\nBut Mrs. Hasina, who heads the Awami League and is the first Bangladeshi leader to serve a full five-year term as prime minister, boycotted tonight's swearing-in. She said those elected from her party would boycott Parliament.\nShe has rejected the verdict of 56 million voters, though international monitors concluded that the elections, held on Oct. 1, had been free and fair.\n''Yes, I did commit that I would accept the election results,'' Mrs. Hasina said at a news conference on Tuesday in Dhaka, ''but I did not commit to accept rigged results.''\nMrs. Hasina's stance threatens more political turbulence. She called for a protest today from 6 a.m. to noon. Traffic was lighter than usual in Dhaka, the congested capital, which is home to nine million people, but the day passed peacefully.\nThat was exceptional. In the 10 days since the election, more than 40 people have been killed in political violence. Most victims have been associated with the Awami League, the Dhaka newspaper Daily Star reported today.\nAlready there are signs that Mrs. Zia's promise to halt lawlessness is running up against the power of local gangs associated with her party.\nBangladesh is plagued by unemployed young men who do the dirty work of political parties at the local level, enforcing calls for strikes, rustling up people for rallies and intimidating opposition voters. In return, the parties look the other way when the thugs commit crimes.\nNow that Mrs. Zia has come to power, people associated with her party have begun taking over extortion operations at bus terminals, truck stops and markets that were worked by the Awami League when it was in power, Bangladeshi newspapers report.\nVoters said it was a rise in criminality and public corruption, especially in Dhaka and other urban areas, that had motivated them to vote Mrs. Hasina out of office.\n''It was a big relief,'' said Hamida Tarafdar, 62, a widow who lives in Dhaka with her son and daughter-in-law. ''Now I feel we can sleep at night in peace.''\nFalan Mia, who runs a grocery, echoed the sentiment. ''It only vindicates that Allah is there,'' he said. ''We simply got fed up with the Awami thugs who regularly came to extort money from us.''\nBut in the end the arithmetic of coalition politics may have been even more salient than law and order. The Awami League won 40.5 percent of the popular vote, a larger share than it garnered in 1996 and more than the 36 percent won by Mrs. Zia and her nationalist party.\nIn many ways, the Awami League's popularity is not surprising. During Mrs. Hasina's tenure, the economy has been growing at a healthy rate of 5 to 7 percent a year, poverty and the birthrate have fallen and Bangladesh has become self-sufficient in food production.\nBut Mrs. Zia overcame Awami's electoral advantage through an alliance with the three other parties, which brought her coalition's portion of the vote to 46 percent.\nIt is Mrs. Zia's alliance with the Jamaat-e-Islami, which wants to turn Bangladesh into a republic ruled by Islamic law, that secular Bangladeshis find most worrisome.\n''Jamaat has been a nuisance, but never an electoral power,'' said Gowher Rizvi, a Bangladeshi who leads the Ford Foundation's South Asia office in New Delhi. ''We will see more intolerance, more emphasis on Islamization. And groups like the Grameen Bank that are involved in women's empowerment will suffer.''\nWhile Mrs. Zia has been supportive of the American campaign to capture Osama bin Laden, the Jamaat leader, Matiur Rahman Nizami, said in an interview that the United States did not have enough evidence against Mr. bin Laden to justify military attacks and warned that the bombing ''would definitely cause widespread anger and revulsion in the entire Muslim world.''\nThe question is how much power the Jamaat will exercise in the new government, in which it holds two of the 59 ministerial posts.\nThe election itself was wondrous to behold, say monitors who went out into the field on Oct. 1.\nFor 16 years Bangladesh was ruled by military dictators. In the last decade, the country has struggled to re-establish a functioning democracy. On Oct. 1, millions of people voted for the first time. And women, often oppressed in the largely rural society, voted in the largest proportion ever.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"183ec45f-55eb-41c4-8471-8ce365e67e67","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T06:31:58.362+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"188fef43-2fa0-4d4a-822f-ac908ba87463","content":"South Asia struggles with devastation from flooding\n2007-08-05T05:00:00.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh — Nothing tests the mettle of government in this part of the world more than a fierce monsoon, as unusually heavy rains across South Asia showed in the past week, leaving a trail of death and ruin and raising the risk of disease.\nFreak rains, which scientists describe as a hallmark of climate change, seemed to be responsible. The devastation was all the more severe because flimsy dams and embankments collapsed under the weight of floodwaters. The mud houses of the poor were the first to wash away.\nWeather scientists have said South Asia is likely to get much more unpredictable rain in the coming decades, bringing greater challenges for its governments to prepare and cope with nature's fury. In Bangladesh, which is perennially inundated because so much of it is low-lying delta, more than half of the districts were under water.\nMore than one million families were affected by flooding, according to government officials. [The Associated Press reported Sunday that the death toll in Bangladesh had risen to 120 and that of India to 169.]\nAccording to the country's Meteorological Department, Bangladesh received just under 73 centimeters, or 29 inches, of rain in July, double the average. Bangladesh also felt the brunt of greater rain upstream in northern and northeastern India, as rivers broke through their banks on their way down to the Bay of Bengal, said Saiful Hossain, executive engineer of the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center.\nThe flooding has presented the country's army-backed government, which took power in January, with its latest and perhaps toughest challenge. Its impact could already be felt far beyond the flood-affected districts. Prices of essential commodities have spiked in recent weeks because flooded roads have disrupted transportation links.\nAs in all floods every year, nature shared blame with human negligence. A flood protection dam was badly damaged this year.\nIn Nepal, unremitting rains for the last two weeks flooded entire swaths across the heavily populated southern plains, on the border with India. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that up to 300,000 people were in need of water, food and other humanitarian supplies.\nNearly 10,000 people were displaced, and 84 had been killed, said Paul Handley, a field coordinator with the agency.\nNepal, too, is accustomed to floods each year. But the unusually heavy rains this year seem to have affected more of the country.\nThe United Nations and aid agencies in Nepal have already nearly exhausted their supplies of food and other goods, Handley said, although the monsoon season was not expected to end for at least another month.\nIn India, the monsoon's destruction reached to the north and northeast last week. The death toll since the start of the monsoon season in June stood at 1,225, according to the Home Ministry.\nThe military has been deployed to Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where more than 12 million people have been affected by flooding over the last week. The Indian Air Force dropped food packets to displaced people in Bihar on Saturday, according to The Press Trust of India.\nJulfikar Ali Manik reported from Dhaka and Somini Sengupta from Bangalore, India.

Aide Finds a Home in South Bronx\n1998-11-15T05:00:00.000Z\nSAM OGLESBY had worked overseas in economic development for the United Nations for 25 years, living in Thailand, Burma, Indonesia, Bhutan and Bangladesh.\nIn 1989 he was back in New York, working at the headquarters and living in a studio apartment on the Upper West Side. Because he liked walking, he spent hours roaming through the city's neighborhoods and found himself charmed by brownstones. He decided he had to have one of his own.\nWith the eyes of a stranger, he visited places like Brooklyn Heights, Park Slope, Carroll Gardens and Boerum Hill. But he had only $200,000 to spend, and even five years ago, when he really began his search for a house, they were out of reach. He wanted something architecturally interesting, and no more than 30 minutes from midtown.\nRelatively quickly, he became enamored of Harlem, attracted to its atmosphere and its history. But he had no luck. Maybe it was timing. Maybe he wasn't decisive enough. In 1996, he almost bought a house in Morningside Valley for $90,000, but while he was worrying that it would be too complicated to untangle its problematic certificate of occupancy, someone else bought the house. Frustrated and disappointed, he gave up.\nBut after a while, reinvigorated by an article that described the Mount Morris area in Harlem, he began exploring there. One day about six months ago, walking on Fifth Avenue near 125th Street, he approached a man sitting on a stoop and asked him if he knew of any houses for sale in the neighborhood.\nThe man said no, but he did know of a landmarked block in the South Bronx with a house for sale. The man, it turned out, was a real estate broker, and he arranged to show Mr. Oglesby the house at 419 East 140th Street in the Mott Haven section, where most of the residents are Spanish-speaking. On the day of their appointment, Mr. Oglesby took the Lexington Avenue subway to 138th Street, which is only 15 minutes from midtown.\nWhen he walked out of the subway and up 138th Street, he found himself in a place that reminded him of the developing countries where he had lived.\n''The shops are very simple, and poor,'' he said, ''with big plantains and yams and mangoes, not plastic tomatoes. The little Mexican grocery store has music blaring out, and there are people hanging out on the street. There is one kind of toothpaste, not 10.''\nHe had liked the idea of living in Harlem, but never quite felt accepted. In Mott Haven, he said, he felt like he had come home.\nWhen he reached East 140th Street, which is lined with well-tended houses of different colors, ''it was suddenly like a 1950's sitcom,'' he said, adding that ''people were tending their gardens and smiling and talking.''\nIT was not at all like the Upper West Side. ''There you're lucky if you get a hello in the elevator,'' he said. In fact, in an elevator once, making what he considered neighborly conversation, someone told him that he ''overshares.''\nWhen he arrived at 419 East 140th Street, he found a three-story brick town house built in 1897, with three fireplaces, a solid staircase, appealing woodwork, a pretty little garden in front and a yard in the back. It was structurally sound, with obvious but fixable flaws. All of the wood floors were covered with linoleum that seemed to have been applied with glue of steel, and the walls were obscured with plastic paneling.The ceilings had been lowered and surfaced with Styrofoam panels.\nLike most people who live in New York, however, he associated the South Bronx with devastation, with gangs and knifings and burned-out housing, even though that image had nothing to do with what he was seeing. So he went to the local police station and asked, ''If I were your uncle, would you tell me to live in this neighborhood?'' They gave him mixed advice. ''One said it's a good block,'' he recalled. ''Another said, 'Don't do it.' ''\nHe chose to believe in the believers.\nMr. Oglesby bought the house for $113,000, which was $6,000 less than the asking price. He had retired from the United Nations at the beginning of 1997 when he was 58, but was able to get a mortgage from the credit agency there, and when the house was appraised it was valued at $140,000. The taxes are only $595 a year. It is a landmarked block, and some of the houses, he said, are very elaborate, with marble floors and lavish moldings.\nHe closed in July, and since then has been working with friends, many of them from Indonesia, to renovate the building. He has also hired an Indonesian contractor who is putting in a new kitchen on the ground floor.\nOn the main floor, he has exposed gracious 12-foot ceilings. The center room, once a bathroom, will be his library, and is now being supplemented with books about the Bronx.\nIn the living room, he ripped out a closet and discovered a graceful arched opening that makes the perfect backdrop for his carved day bed from Thailand. Like all of the furniture collected during his years in Asia, it can go into a small van, because it is made from panels. ''These pieces were built before nails,'' he said.\nON the top floor, he has turned the front room into his bedroom, furnishing it with a grand four-poster bed that looks as though it must have come from his travels, but turns out to have been recently bought on sale at Macy's. He has also stripped the paint from oak woodwork around the windows in the bedroom.\nThe back room, a guest bedroom, has, like the main bedroom, large closets. There is so much space he literally doesn't know what to do with it. Asked what he will do with the front room, opposite the living room, he said: ''I don't know. Help me decide.''\nNot counting the value of his own labor, or the contributions of his friends, he figures it will cost about $15,000 to renovate the house. He will try to fix the outside, which is cracking and crumbling, with a grant from the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, which gives up to $15,000 per homeowner to help people of modest means preserve landmarked buildings.\nAlthough he sometimes lectures on Asian culture and international relations as an adjunct professor at places like Fordham and New York University, his retirement is giving him time to take singing lessons and prepare for a cabaret performance.\nWhen he's out at night, he never takes a cab because he knows too many people who have been in accidents. Instead he takes a bus that lets him off half a block away or the subway. Even at night, he says, ''it's not a menacing place.S\nAnd it is quiet. He found the Upper West Side very noisy, filled with trucks. In Mott Haven, he hears church bells on Sunday, and an occasional rooster. But his friends from Manhattan are dubious. ''The South Bronx is the kiss of death to them,'' he said. ''The area still has a horrible stigma.''\nHe has quickly become a part of the neighborhood, getting to know its quirks, like its profusion of stores selling beepers. Around the corner, he can buy a good cup of coffee for less than a dollar.\n''There's everything you want,'' he said, ''but no tonic water, no New York Times.'' He has met a lot of people, like the couple down the street who have lived there for 50 years, and his neighbor, who the other day showed him pictures of her grandchildren.\nWhen he dropped off some old clothes at the church up the street, the pastor reciprocated by giving him a funky lamp with pink and green glass, which now shares a room with his lacquered chest from Burma and clay jars from Indonesia. The beat policeman who is legendary for his good relations with the residents of Mott Haven stopped by to introduce himself and spent a half hour touring the house.\nWhen he walks around the neighborhood with a visitor, showing off the antique shops on Bruckner Boulevard, the new houses selling for $300,000, and the recently sandblasted facades, people know him and say hello.\n''In this neighborhood,'' he said, ''oversharing is a virtue.''","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"1fa3bae8-f27a-4cc8-a9b9-bbf636a5981c","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T06:46:53.961+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"245234d8-cf2a-4145-a695-833c417e9fa2","content":"NEW YORKERS & CO.; Indian-Italian Eating At Modest Prices\n1998-03-29T05:00:00.000Z\nAlthough Indian-Continental fusion cuisine is now popular, not all of it is expensive.

But while the air drops may fill a few stomachs, they damage the effectiveness of humanitarian aidin this and other conflicts.\nThe Western coalition is trying to prove to Afghans and the wider world that this is not a war against the Afghan people, that on the contrary it wants to help them.\nBut limited food drops are a symbolic gesture. It is extremely unlikely that these few items of assistance reach the poorest and most vulnerable Afghans. The experience of Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) in delivering humanitarian aid throughout the world in armed conflicts for more than 30 years has taught that untargeted and unmonitored relief, particularly food aid, rarely reaches those who need it most.\nThe food drops are a superficial and misleading gesture. Decisions on humanitarian intervention should be based on needs alone, independent of military or political objectives. Otherwise those Afghans in greatest need of food and medical assistance will go without.\nIf the military is involved in delivering humanitarian assistance, the aid can be regarded by opponents asan act of war. If humanitarian action is seen as partisan, aid and aid workers can be denied access to people in need. In Pakistan, some United Nations offices, theoretically a beacon of hope for war-distressed people, have been looted and burned.\nAid agencies have left Afghanistan for fear of being targeted because they are identified with the coalition. Security fears have forced aid agenciesin Kashmir, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kenya and Somalia to reduce work, depriving many people of badly needed assistance.\nHumanitarian aid promotes a concern for humanity and dignity in times of violence. Such aid relies on respect for the impartiality of aid agencies. MSF in Somalia is still paying the price a decade later for the confusion between military and humanitarian objectives.Confusion was created again during the Kosovo crisis by the presence of NATO troops in refugee camps; the camps were shelled by Yugoslav forces. When the bombing stops and humanitarian agencies can move into Afghanistan, how will the warring parties tell them apart from humanitarian bombers?\nThe military can provide help to people in danger in certain circumstances. Logistical resources are frequently deployed to respond to natural disasters, and peacekeepers have animportant role to play in protecting civilians caught in conflict. But every time a military belligerently involved in a conflict describes its actions as humanitarian, this vital concept is eroded.\nAid agencies are perceived as less neutral and less independent; staff will find it increasingly difficult to work and will be increasingly targeted.\nThe people of Afghanistan are in desperate need and have almost no assistance. Millions face starvation. The United Nations has drastically reduced operations; all but a few aid workers have withdrawn from Afghanistan and now wait across the border. On one side tons of aid and hundredsof staff; on the other side millions of people suffering.\nA large-scale, independent humanitarian relief effort aimed directly at reaching those most in need is required. This response could be led by the United Nations, with a clearly understood humanitarian mandate, in collaboration with independent relief agencies. All parties to the conflict must allow passage of large convoys bearing food, medicine and humanitarian workers who can ensure that the aid is delivered to those who need it.\nIf the coalition really wants to save the most desperate people, it should concentrate effort and resources on making this happen, rather than on symbolic air drops. The Taliban and their allies have the same responsibility toward civilians in war.\n-\nDr. Rostrup is the international president of Médecins Sans Frontières.

In that one camp alone, more than 175 refugees, most of them children, have died in the past two months.\nGETTING BACK TO WORK, SLOWLY -- As the focus in northern Afghanistan shifted from fighting to relief, aid agencies, many of whose offices had been badly looted in recent weeks, began to get back to work and distribute supplies that can now be brought in over the border from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In the Afghan capital, Kabul, there were also signs of life beginning anew.\nSeveral dozen Marines secured the American Embassy compound where, just last September a Taliban protester had clambered up the front of the building and tried to remove the United States seal. The seal is still there, but the embassy, closed since 1989, is in a sorry state, badly in need of new paint.\nBritain is ready to take the lead in an international security force that could deploy as many as 5,000 soldiers in and around Kabul as a provisional government takes charge on Dec. 22. France and Germany have also agreed to contribute troops, and forces may also come from Muslim nations like Turkey, Jordan, Bangladesh and Indonesia.\nThough the United States has troops on the ground in Afghanistan helping to round up Taliban leaders and Al Qaeda terrorists, the Pentagon does not plan to contribute any soldiers to a peacekeeping force.\nOn a stop in Germany yesterday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell made it clear that the international force will be quite distinct from the American military presence. ''The two are very, very different forces,'' he said.\nHUNTING FOR BIN LADEN, WITH BOMBS -- In Washington, senior officials confirmed what most people in Afghanistan already know: the Taliban is finished. But, the Pentagon hastened to add, the war is far from over.\nIn eastern Afghanistan, the hunt for Osama bin Laden was still on, even as American planes continue to bomb the caves and tunnels of the Tora Bora mountains.\nFor the third time in this war, the United States dropped a ''daisy cutter'' bomb on Sunday against a mountain face in Tora Bora. The 15,000-bomb, one Pentagon official said, was dropped on a cave that would now be impossible to enter or leave.\nThe deputy defense secretary, Paul D. Wolfowitz, said the bombing raids had disrupted Al Qaeda's ability to communicate and had diminished Mr. bin Laden's authority. ''This is a man on the run, a man with a big price on his head,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said. ''He doesn't have any good options.''\nSo far, opposition forces have captured three Taliban leaders, including the former chief of staff, who is being held in northern Afghanistan by a local commander, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum.\nFrom their base southwest of Kandahar, United States marines moved in closer to the city to seal escape routes for Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's spiritual leader.\nROUNDING UP PRISONERS, GRIMLY -- There were new and gruesome details about the fate of some of the thousands of Taliban soldiers who were taken prisoner by the Northern Alliance earlier in the war.\nAccording to eyewitnesses, dozens of Taliban prisoners, including many foreign fighters, suffocated as they were transported in shipping containers from Kunduz to a prison in Sheberghan, the hometown of General Dostum.\nThe great numbers of prisoners posed a logistical problem for the Northern Alliance, which at the time was still facing pockets of Taliban resistance and fighting to put down a prison uprising in the Qala Jangi fortress outside Mazar-i-Sharif.\nOne of the prisoners in the Qala Jangi fortress-jail was John Walker Lindh, a young Californian who had joined the Taliban as a fervent convert to Islam.\nHe was one of the last men to see Johnny Spann alive. Mr. Spann, an officer of the Central Intelligence Agency who was killed during the prison uprising, was buried yesterday with full honors at Arlington National Cemetery, even as Mr. Walker was being interrogated by the United States military. He awaits a decision on whether he should be tried as traitor or as a criminal.

However, local television stations said it had already passed 3,000, and there were fears it could be much higher.\nThe Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross, warned that the toll could hit 10,000 once rescuers reach outlying islands, citing estimates from volunteers in rescue operations.\nGrieving survivors had grim tales about losing loved ones during the night of the disaster. In Galachipa, a fishing village along the coast in Patuakhali district, Dhalan Mridha and his family ignored the high cyclone alert issued by the authorities through radio and the Red Crescent volunteers.\nWhen Mridha realized his mistake, it was too late. \"Just before midnight the winds came like hundreds of demons. Our small hut was swept away like a piece of paper and we all ran for shelter,\" said Mridha, a 45-year-old farm worker, weeping. Mridha was separated from his wife, mother and two children while on his way to the shelter, a two-story building several blocks from his home. The next morning he found their bodies stuck in a battered bush along the coast.\nOn Sunday, hungry survivors scrambled for food as rescue workers cleared fallen trees and twisted roofs from roads to reach remote villages in a relief effort in which global aid groups have teamed up with the Bangladesh Army. Relief items like tents, rice and water have been slow to reach many.\nGovernment officials defended the relief efforts so far, and expressed confidence that the authorities were up to the task. \"We have enough food and water,\" said Shahidul Islam, the top official in Bagerhat, a battered district near the town of Barguna. \"We are going to overcome the problem.\"\nThe disaster management secretary, Aiyub Bhuiyan, met with representatives from the United Nations and international aid groups Sunday to discuss the emergency response.\nThe UN secretary general, Ban Ki Moon, said in a statement that several million dollars were available from the UN's emergency response funds, depending on the need.\nHe expressed his \"profound condolences to the people and government of Bangladesh for the many deaths and the destruction involved, and the full solidarity of the UN system at this time of crisis,\" the statement said.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[{"tagged_token_id":"63f77455-5add-4ea7-b0ce-06ac69449012","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"2e79bb70-e17f-4724-9d8d-4bf47ca53fe4","start":821,"end":880,"tag":"fatalities","tag_id":"69f4e5af-f7a5-4631-aaf4-2f4704e347d5","value":" local television stations said it had already passed 3,000","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T07:28:04.216+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"00af16d2-e6bc-4f5d-9d5c-4df37768972d","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"2e79bb70-e17f-4724-9d8d-4bf47ca53fe4","start":47,"end":57,"tag":"end date context","tag_id":"88cf8c2b-74e5-4ceb-8d00-3c3b56f4dacb","value":"2007-11-19","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T07:31:27.256+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"dbed0ba5-5e6e-4fc2-8280-526273b74af9","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"2e79bb70-e17f-4724-9d8d-4bf47ca53fe4","start":695,"end":754,"tag":"fatalities","tag_id":"69f4e5af-f7a5-4631-aaf4-2f4704e347d5","value":"The official death toll from the Cyclone Sidr reached 2,408","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T07:27:30.241+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"a023ed80-095d-4b23-9d74-79241b0f9060","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"2e79bb70-e17f-4724-9d8d-4bf47ca53fe4","start":995,"end":1043,"tag":"fatalities","tag_id":"69f4e5af-f7a5-4631-aaf4-2f4704e347d5","value":"Red Cross, warned that the toll could hit 10,000","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T07:28:34.776+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}],"classifications":[]},{"example_id":"303d1ad5-72a5-4e86-9f6f-ea2722e4bc8c","content":"Food Stuff\n1998-01-21T05:00:00.000Z\nFrench Fries The Belgian Way\nLet Burger King and McDonald's have at each other over their fries. Far better than either of these -- and taking their place among the best in the city, including those at Balthazar in SoHo -- are the fries at Le Frite Kot, 148 West Fourth Street (Avenue of the Americas). The name is Flemish, meaning ''cottage for fries,'' said Sham Sul Miah, above, the owner of this tiny, homey storefront. Mr. Miah, who was born in Bangladesh, lived in Brussels for 15 years, where he owned a restaurant, and until recently, he worked at Le Pain Quotidien on the Upper East Side, a Belgian bakery he helped open.\nLike the much-ballyhooed Pommes Frites on Second Avenue in the East Village, Mr. Miah twice-fries his potatoes and sells them in paper cones. Unlike fast-food fries, they are fresh. Eat them while they're hot; they don't travel well.\nA dozen toppings are offered for those who feel the need to embellish the fries. They include six based on mustard, a tomatoey Andalouse mayonnaise, aioli and American ketchup, along with plain mayon naise, the way the Belgians eat them. The prices: small, $2.25; medium, $3.25, and large, $4.25. There are tables in a rather barren room upstairs, which Mr. Miah plans to turn into a more inviting cafe.\nRazor Clams to Steam\nAmong the most intriguing shellfish are razor clams with narrow rectangular shells that look exactly like straight razors. Beachcombers can find the shells -- they fascinate children -- but the clams themselves are much more elusive. Citarella is a much better source than most beaches. The stores, at 2135 Broadway (75th Street) and 1313 Third Avenue (75th Street), have been getting them from Maine, $4.95 a pound. There are about a dozen per pound.\n''We're in competition with the Japanese because they tend to buy them up, but we've had them pretty regularly for the past number of weeks,'' said Joe Gurrera, the owner.\nLike steamers, razor clams have soft shells that never close completely. The ones from the East Coast are smaller and more delicate than West Coast razor clams, which have much larger, almost oval shells.\nEastern razor clams are excellent steamed. In Venice, where a similar variety is also found, they are highly prized, usually brushed with butter and broiled on the half-shell.\nChipotle Pretzel Nuggets\nSuper Bowl Sunday is super-snack Sunday. And among the most addictive snack items to come along recently are the chipotle pretzel nuggets from Chile Today-Hot Tamale, a mail-order company. They combine a pleasant degree of heat with a touch of smoke and heavy-duty crunch.\nThe company sells a four-pound tin for $19.95 and, for an extra charge, can ship it overnight, in plenty of time for the game. To order: (800) 468-7377.\nThe pretzels are also sold in 12-ounce bags for $2.99 at Fairway, 2127 Broadway (74th Street) and 2328 12th Avenue (132d Street), and at Gourmet Garage, 453 Broome Street (Mercer Street), 301 East 64th Street and 2567 Broadway (96th Street).\nFive Stars From Mobil\nThis year the Mobil Travel Guides added only one restaurant, the Grill Room in the Windsor Court Hotel in New Orleans, to their list of 15 that have been awarded five stars, the highest rating.\nFour restaurants in Manhattan have maintained their five-star ratings: Chanterelle, Daniel, Les Celebrites and Lespinasse.\nThe list of 25 five-star hotels includes two new ones: the Point, a resort on Upper Saranac Lake, in the Adirondacks, and the Breakers in Palm Beach, Fla.\nIn order to be rated, a restaurant or hotel must be in business for at least a year.\nThe 1998 Mobil guide to four- and five-star restaurants and hotels is titled America's Best Hotels and Restaurants and is published by Fodor's. The book, one of a number of national and regional restaurant and hotel guides in the Mobil series, is available at bookstores for $11.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"303d1ad5-72a5-4e86-9f6f-ea2722e4bc8c","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T07:41:17.984+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"37200ebc-8772-4d43-ae64-a5dbf2feb1fb","content":"Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor, Your Vote\n2001-04-08T05:00:00.000Z\nYdanis Rodriguez, a schoolteacher and candidate for City Council, went campaigning the other day in Washington Heights, home to New York City's biggest concentration of Dominican immigrants like him. Buffeted by wet gusts of wind, he called out greetings in Spanish and was rewarded with broad smiles of recognition.\nBut being popular in a neighborhood buoyed by immigrants, while comforting on a cold day, will not necessarily get an immigrant politician elected. As Mr. Rodriguez would be the first to admit, few of those who greeted him so cheerfully may be eligible to vote.\n''We have a long way to go,'' he acknowledged. ''To empower our community, it's not just a question of getting elected but of educating people so they understand they have to become citizens and to register.''\nStill, this could be a banner year for politicians like Mr. Rodriguez.\nHe is one of at least a dozen foreign-born candidates who have set their sights on the City Council elections this fall, when term limits will force out two-thirds of the incumbents and 35 seats will be open.\nMany more of the 175 people who have declared their intentions to run are second-generation immigrants with Hispanic, Asian or West Indian roots.\nIn fact, so many immigrant candidates are chasing the immigrant vote that they could cancel one another out in some races. For example, along with Mr. Rodriguez, at least five others of Dominican descent are running for the Council seat in Upper Manhattan held by another Dominican-American, Guillermo Linares.\nIt is inevitable: a wave of immigration has transformed New York City since the mid-1970's. One million legal immigrants arrived in just the last decade and by now, city planners estimate, about 40 percent of New Yorkers are foreign born.\nDespite their numerical strength, the newcomers from Asia, Latin America and the former Soviet Union have yet to win real political power. Their biggest handicap is that not all of them become citizens. And their American-born children, when they are old enough, tend to vote at the same rate as other Americans -- infrequently. But recen years have brought significant changes that could give these New York residents their best shot at shaking up local elections.\nSpurred by national laws that eliminated services for even legal immigrants, a record number of them, nearly 575,000, have become citizens since 1996. Concerted voter registration efforts by advocates like the New York Immigration Coalition also appear to have paid off. The number of registered voters in he city has topped 3.6 million, 278,000 higher than a year ago.\nAt the same time, term limits have removed the advantage of incumbency in Council races, opening opportunities for Hispanic, Asian and other immigrant candidates who had largely been ignored by established party organizations. Finally, a generous campaign finance law will give even neophytes access to public matching funds to run promotional ads and print campaign material.\n''This is a situation where you have had just a little bit of change in any one year, but when you add up 10 years, it can be substantial,'' said John Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the graduate center of the City University of New York.\nHe added: ''The non-Hispanic white population is down, the immigrant population is up and there really was a lot more naturalization in the second half of the 90's. Gradually that's going to translate into greater voter registration and, sooner or later, into more votes.''\nA study by Dr. Mollenkopf of where new voters registered from 1994 through 1999 showed the biggest increases in areas that have received the greatest number of immirants. That is not so surprising. But what has happened in other neighborhoods could tip the balance in a city where voting often divides along ethnic and racial loyalties. In some non-Hispanic white neighborhoods, voter rolls actually srank.\nCandidates who try to mine the immigrant vote still face their own peculiar challenges; for instance, there is the task of focusing energy on people who can actually cast a vote on Election Day, and then getting those people to the polls. That is the kind of help that has historically been provided by the Democratic Party organization. While its power to deliver jobs and favors has declined sharply, some neighborhood clubs and county organizations still anoint their favorites and mobilize on behalf of selected candidates.\nBut few immigrant activists have advanced very far in the party hierarchy.\n''I am the only Hispanic who is a Democratic leader of any county in the state, so I am qualified to say that the Democratic Party has failed miserably to take into account this new constituency,'' said Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic Party chairman.\nMr. Ramirez, who was born in Puerto Rico, said the party structure was uncomfortable with ''the sleeping giant'' that Hispanic and other immigrant voters represent.\n''New immigrants have a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed approach to voting,'' he said. ''The problem is that the political apparatus over the years has become less eager to take advantage of them because these people look different.''\nIndeed, to many would-be immigrant politicians, the party is often seen as more of a hindrance than a help.\n''As long as you're an activist, you're welcome,'' said Inna Stavitsky, a Russian-born candidate running for the Council seat in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. ''As soon as you're a candidate, you're not, of course, because you're a rival.''\nThe enduring power of the clubs shows on Election Day. Poll workers and observers are drawn from the ranks of established party networks.\n''All sides are controlled by the clubs and for new people it's very difficult to participate,'' said Ms. Stavitsky, echoing complaints that have been raised by many Asian-American and Hispanic groups. ''Last year there was a lot of abuse. In many cases they are very old. They have hearing impediments. And they don't understand the differences between the first and last names of immigrants.''\nLabor unions, on the other hand, have shown more interest in promoting immigrant candidates.\n''They do pretty systematic phone banks,'' said Rocky Chin, a City Council candidate in Lower Manhattan who has already been endorsed by Unite, the garment workers' union. Mr. Chin is a Chinese-American seeking the seat held by Kathryn E. Freed.\n''And the unions do a better job of addressing the issue of building coalitions between minority groups,'' Mr. Chin added, ''because they have all these different groups.''\nIn some elections, though, like last year's, accumulating immigrant votes takes more than an organizational structure.\nIn parts of Queens, the Chinese-language ballots in November reversed the party headings for Congressional, state and judicial candidates, so that the Democrats were listed under the heading of Republican and Republicans under the heading of Democrat. Board of Elections officials blamed a printing error and said it would not be repeated.\nSometimes the confusion is at least partly self-generated. One example was the primary election in Brighton Beach, home to a majority of the elderly Russian-American immigrants who have flooded New York in the past decade.\nDozens of voters complained that they were not permitted to write in the name of a Russian-American candidate they favored for a State Assembly seat, but whose name was not on the ballot. Shoving matches and shouting also broke out at some polling stations when would-be voters did not find their names on the rolls.\nThe chaos was typical of many election districts with large numbers of new citizens and elderly voters who do not understand that they must register by party to vote in a party primary. In the case of many Russian-Americans, who had experience in the fraudulent elections of their homeland, being turned away is evidence of a dark conspiracy.\nThe final challenge to immigrant voting strength also comes from within. They are so diverse that their impact on the power structure is fractured.\nOutside of a few areas like Washington Heights, where most of the Hispanic residents are believed to be from the Dominican Republic, immigrants do not live in sizable enclaves that approach the critical mass of a single voting bloc.\nIn Flushing, Queens, for example, Asians make up 52 percent of the population. Several Asian-American candidates, including three who have unsuccessfully run for office before, are hoping to capitalize on the changing demographics. They are running for the City Council seat held by Julia Harrison.\nBut while Asians may be in the majority, they are not all from the same place. Aside from its large Chinese population, Flushing has also attracted substantial numbers of Koreans, Indians, Bangladeshis and Pakistanis who may have no particular incentive to vote for someone of a different national origin.\nAnd that is where candidates have to walk a thin line. On one hand, they try to appeal to immigrant voters as a fellow Chinese-American, Dominican-American or Russian-American. On the other, they may not get elected unless they have crossover appeal.\n''We have to mobilize around issues and interests,'' said Margaret Chin, a candidate for the City Council seat in Lower Manhattan, which includes neighborhoods like Chinatown, SoHo and the Lower East Side.\nFor her and other candidates in the district, the controversy over the closing of the Grand Street subway station has been fortuitous. It has galvanized the traditionally disengaged residents of Chinatown. It may even convince them of the importance of having a friend at City Hall.\nCandidates like Ms. Chin can only hope.\n''Ten years ago, you couldn't mobilize to this extent,'' she said. ''But little by little, I think, people will realize that voting is important.''","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"37200ebc-8772-4d43-ae64-a5dbf2feb1fb","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T07:42:39.183+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"3976902c-675e-4c97-a80e-425f9d1b8c58","content":"Water woes plague Bangladesh village hit by cyclone\n2007-11-21T05:00:00.000Z\nKANAINAGAR, Bangladesh — To the naked eye, it looks like Cyclone Sidr barely grazed this village. Most of the houses are standing. No one has died. The trees are not even decapitated, as they are in so many hamlets swallowed by the storm.\nBut in this part of the world, where life revolves around water, look more closely and see how the storm has fouled so much of everyday life. Paddy fields are waterlogged. Shrimp ponds are full of rotting debris. Women worry about what their children will drink once their pots of rainwater run out. Not enough water, too much water, dirty water. Water bedevils everyone.\nAid was trickling across the cyclone zone Wednesday, nearly a week after the disaster, also reaching this village, where a long line of supplicants were given sacks of rice, lentils and salt.\nThe country's neighbors - allies and rivals - seemed to fall over themselves to offer charity and succor. Pakistan, the country's former ruler, against whom Bangladesh fought a bitter war of independence in 1971, announced that it would send two military planes with medical supplies and blankets. India, for its part, said an air force cargo plane would arrive Thursday with 38 tons of relief materials.\nTwo U.S. Navy vessels were on their way and were expected to reach the area with helicopters as early as the end of the week. Saudi Arabia pledged $100 million earlier this week, the largest of all, until the World Bank on Wednesday offered $250 million. Whether and how soon the pledged support will materialize is a mystery.\nNeither the government nor aid agencies yet had an estimate on how much money was needed to meet the humanitarian need, except for a World Food Program assessment that found that $30 million would be needed just for the next three months of food.\nThe UN resident representative for Bangladesh, Renata Lok Dessallien, said food, water and shelter were the immediate relief needs, which were all the more acute for cyclone victims who were already poor, likely to be malnourished and vulnerable to disease.\nCyclone Sidr has cut a wide and debilitating swath through southern Bangladesh. The government estimates 4 million people were affected, and the full scope of its impact may not be truly felt for many weeks to come. By the Bangladesh Army's latest count, 3,167 people have died.\nSunita Mondol, 15, was already feeling its toll. She stood at the side of her family's pond Wednesday morning and found no more than two tiny shrimp clinging to her net. On a normal morning, she would haul a full basket and take it to the market to sell. But the storm had spoiled the pond, shaking the leaves and branches off of the trees and polluting the water, so much so that the shrimp died and floated belly-up. On the first morning after the storm, she and her family pulled up 6 kilograms, or 13 pounds, of dead fish. Most of it was thrown away.\nFamilies like hers, who make their living from selling the fish and shrimp they cultivate in their ponds, expect to feel the economic pinch of the cyclone for months to come. Every family in this village has a small pond. House after house complained that their ponds had been fouled.\nIn Pinjira Begum's two big ponds, she estimated that half her fish were floating belly-up, which meant that her daily earnings plummeted by nearly half. The moneylender came to her home last Saturday to collect his weekly payment.\n\"We told him we didn't have money to buy rice for the children,\" she said. She gave him half of what she owed. He cursed her and left, she said.\nSouthern Bangladesh is one of the world's most productive shrimp production areas, and shrimp is one of the country's largest exports to the United States.\nThe lucky ones here had some rainwater left in their traditional earthen pots. Those whose water had run out, or whose pots were broken, had to drink the pond water, which had turned salty from sea water and began to stink because of putrefying leaves.\nA rickshaw puller down the road wondered aloud how long it would be until dysentery struck. Even without a cyclone, he said, water brings a constant specter of disease. In the hot months, when the rainwater stores run out and the ponds start drying up, the people of Kanainagar suffer skin rash, dysentery and diarrhea.\n\"Water is our main problem,\" said Alamgir Hossain. \"People get too sick to work and still they have to buy medicine.\"\nAcross the Mongla River, Mohammed Nantu Mian worked feverishly to salvage what the water had not wrecked. His paddy field was flooded, just two weeks before the harvest was due. He had managed to drain some of the water by cutting channels in his fields. He hired workers to cut what paddy had not yet rotted. He figured a third of his crop was gone.\nNormally, Mian said, he sold half of what he produced, saving the rest for his own family and for seed next year. This year, he said, he could hope to feed his family, and not much more.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[{"tagged_token_id":"6ef20101-cb39-4995-aa14-4a1e6f44cd35","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"3976902c-675e-4c97-a80e-425f9d1b8c58","start":475,"end":490,"tag":"Flood type","tag_id":"6de6f201-e6f3-46be-845f-21a8d8190680","value":"waterlogged.

Official Says\n2007-08-08T04:00:00.000Z\nNEW DELHI, Aug. 7 — As exceptionally heavy rains continued to cut a wide swath of ruin across northern India, a top United Nations official warned Tuesday that the vagaries of climate change could destroy vast swaths of farmland in this country, ultimately affecting food production and adding to the woes of already desperate peasants who live off of the land. \nEven a small increase in temperatures, said Jacques Diouf, director general of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, could push down crop yields in southern regions of the world, even as agricultural productivity goes up in northern climes like Europe. A greater frequency of droughts and floods, the agency added, could be particularly bad for agriculture.\n “Rain-fed agriculture in marginal areas in semiarid and subhumid regions is mostly at risk,” Mr. Diouf said on a visit to the southern Indian city of Chennai. “India could lose 125 million tons of its rain-fed cereal production, equivalent to 18 percent of its total production.”\nThat is a signal of the steep human and economic impact of extreme weather in India, where a majority of peasants still rely on the rains to irrigate their fields and where a bad flood can be nearly as devastating as a bad drought. The latest floods have affected an estimated 20 million people in India alone, 8 million in neighboring Bangladesh and 300,000 in Nepal, according to the United Nations children’s agency. \nThe World Meteorological Organization said in a statement on Tuesday that the region experienced double the normal number of monsoon depressions in the first half of the four-month rainy season that started in June, causing heavy rainfall and flooding across South Asia. \nNearly a third of India’s meteorological districts received higher-than-average rains, according to government figures. The latest tally released by the Home Ministry reads like an inventory of ruin: nearly 8,000 square miles of agricultural land inundated since the start of the monsoon two months ago, more than 130,000 houses destroyed, 1,428 people killed. \nGovernment relief teams have fanned out across northern Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh States, dropping relief packets by air. Even as the rains stopped over the last couple of days, stagnant water raised the risks of water-borne disease, from diarrhea to dengue fever, in areas that are already among the nation’s poorest and least healthy. There have been no reports of disease outbreaks yet. \nIndia stands to bear the brunt of some of the worst effects of climate change, in large measure because it is ill-prepared. When the rivers swell, fragile embankments burst. Mud and thatch houses easily crumble. When the water rises, as it does year after year to varying degrees, Indian peasants are ritually stranded. \n“These floods are a curse to us,” Ganesh Acharya, 40, said by telephone from a marooned part of Bihar State. “Our lives comes to a standstill.” In his village, he said, the rice crop had washed away, and people have had to paddle to a nearby village to buy basic goods, at far higher prices than normal.\nShiv Shankar Acharya, 58, a local college lecturer, said he did not recall when so much water had accumulated, and had refused to subside for more than 10 days.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[{"tagged_token_id":"d1659b27-0182-4205-b37e-ec8486047ede","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"42021e40-f3be-4b65-80dc-e1d000fedabc","start":1408,"end":1443,"tag":"people displaced","tag_id":"4d4b0aa8-16e5-4874-bd1e-24b9130c8835","value":"8 million in neighboring Bangladesh","correct":false,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T07:49:18.191+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"117ebbfd-e255-4070-81e6-55fb8e8d3995","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"42021e40-f3be-4b65-80dc-e1d000fedabc","start":101,"end":126,"tag":"Flood type","tag_id":"6de6f201-e6f3-46be-845f-21a8d8190680","value":"exceptionally heavy rains","correct":false,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T07:51:59.999+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"784ec332-db09-4beb-bd36-9f3cb7ae47a0","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"42021e40-f3be-4b65-80dc-e1d000fedabc","start":53,"end":63,"tag":"Start date context","tag_id":"d59b20b0-f04b-4098-8f91-1b1050cdb9bd","value":"2007-08-08","correct":false,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T07:52:37.615+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"42021e40-f3be-4b65-80dc-e1d000fedabc","classname":"Monsoon ","class_id":"a4fc0707-94d3-4ddb-8b3a-6dd4da2f2e84","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T07:52:25.201+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"427aaa4c-34a4-42e6-a50a-6f2e0405326b","content":"NEWS SUMMARY\n1998-09-09T05:00:00.000Z\nINTERNATIONAL A3-12\nU.S. Embassy in Kenya Was Seen as Easy Target\nThe American Embassy in Nairobi was apparently an easy target for terrorists.

The United Nations estimated that a million people had been left homeless, many of them in remote areas without predictable food supplies.\nThe Bangladesh Red Crescent Society warned Sunday that the number of dead could conceivably be 5,000 to 10,000, and the United Nations World Food Program said yesterday that it would not be surprised by such a tally. But yesterday the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said that reports from its officials who had been to the hardest-hit areas led the organization to expect a final toll in line with the government’s official assessment.\n“What we are seeing on the ground is not as horrifying,” said Devendra Tak, a senior regional spokesman for the federation, who spoke from Khulna, a town in southern Bangladesh, after visiting some of the districts that took the worst pounding from the cyclone, which had winds of more than 100 miles an hour. “We don’t see the level of destruction that we had feared earlier.” \nMr. Tak said thousands of fishermen who had been missing along the coastal areas and presumed dead had begun to turn up in their villages. “We are very optimistic that the overall disaster will not be on a very high level,” Mr. Tak said by telephone. \nThe United Nations said that it was waiting for a fuller picture to emerge and that the final death toll could still be significantly higher.

Says\n2007-08-07T04:00:00.000Z\nNEW DELHI, Aug. 7 — As exceptionally heavy rains continued to cut a wide swath of ruin across northern India, a top United Nations official warned today that climate change could destroy vast swaths of farmland in this country, ultimately affecting food production and adding to the woes of already desperate peasants who live off of the land. \nEven a small increase in temperatures, said Jacques Diouf, head of the Food and Agricultural Organization, could push down crop yields in the south around the world, even as agricultural productivity goes up in northern climes, including Europe. A greater frequency of droughts and floods, one of the hallmarks of climate change, the agency added, could be particularly bad for agriculture. “Rain-fed agriculture in marginal areas in semi-arid and sub-humid regions is mostly at risk,” Dr. Diouf explained. “India could lose 125 million tons of its rain-fed cereal production — equivalent to 18 percent of its total production.”\nThat is a sign of the steep human and economic impact of extreme weather in India, where a majority of peasants still rely on the rains to irrigate their fields. The monsoon can still make or break rural India’s fortunes, as last week’s floods have shown. An estimated 20 million people are affected in India alone, with another 8 million in neighboring Bangladesh and 300,000 in Nepal, according to the United Nations children’s agency. \nThe World Meteorological Organization also said in a statement today that the region experienced double the number of monsoon depressions in the first half of the four-month rainy season, causing heavy rainfall and flooding across South Asia. Nearly a third of India’s meteorological districts received higher-than-average rains, according to government figures released this week. \nThe Home Ministry’s tally read like an inventory of ruin. More than 2 million hectares of cropland had been affected by the floods this year, more than 130,000 houses destroyed, and 1,428 people killed. \nGovernment relief teams have fanned out across northern Assam, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh states, dropping relief packets by air. Even as the rains stopped over the last couple of days, stagnant water raised the risks of water-borne disease, from diarrhea to dengue fever, in areas that are already among the poorest and least healthy, though there were no reports of outbreaks today. \nIndia stands to bear the brunt of some of the worst effects of climate change, in large measure because it is ill-prepared. Embankments at river and sea are too fragile to withstand heavy flooding, while rural homes made of mud and thatch are vulnerable. When the water rises, as it does year after year, though to varying degrees, the poorest Indian peasants are virtually stranded.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"4387b773-6b1f-4f4f-aed8-aef65bd33981","classname":"Not a historic flood (eg. climate change)","class_id":"33eb7922-7c0c-4f3b-8cd7-b24282055058","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T07:58:47.079+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"4c1fcfe4-0ed2-4e09-b247-834b15adba8b","content":"WORLD BRIEFING\n2001-04-20T05:00:00.000Z\nAMERICAS\nCOLOMBIA: HOSTAGES FREED\nThirty-four Colombians working for Occidental Petroleum were freed by leftist rebels who had abducted them on Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said.

By midday today local time, the death toll of Cyclone Sidr, as it was called, stood at roughly 240, said an official reached by telephone at the control room of the Disaster Management ministry of Bangladesh.\nLong vulnerable to nature's fury, Bangladesh stands to suffer even more from extreme weather events like this as a result of human-induced climate change, scientists say. It was too early for government officials and independent relief workers to quantify the total scale of damage, though it was clear that by Bangladeshi standards, the impact would likely be relatively low.\nIn 1991, a tropical storm claimed roughly 140,000 lives. Bangladeshi relief agencies have since then developed early warning systems and storm shelters to help people evacuate before disaster strikes.\nThe Associated Press reported that 650,000 people had moved out of their homes.\nThe storm weakened by today. Still, it brought distress to some of the most vulnerable people on Earth.\nPreliminary reports from the fragile delta regions of the Bay of Bengal indicated that rivers had swelled so high that water punched through mud embankments and washed away paddy and vegetable fields, ruining the year's earnings for peasants who live off of those lands.\nIn one district, Shatkhira, according to local journalists, roughly 5,000 mud homes collapsed back into the ground. Local relief workers for Caritas, the Catholic relief agency, reported that an entire island in Barisal district was submerged under at least six feet of water and houses were blown away by winds.\nThe capital, Dhaka, though not directly in the path of the storm, felt its punch. Electricity towers were down, darkening the entire country for several hours overnight, and much of Dhaka remained without power for most of the day today, which also pinched the water supply.\nRelief and rehabilitation efforts are likely to be a crucial test for the army-backed caretaker government in charge of Bangladesh.\nThe Indian side of the Bay of Bengal delta was largely spared. Government officials there estimated that 100,000 people had left their homes in search of safety, and while some trees and roofs had been blown away on the deltaic islands known as the Sunderbans, no casualties were reported and people had already begun returning home.\nThe United Nations Development Program, in pressing world leaders to take immediate steps to address climate change, argues that the increased frequency of droughts, floods and storms stands to hit the world's poor hardest and exacerbate poverty in places like Bangladesh. The agency is due to come out with details in its annual Human Development Report later this month.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"5291e0f9-b2b8-4a12-9556-eefe185a8592","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T08:06:56.239+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"5933dd5b-36f1-4f3e-81cb-2cdf8ce77bc0","content":"Spared Cyclone’s Worst, Area Still Suffers\n2007-11-22T05:00:00.000Z\nKANAINAGAR, Bangladesh, Nov. 21 — To the naked eye, this looks like a village that Cyclone Sidr barely grazed. Most of the houses are standing. No one has died. The trees are not even decapitated, as they are in so many hamlets swallowed by the storm.\nBut in this part of the world, where life revolves around water, look more closely and see how the storm has fouled so much of everyday life. Rice fields are waterlogged. Shrimp ponds have rotted. Women worry what their children will drink once their pots of rainwater run out. Not enough water, too much water, dirty water. Water bedevils everyone.\nAid began to trickle in across the cyclone zone on Wednesday, nearly a week after the storm. In this village, a long line of supplicants received sacks of rice, lentils and salt, and the country’s neighbors, allies and rivals seemed to fall over themselves to offer charity and succor.\n Pakistan, the country’s former ruler, which Bangladesh fought a bitter war of independence against in 1971, announced that it would send two military planes full of medical supplies and blankets. India said that an air force cargo plane would arrive Thursday with 38 tons of aid.\nTwo United States Navy vessels were en route and expected to arrive with helicopters within days. Saudi Arabia pledged $100 million early this week, the largest amount, until the World Bank offered $250 million on Wednesday. Whether and how soon the pledged support will materialize is a mystery.\nNeither the government nor aid agencies had an estimate on how much money was necessary to meet the humanitarian need, but a World Food Program assessment found that $30 million would be required for food just for the next three months. The United Nations resident representative for Bangladesh, Renata Lok Dessalien, said food, water and shelter were the immediate needs, and were all the more acute for cyclone victims who were already poor, likely to be malnourished and vulnerable to disease.\nCyclone Sidr cut a wide and debilitating swath through southern Bangladesh. The government estimates that four million people have been affected, and the full scope of its impact may not be felt for many weeks. By the Bangladeshi Army’s latest count, 3,167 people have died.\nIn Kanainagar, near Dhaka, the capital, Sunita Mondol, 15, was feeling the cyclone’s toll. She stood at the side of her family’s pond Wednesday morning and found no more than two tiny shrimps clinging to her net. On a normal morning, she would haul in a full basket and take it to the market to sell. \nBut the storm had spoiled the pond, shaking the leaves and branches from the trees and fouling the water, so much that the shrimps died and floated belly up. On the first morning after the storm, Sunita and her family pulled up more than 13 pounds of dead fish. They threw most away.\nFamilies like hers, who make their living from selling the fish and shrimps they cultivate in their ponds, expect to feel the economic pinch of the cyclone for months. Every family in this village has a small pond, and family after family complained of theirs having been fouled.\nHalf of the fish in Pinjira Begum’s two big ponds floated belly up, which meant that her daily earnings plummeted by nearly half. The moneylender came to her home last Saturday for his weekly payment. “We told him we didn’t have money to buy rice for the children,” she said. She gave him half of what she owed. He cursed her and left.\nSouthern Bangladesh is one of the world’s most productive shrimp hubs. Shrimp is one of the country’s largest exports to the United States.\nThe lucky ones here had rainwater left in their traditional earthen pots. Those whose water had run out, or whose pots had broken, had to drink the pond water, which had turned salty from seawater and had begun to stink from putrefying leaves.\nA rickshaw puller down the road wondered aloud how long it would be until dysentery struck. Even without a cyclone, he said, water brings a constant specter of disease. \nIn the hot months, when the rainwater stores run out and the ponds start drying up, the people of Kanainagar suffer rashes, dysentery and diarrhea. The cyclone made a chronic concern potentially acute. \n“Water is our main problem,” said Alamgir Hossain. “People get too sick to work, and still they have to buy medicine.”\nAcross the Mongla River, Muhammad Nantu Mian worked feverishly to salvage what the water had not wrecked. His rice field was flooded, just two weeks before the harvest was due. The stalks were blown down like scarecrows by the brute wind. He had drained some of the water by cutting channels in his fields. He hired workers to cut what rice stalks had not yet rotted. He figured a third of his crop was gone.\nNormally, Mr. Mian said, he sold half of what he produced, saving the rest for his own family and for next year’s seeds. This year, he said, he could reasonably hope to be able to feed his family, and not much more.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"5933dd5b-36f1-4f3e-81cb-2cdf8ce77bc0","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T08:07:34.655+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"5c464f5d-318f-4aae-a843-22c83cf8d05d","content":"Look Again:Islam and Economic Development Go Together\n2001-10-02T05:00:00.000Z\nSept. 11 has spawned much theorizing about Islam and modernity. The theorizing may add to Muslim paranoia.\nOne notion now doing the rounds is that there is a clear connection between Islam and lack of economic development. This is then \"proved\" by references to the likes of Algeria and Syria, or by comparing Egypt with South Korea. It is time to look at the actual records and policies of the major Muslim countries — only one of the top six of which is Arab — and compare them with their non-Muslim peers.\nThe record of mostly Buddhist Korea has been remarkable by any standard. It underlines the fact that the only countries (city-states excepted) anywhere which have proved the equal of North America and Western Europe in economic development and technological change have been Japan and two places it colonized, Korea and Taiwan.\nEgypt's record has been on a par with poor Asian performers like Catholic Philippines but way ahead of Buddhist failures such as Burma and Cambodia. Egypt's mediocre record owes much not to Islam but to two decades of the socialist, secular nationalism of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, like Ne Win in Burma nationalizing industries and pushing out dynamic ethnic minorities.\nWestern commentators have been eager to contrast Muslim Pakistan's poor economic record compared with India. In fact, for the first 30 years of independence Pakistan did better. Its subsequent failings were owed partly to the nationalizations, carried out for domestic political as well as ideological reasons, by that most secular of its leaders, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\nOther failings can be attributed to the negative impact of 22 years of war in Afghanistan. Pakistan's abysmal record in educating women may owe something to Islam but more to its feudal social structure.\nHere Pakistan contrasts with the progress made in women's education in Iran, as much under the mullahs as under the shah. More women than men now enter Iran's universities.\nAt the political level, clerical oppression and international isolation remain problems, but the slowness of economic progress has been more due to state socialism. That was mostly the left's contribution to the anti-shah revolution and was further embedded by the war against Saddam Hussein.\nTehran again has an active stock market, and privatization is being held back by the political impasse rather than by Islamic ideology.\nPost-separation Pakistan has also fared poorly compared with Bangladesh – what was East Pakistan. Despite overcrowding and lack of resources, Bangladesh, the third most populous mainly Muslim state, has pulled itself up from its basket-case status to achieve food self-sufficiency. It has outdone India in terms of progress on education and family planning and maintains a rough and ready form of democracy.\nBangladesh has a secular system without being aggressively secularist along Turkish lines. Muslim Turkey has failed to reach West European levels of economic and social development, but it has a better track record than most of its Christian neighbors in Southern and Eastern Europe. Its current economic failings and restraints on democracy owe little to Islam but a lot to the statism still practiced by the heirs of Ataturk.\nThe largest Muslim country, Indonesia, had until four years ago the best economic and social development track record of any large (100 million or more) developing nation. Even under President Suharto there was pluralism and a larger measure of personal freedom than now exists in China.\nIts current economic problems have the same causes – excessive capital flows and cronyism – that afflicted much of East Asia. Previous failings, notably the state capitalism practiced by both Presidents Sukarno and President Suharto, were copied from the likes of Brazil, where for a while it was very successful.\nIndonesia's Muslim neighbor Malaysia has had one of the world's most persistently impressive records of progress, at least equal to its Buddhist neighbor Thailand. Attribute this if you wish to natural resources, or to the 45 percent non-Muslim population, or to foreign capital. But it has taken place under the aegis of a modernizing Malay/Muslim polity.\nIn East Asia since postwar independence there is no very evident connection between dominant religion and economic and social progress. Ditto in South Asia.\nAs for the major Muslim countries as a group, and excluding oil-rich Saudi Arabia and the Gulf sultanates, their economic performance has been ahead of Russia's and Eastern Europe's and at least the equal of Latin America's, despite Latin America's cultural links with Europe and North America and abundance of natural resources.\nThere are plenty of horror stories, especially in an Arab world beset by feudalism and humiliations at Western and Israeli hands. But Asia has its non-Muslim horrors, too.\nPolitical and economic arrangements in the major Muslim countries have been the products of specific histories, of which religion is only one component. These countries are no more run by loudmouthed and megalomaniac mullahs than the United States is run by ranting Christian radio evangelists. But they just might be one day, if the West insists on demonizing Islamic states in general without looking at the facts.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"5c464f5d-318f-4aae-a843-22c83cf8d05d","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T08:07:49.265+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"5efce153-4c7e-4d48-8471-ccd931e7abf6","content":"Extreme weather: A global problem\n2007-08-07T05:00:00.000Z\nGENEVA — Much of the world has experienced record-breaking weather events this year, from flooding in Asia to heat waves in Europe and snowfall in South Africa, the United Nations weather agency said Tuesday.\nThe World Meteorological Organization said global land surface temperatures in January and April were the warmest since such data began to be recorded in 1880, at more than one degree Celsius higher than average for those months.\nThere have also been severe monsoon floods across South Asia; abnormally heavy rains in northern Europe, China, Sudan, Mozambique and Uruguay; extreme heat waves in southeastern Europe and Russia; and unusual snowfall in South Africa and South America this year, the meteorological agency said.\n\"The start of the year 2007 was a very active period in terms of extreme weather events,\" Omar Baddour of the agency's World Climate Program said in Geneva.\nWhile most scientists believe extreme weather events will be more frequent as heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions cause global temperatures to rise, Baddour said it was impossible to say with certainty what the second half of 2007 would bring. \"It is very difficult to make projections for the rest of the year,\" he said.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a UN group of hundreds of experts, has noted an increasing trend in extreme weather events over the past 50 years and said irregular patterns will probably intensify.\nSouth Asia's worst monsoon flooding in recent memory has affected 30 million people in India, Bangladesh and Nepal, destroying croplands, livestock and property and raising fears of new health crises in the densely populated region.\nHeavy rains also hit southern China in June, with nearly 14 million people affected by floods and landslides that killed 120 people, the World Meteorological Organization said.\nEngland and Wales this year had their wettest May and June since records began in 1766, resulting in extensive flooding and more than $6 billion in damage, as well as at least nine deaths. Germany swung from its driest April since country-wide observations started in 1901 to its wettest May on record. And torrential rains have followed weeks of severe drought in northern Bulgaria - officials said Tuesday that at least seven people have been killed in floods.\nMozambique suffered its worst floods in six years in February, followed by a tropical cyclone the same month. Flooding of the Nile River in June caused damage in Sudan.\nIn May, Uruguay had its worst flooding since 1959.\nIn June, the Arabian Sea had its first documented cyclone, which touched Oman and Iran.\nTemperatures also strayed from the expected this year. Records were broken in southeastern Europe in June and July, and in western and central Russia in May. In many European countries, April was the warmest ever recorded.\nArgentina and Chile saw unusually cold winter temperatures in July while South Africa had its first significant snowfall since 1981 in June.\nThe World Meteorological Organization and its 188 member states are working to set up an early warning system for extreme weather events. The agency also wants to improve monitoring of the impacts of climate change, particularly in poorer countries that are expected to bear the brunt of floods.\nAs exceptionally heavy rains continued to cut a wide swath of ruin across northern India, a top UN official warned Tuesday that climate change could destroy vast swaths of farmland in the country, ultimately affecting food production and adding to the problems of already desperate peasants, The New York Times reported from New Delhi.\nEven a small increase in temperatures, said Jacques Diouf, head of the Food and Agricultural Organization, could push down crop yields in the world's southern regions, even as agricultural productivity goes up in the north. A greater frequency of droughts and floods, one of the hallmarks of climate change, the agency added, could be particularly bad for agriculture.\n\"Rain-fed agriculture in marginal areas in semi-arid and sub-humid regions is mostly at risk,\" Diouf said. \"India could lose 125 million tons of its rain-fed cereal production - equivalent to 18 percent of its total production.\" That is a sign of the steep human and economic impact of extreme weather in India.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"5efce153-4c7e-4d48-8471-ccd931e7abf6","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T08:10:17.806+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"5f3184d5-5dab-4423-b2d8-a67481e30ceb","content":"A NATION CHALLENGED: WINDOWS ON THE WORLD; A Showpiece's Survivors Wonder What to Do Now\n2001-09-21T05:00:00.000Z\nDavid Emil, the president of the company that ran Windows on the World, the beloved restaurant at the World Trade Center, stood before a sea of faces -- busboys from Ecuador, dishwashers from Ghana, cooks from Bangladesh -- and offered them a smidgen of hope.\nSomeday, he said, not next year, but certainly in five years or six, he will open a new Windows on the World.\nThe 350 workers, almost all of them immigrants, applauded wildly. They are grasping for rays of hope after last week's disaster in which the restaurant's whole morning shift -- 79 workers -- disappeared with the towers' collapse and the jobs of the 350 employees not working that morning were wiped out.\n''Our company is uniquely badly affected,'' said Mr. Emil, whose 107th-floor restaurant, thanks to its fabulous views, was a magnet for tourists, for weddings and for romantic dinners in which engagement rings were given.\nWhile the law firms and financial companies that were in the twin towers are slowly transferring their operations to hotel suites or to sister offices in other cities, Mr. Emil cannot simply reopen his restaurant elsewhere in Manhattan. Its magic, its view, is not easily recaptured.\n''Our company is out of business right now,'' Mr. Emil said.\nMr. Emil and the union that represents the restaurant's workers face three unusually daunting challenges at once: comforting and providing financial assistance to the families of the 79 workers who are missing or dead, finding jobs for the 350 survivors and figuring out how to create a new Windows on the World.\nFor now, the 350 survivors, drained and depressed, seem at a loss about what to do with their lives. No longer will they spend their days baking salmon, mixing salads, pouring Champagne and waiting on tables.\n''I don't know how I'm going to send money to support my family,'' said Ramon Hidalgo, a 33-year-old cook from the Dominican Republic whose wife and three young children still live in Santo Domingo.\nThe restaurant, Mr. Hidalgo explained, was both a ladder of opportunity and a United Nations: workers came from two dozen countries, including Colombia, Cuba, Egypt, Haiti, the Ivory Coast, Pakistan, Poland and Yemen.\n''Everybody was family,'' Mr. Hidalgo said. ''Never do I hear someone say, 'I hate somebody.' ''\nJoseph Ameyaw, his eyes swollen from tears, is also trying to pick up the pieces. His wife, Sophia Addo, a 36-year-old from Ghana, has been missing since the attack. Like many of the workers, she was striving for higher things -- studying to be a nurse -- while making $345 a week working on the restaurant's housekeeping staff.\n''I cannot sleep,'' Mr. Ameyaw said. ''I cannot eat. I lost a responsible lady.'' Each month, Ms. Addo sent hundreds of dollars to Ghana to support her parents and her 10-year-old daughter.\nUnion officials could not promise much in the way of benefits. There would be $15,000 in life insurance, workers' compensation death benefits and money from the crime victims board to cover burial expenses. The survivors were urged to apply for unemployment insurance and were told their health insurance would run out in two months. ''In no way to diminish the suffering of everybody else,'' Mr. Emil said, ''the people in the food service industry were probably least financially prepared to deal with this tragedy.''\nHe is urging contributions to the Windows of Hope Family Relief Fund, c/o David Berdon & Company, 415 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017.\nMr. Emil and union officials have contacted other restaurants to urge them to hire the survivors. But with the city's hotel and restaurant industry now in a tailspin, many restaurants are laying off rather than hiring. Still, many restaurants are contributing to the new relief fund.\nFor many survivors, their biggest hope is to see Windows reborn.\n''We have to rebuild the World Trade Center and Windows on the World,'' said Asmat Ali, a cook from Bangladesh.

But no one saw it as a border. It was just a lumpy field of grass, uneven from the hooves of generations of cattle, and villagers crossed back and forth without even thinking about it.\nToday, no one can ignore the line.\nIn a construction project that will eventually reach across 3,300 kilometers, or 2,050 miles, hundreds of rivers and long stretches of forests and fields, India has been quietly sealing itself off from Bangladesh, its much poorer neighbor. Sections totaling about 2,500 kilometers have been built over the past seven years.\nIn Sujatpur, a poor farming village, the frontier is now defined by two rows of barbwire barriers three meters, or 10 feet, high, the posts studded with ugly spikes the size of a toddler's fingers. A smaller fence, and miles of barbed wire coils, fill the space in between. The expanse of steel, set into concrete, spills off toward the horizon in both directions.\n\"Before, it was like we were one country,\" said Mohammed Iqbal, a Bangladeshi farmer walking near the border on a windy afternoon. \"I used to go over there just to pass the time.\"\nAs he spoke, a cow wandered past, brass bells jangling around its neck. \"But now that's over,\" he said.\nIn the United States, the decision to fence 1,100 kilometers of the Mexican border triggered months of political debate ranging across issues from immigration policy to the environmental impact. When Israel announced it would build a 680-kilometer barrier around the West Bank, an international outcry erupted.\nBut there has been barely a ripple over India's far larger project, begun in earnest in 2000 amid growing fears in New Delhi about illegal immigration and cross-border terrorism.\nThe Bangladesh government made a few complaints - the fence felt like an insult, as if their country was a plague that needed to be quarantined - but soon gave up.\nIndia has become enamored with fences in recent years.\nFirst it started closing off much of its border with Pakistan, trying to stop incursions by Muslim extremists. Then it turned to its other Muslim neighbor, Bangladesh, and has been building the fence intermittently ever since.\nThere is no clear completion date for the $1.2 billion project, which when finished will nearly encircle Bangladesh, leaving open only its seacoast and its border of about 320 kilometers with Myanmar.\nIndia maintains that some Indian militant groups are based in Bangladesh, a charge the Bangladeshi government denies.\nBut the larger fear in New Delhi is that illegal immigrants will flood out of Bangladesh, one of the most crowded countries, with 150 million people and low-lying land that is prone to devastating floods and typhoons. Scientists also warn that rising sea levels from global warming could force millions of Bangladeshis from their homes.\nIndia already has millions of its own citizens living in desperate poverty, despite an economy growing at more than 8 percent annually. Its population is approaching 1.2 billion and what little is left of its once-vast wilderness is being chewed up rapidly.\nIt is nearly impossible to judge how many residents of India are actually Bangladeshi. Particularly among the poor, many people have no identification showing their nationality, and residents of the frontier region tend to be similar in language and ethnicity. But some experts estimate as many as 20 million Bangladeshis are in India illegally, most of them crammed into large cities or in shantytowns just over the border.\n\"You've got an increasing population with a shrinking land mass\" in Bangladesh, said Ajai Sahni, head of the New Delhi-based Institute for Conflict Management, who worries that the Indian government is not building the fence quickly enough. \"India has enough nightmares of its own without adding to them.\"\nIn villages like Sujatpur, India's fears have changed everything.\nIt began about a year ago, when Indian soldiers and construction workers arrived on their side of the border without warning and announced that the frontier was closed.\nUntil then, people from this village of thatch-roofed huts, not even 200 meters from India, crossed the border daily to graze cattle, see friends or - since this part of India is one of the few that remains heavily forested - cut firewood and bamboo. Indians came to shop in Bangladeshi markets.\nFor Bangladeshis, particularly, the open border was a lifeline. India's $730 per capita income looks pitifully low by the standards of the developed world, but it is a decent income to many in Bangladesh, where about 60 million people live on less than $1 a day.\nIn a place like Sujatpur, where most families live hand to mouth, the cheap Indian grazing land and extra income from harvesting bamboo were economic godsends.\n\"Look at this place, we are poor,\" said Iqbal, gesturing around him. \"Selling that wood earned us money that we needed.\"\nThe fence is being built on Indian soil, though, and there is nothing that can be done about it on this side.\n\"They're big and we're small and so they can do this to us,\" said Sulaiman, a Bangladeshi border guard with only one name. \"It's insulting.\"\nBut it is also easy to see why India is nervous.\nSujatpur may reflect a picturesque side of poverty, with its Technicolor-green fields and gentle-spoken farmers, but a glance at the border makes a stark statement.\nOn the Bangladesh side are huts and roads, rice paddies and cattle.

Climbing inflation was compounded by an unusually harsh monsoon, which destroyed food crops along the flood plains in July.\nThen, the Nov. 15 cyclone destroyed acres of rice paddy, ruined the shrimp farms that dot the southern coast, and, according to the World Food Program, left roughly 2.3 million people in need of urgent food aid.\nStorm relief is now the government's most pressing test, including averting famine and disease outbreaks, and ensuring that aid distribution is perceived to be fair and without corruption. The government estimates that six million people were affected by the storm.\n\"This is going to be the real defining challenge for them,\" Rehman Sobhan, the chairman of the Center for Policy Dialogue, an independent research group based in Dhaka, said of the administration. \"A huge effort is going to be required.\"\nBangladesh is among the world's poorest nations, with a Muslim-majority population of more than 140 million and nearly half of its youngest children suffering from malnutrition. Polls indicate that even before the cyclone, confidence in the caretaker government was declining.\nThe way the ordinary Bangladeshi is being pinched every day was on stark display the other day in a working-class quarter of Dhaka called Begunbari, a crowded warren of tenements amid the roar of factories that supply cheap clothes for sale abroad, including in the United States.\nAbdul Aziz, 63, a security guard who was buying vegetables at the local market, quietly confessed that even with three grown daughters working in the garment industry, his family was finding it harder to put enough food on the table. On this afternoon, he bought half as many winter beans as he had hoped to and one small head of cauliflower instead of two. Those purchases, along with the staple rice and lentils, would have to feed his family of seven. \"We will make do,\" he said. \"Everyone will have a little bit.\"\nA tailor who serves the neighborhood said his business had plummeted from about 50 orders a day to barely a couple. Few can afford new clothes when the basics — onions, oil, cauliflower — have become so much costlier.\nFiroza Begum, the wife of a civil servant, said the government had failed to curb food prices, even as she gave it credit for cracking down on graft.\n\"They have caught some corrupt people — we can see that,\" she said. \"But we also want them to reduce prices of our daily needs, so we can somehow manage our households.\"\nShe said that she had all but given up buying milk and meat for her family because they were too expensive.\nIn her neighborhood, Election Commission workers were going door to door this afternoon taking names and addresses so they could compile a fresh list of those eligible to vote. Fakhruddin Ahmed, the civilian leader of the country's military-backed caretaker administration, has promised national elections by the end of 2008.\nBut exactly how soon elections will take place and under what circumstances, remain mysteries, considering that several major politicians are in jail or in exile. The leaders of the two top political parties, Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and Sheik Hasina Wazed of the Awami League, are in custody on various graft and extortion charges. Whether they will be allowed to take part in the election is anyone's guess.\nUnder emergency rule, the press is prohibited from publishing anything deemed \"provocative\" and political activity is banned, including demonstrations. Holding a political meeting outdoors is punishable by up to five years in prison.\nThe restrictions were loosened slightly in September when indoor political meetings were allowed to resume, but only with permission from the police and with no more than 50 people in attendance.\nAccording to a monthly public perception survey by a consortium of civil society organizations called the Election Working Group, the share of Bangladeshis who expressed high confidence in the caretaker government fell between March and September, while the share of those who had low confidence sharply increased. This was true of respondents from \"ordinary\" and \"elite\" socioeconomic groups.\nIn the latest survey, conducted in face-to-face interviews in late September, the rising price of essential commodities was identified as the biggest concern, and even as the government got good marks for cracking down on corruption, respondents were divided about whether the government had any bearing on their daily lives: 42 percent of them said they were \"better off\" but about the same percentage said they were \"worse off or that there has been no change in their personal situation.\"\nThe government's anticorruption crusade continues to be seen as a turning point for Bangladesh, which has consistently ranked at the bottom of the annual Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index.\nBank accounts have been frozen. Luxury cars have been impounded by the state, or hidden indoors by their owners for fear they will be taken. Nearly 100 prominent politicians and business people have been taken in for questioning, and an unknown number of people have been detained without charge, which is legal under the new emergency laws. A little more than a dozen have been convicted by anticorruption courts, and how quickly, or fairly, the other cases will be tried is unclear.\nIf entrenched corruption was seen as damaging the economy, the crackdown has also sent shocks through the private sector. The government appears to be retreating from its initial wide sweep and has in recent months, released some detainees.\n\"Informally, the government wants some sort of reassurance for the business community that they will be allowed to function,\" said Akbar Ali Khan, a retired senior government official. He declined to grade the government's overall performance (criticizing the government is now a punishable offense) except to say that it was vital for the government to prepare for elections and restore business leaders' confidence in the country.\n\"The economic problems are very serious and acute,\" he said. \"These will have to be addressed with more vigor.\"\nAbdul Awal Mintoo, the chairman and chief executive of Multimode Group, was among the most prominent millionaires taken into custody in May on a vague charge of destabilizing the government, then released six months later. Mintoo said that while he was in custody he was interrogated less about his own assets than about what evidence he could furnish against Hasina, the Awami League leader and a former prime minister with whom Mintoo was friendly.\nA naturalized United States citizen, Mintoo returned to his native Bangladesh 27 years ago and established a number of businesses, from dealing in agricultural seeds to real estate. He estimates his assets in Bangladesh to be $30 million.\nMintoo, 58, insists that he did not bribe anyone in government in exchange for contracts. But he concedes that he did what he says everyone else has long had to do in this country: grease the wheels of politics and government to get basic things done, including installing a telephone line and getting imported machine parts out of customs. If that were the grounds for his arrest, he said, then \"50 million people, every adult male\" should be arrested.\n\"It's aimless what they're doing,\" he said of the government in an interview, and added that he planned to divest himself of his investments in the country slowly. \"I'm not sure how this will end up. I don't want to take a risk and live in uncertainty.\"\n\"If you take blood out of the arteries,\" he added, \"it just paralyzes.\"\nThe only charge remaining pending against Mintoo accuses him of extorting about $700 from a private citizen. Mintoo laughed at the charge, saying it was too paltry a sum for him to demand of anyone.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"6274fbdc-2a17-44ed-a005-9b5a4ccdd7fd","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T08:38:14.062+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"6fb7ab8a-4ef0-43ce-8819-0e3dcbdfe6de","content":"Change Is in the Air as Thailand Prepares to Vote\n2001-01-06T05:00:00.000Z\nStrange things have been happening in Thailand's deeply corrupt electoral process as the nation prepares to vote for a new Parliament on Saturday.\nPlenty of cash is still being handed out, but it is mostly hidden. Some candidates are buying votes with trips to the beach, scholarships, village development projects or temple donations with strings attached. One candidate hid so much fertilizer -- a gift for rural voters -- on the top floor of a building that cracks appeared in its walls.\nThe leading candidate for prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, has been charged by a countercorruption commission of hiding his assets by transferring stocks to his household help.\nThings used to be a lot easier for what one newspaper here calls Thailand's ''election animals.'' Strict new rules have been put in place to combat corruption and vote-buying, and candidates are fighting back with imaginative new tricks. It is a risky game. If they are caught, they could be summarily eliminated and barred from office.\nBut more is at stake than the shape of the next government. The election is the latest and fiercest battleground in Thailand's slow, hard-fought democratic revolution.\nThe country's efforts at reform have put it at the forefront of a difficult and uneven shift throughout the region toward more democracy and openness, in politics and government as well as in economics. The hierarchical, father-knows-best approach sometimes called ''Asian values'' is on the defensive.\n''You can see the democratic trend all the way from South Korea to Taiwan to Thailand to the Philippines to Indonesia, and then across to South Asia in places like Bangladesh,'' said Muthiah Alagappa, a senior fellow at the East-West Center in Honolulu. ''The wave in Asia is towards more open political systems. But the movement is going to be gradual and contested and with some reversals.''\nSome see Thailand as a test for peaceful reform in the region.\n''Everyone is watching whether this election will produce a legitimate government and what will happen next,'' said Kavi Chongkitavarn, a political analyst at the English-language daily The Nation.\nIn almost every arena, Thailand is changing -- or trying to change. A liberal Constitution passed in the wake of the regional economic crisis of 1997 calls for far-reaching reforms with an election commission, an anti-corruption commission, a freedom of information act and a soon-to-be activated commission on human rights.\nThe country's long tradition of top-down government is also being challenged by an increasingly vigorous civil society as individuals and groups insist on being heard.\nThe regional trend has its recent roots in Asia's decade-long economic boom in the 1980's and 1990's, when authoritarian rule came under challenge as Western wealth and ideas flooded in. In Thailand and Indonesia, resistance grew to the political dominance of the military.\nThe changes received a second push from the crash of 1997, which spurred political change -- or at least political challenge -- around Asia. Unaccountable governments that had bought social peace with growing prosperity suddenly found their legitimacy questioned.\n''All the bad luck that has happened to Thailand may have been blessings in disguise; it woke people up,'' said Sunai Phasuk, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, referring to the military crackdowns of the 1970's and of 1992, as well as to the economic shock of three years ago. It was external pressures like these that forced former President Suharto from office in Indonesia in 1998, emboldening the opposition and shaking his one-man rule.\nThough other countries may be more peaceful, every one of them is feeling the undercurrents of change.\n''All the countries of the region are going through this process,'' said William J. Klausner, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University. ''It's just a question of where you are on the spectrum.''\nIn Malaysia, the entrenched and overbearing government now must take into account an invigorated political opposition and nongovernmental groups that are making themselves heard as never before in the 19-year rule of its patriarch, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.\nSingapore, as always, has things well under control, but its always calculating leaders are tinkering, aware that they must loosen things up to stay at the forefront of the new fast-moving world economy.\nVietnam is changing despite the hesitancy of its leaders. Still Marxist, still hidebound, they have committed themselves to the increased transparency and accountability that are the price of entry into the world marketplace. The original domino in the cold war, it now faces the prospect of becoming, in the words of Mr. Sunai, one of the new ''dominos of democracy.''\nLaos, Cambodia and Myanmar -- the former Burma -- with their strongman governments, have two options: liberalize or find themselves being left behind, poorer and poorer, relics of the past.\nThe Philippines, as always, is a special case. The region's democratic standard-bearer, its uneven fortunes have sometimes been a justification, sometimes a rebuke to Southeast Asia's strongmen. It is now demonstrating how messy democracy can be with President Joseph Estrada in the midst of an impeachment trial on corruption charges.\nIn Thailand, almost every institution is being scrutinized and challenged, from the judiciary to the police to the Ministry of Interior to the Buddhist establishment to the corrupt and bloated government bureaucracy.\nSmall skirmishes fill the newspapers here almost every day: parents fighting against favoritism in school admissions, patients suing doctors for malpractice, farmers protesting against dam projects, villagers complaining about factories' pollution.\nAnd the old guard fights back; the stakes are the wealth and power structure of a nation.\n''The old system is not just going to go away,'' Mr. Klausner said. ''They are fighting every day. That's the excitement of it. A lot of people are frustrated because the game has not been won, but we are in the midst of a process, and it's a struggle.''","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"6fb7ab8a-4ef0-43ce-8819-0e3dcbdfe6de","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T08:46:55.463+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"719f0902-09cb-4521-a5f4-23c519158717","content":"Will Humans Overwhelm the Earth? The Debate Continues\n1998-12-08T05:00:00.000Z\nTwo hundred years ago the Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus, an English economist and mathematician, anonymously published an essay predicting that the world's burgeoning human population would overwhelm the Earth's capacity to sustain it.\nMalthus's gloomy forecast, called ''An Essay on the Principle of Population As it Affects the Future Improvement of Society,'' was condemned by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and many other theorists, and it was still striking sparks last week at a meeting in Philadelphia of the American Anthropological Society. Despite continuing controversy, it was clear that Malthus's conjectures are far from dead.\nAmong the scores of special conferences organized for the 5,000 participating anthropologists, many touched directly or indirectly on the Malthusian dilemma: Although global food supplies increase arithmetically, the population increases geometrically -- a vastly faster rate. The consequence, Malthus believed, was that poverty and the misery it imposes will inevitably increase unless the population increase is curbed.\nThis contention has prompted endless debate. Malthus's critics, especially the utopians of his time, have argued that man's ingenuity will always keep pace with population growth by finding improved ways to produce food.\nRecent assaults on Malthusian pessimism have cited the success of the ''Green Revolution'' launched in the 1950's and 1960's by Dr. Norman Borlaug and his associates in developing high-yield strains of rice and wheat.\nBut the scientific descendants of Malthus argue that feeding the world's masses is only part of the problem. Just as dangerous, they contend, is the omnivorous consumption of nonrenewable resources, the irreversible destruction of habitats and species, the fouling of the air and seas and consequent changes in climate, and many other effects of the growing human horde.\nOne of the symposiums held at last week's meeting was so controversial that a conference with the same title had been banned from the 1994 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science on the grounds (according to its organizer, Dr. Warren M. Hern, a Colorado physician and epidemiologist) that ''You may not ask that question.''\nThe question, posed as the title of the symposium, was this: ''Is the Human Species a Cancer on the Planet?''\nDr. Hern, the director of an abortion clinic in Boulder, Colo., noticed nearly a decade ago that aerial and satellite views of urban centers taken over a period of years bore a striking similarity to images of cancerous tissue (particularly melanoma) invading the healthy surrounding tissue.\nIn his presentation last week, Dr. Hern argued that in many parts of the world the increase in human numbers is rapid and uncontrolled, that it invades and destroys habitats, and that by killing off many species it reduces the differentiation of nature. All of these features are characteristic of cancerous tumors, he said.\nThis assessment was applauded by another member of the panel, Dr. Lynn Margulis of the University of Massachusetts, Boston, who is known for her coauthorship of another highly controversial theory known as the ''Gaia Hypothesis.''\nThe Gaia idea, the brainchild of an English theorist, Dr. James E. Lovelock, and Dr. Margulis, who is a microbiologist, is that the entire Earth deploys feedback mechanisms to maintain an environment hospitable to life. In this it resembles a gigantic living organism, proponents of the idea believe.\nLife on Earth has survived many crises, including mass extinctions caused by the impacts of asteroids and comets, Dr. Margulis said, and life will continue despite the threats created by humanity -- but with reduced diversity.\nShe agreed with the notion that the human race is a kind of self-destructive cancer.\n''For millions of years the Earth got along without human beings,'' she said, ''and it will do so again. The only question is the nature of the human demise that has already begun.''\nDr. Margulis quoted a line from the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche: ''The Earth is a beautiful place, but it has a pox called man.''\nA different but complementary perspective was offered by Dr. Compton J. Tucker, a physical scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Space Center. Dr. Tucker is an analyst of images of the Earth made by Landsat and other orbiting spacecraft. In particular, he keeps track of deforestation and other anthropogenic changes in the global habitat.\n''In many regions, we've seen astonishingly rapid change since 1975,'' he said. ''Vast tracts of both rain forest and dry tropical forest have disappeared in the Amazon Basin as human communities expand and clear the land for cattle ranching. This has led to a monoculture dominated by cattle breeding, with losses of immense numbers of the species deprived of forest habitat.''\nSeveral speakers cited United Nations statistics indicating that population growth rates in underdeveloped countries averaged only 1.77 percent a year between 1990 and 1995. The expectation for that period had been for a growth rate of 1.88 percent. This suggests that the increase in the population growth rate in underdeveloped countries declined somewhat during that five-year period.\nBut since 1930, when the world population was about 2 billion, the population has nearly tripled, and each doubling has occurred in a much shorter time period than the previous doubling period. The United Nations report projected that the world population could reach 9.4 billion by the year 2050.\nDemographers say that the population increase has leveled off in China (where the government limits family size) and that the rate of population increase has declined in Bangladesh and some other populous countries.\nBut recent United Nations statistics identified 28 countries (20 of them in Africa) where fertility rates increased during the past decade. Among these countries was the United States, which has the third largest population after China and India, and where the fertility rate increased from 1.9 to 2.1 percent, largely because of Hispanic immigration.\nAll the speakers at the symposium had expected vigorous criticism from the audience of anthropologists, but were surprised to encounter few strongly negative comments.\n''Arguments over the accuracy of Malthus's views, future population trends and the Earth's carrying capacity are never-ending and never resolved,'' one speaker said. ''Many people prefer to just forget about the big questions involved, and get on with their lives.''\nAt another symposium held at last week's meeting participants were asked to address the question ''Was Malthus Right?'' None of the panelists called Malthus's assessment of the grim consequences of overpopulation wrong, although some argued that he had some details wrong.\n''Most biologists would say that Darwin's work was mostly correct despite some errors in detail,'' said Dr. Kenneth Wise, an anthropologist at Pennsylvania State University. ''In the same sense it is fair to say that Malthus was mostly right. He took the prospect of technological innovation into account but still foresaw social inequities and growing misery as inevitable.\n''Facing up to dangerous ideas is not the same thing as advocating them,'' Dr. Wise said.\nPopulation pressure is partly a question of perception, said Dr. Bernice A. Kaplan, an anthropologist at Wayne State University.\n''I ask my students how they feel about being increasingly crowded by the growing population, and they reply, 'We're not crowded,' '' Dr. Kaplan said.\n''That attitude results from being young and not having experienced the changes old people have seen during their lives. Whatever environment you're born into is the one that seems normal.\n''You don't seem to realize the problems created by population pressure until you get old, and then nobody listens to you. We are a species that doesn't respond to threats until it's too late,'' she said.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"719f0902-09cb-4521-a5f4-23c519158717","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T08:47:09.901+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"750b1e49-ed6f-40d4-a828-dd5a96d94933","content":"Monsoon Hangs On, Swamping Bangladesh\n1998-09-07T05:00:00.000Z\nFor two months, the people of this village have been marooned on the tin roofs of their shacks, unwilling to abandon their homesteads even as the Jamuna River engulfed them in the longest-lasting flood in the history of this disaster-prone country.\nMohammad Harunuddin Sheik and his wife, Sufia, keep all-night vigils to make sure their daughters, Taslima, 4, and Shujon, 2, do not roll off the platform where they sleep and drown in the tea-brown water that laps a few feet below.\n''I don't know how God will save us,'' he said as he gestured at the vast expanse of water surrounding his home. ''All my crops were destroyed. Where will I get seeds to plant next year?''\nThese villagers are among more than 20 million Bangladeshis whose homes have been swamped by monsoon floods that have lasted almost two months, twice as long as any other recorded. The waters have inundated more than half the country, killed more than 520 people, closed many roads, wiped out a big chunk of the rice crop and threaten to bring deadly diarrhea and other diseases.\nIn an interview the Prime Minister, Sheik Hasina Wazed, pleaded for international aid. So far, relief agencies and foreign donors have pledged $82 million, but that is less than a tenth of what she has requested in food, medicine and reconstruction of Bangladesh, one of the poorest nations on earth.\n''Without help, the people will suffer,'' she said. ''At first we thought we would be able to address this situation alone. But the flood has stayed on for two months.''\nRelief officials here worry that the need to help the victims of the epic flooding in China, the famine in the Sudan and war in the Congo has slowed the response to Bangladesh's calamity.\nThe misery is not limited to the countryside. More than half of Dhaka, a capital of nine million people, is flooded -- including its landfills. With no place to dump garbage, people are throwing it into the putrid floodwaters. And since the poor have no toilets, the waters are soiled with their waste.\n''Water is everywhere, but you can't use it for any purpose,'' said Mohammad Reazuddin, who directs the Dhaka division of the national Department of Environment.\nSlum dwellers especially have no escape. In places the water has turned black and thick, but people still wade through it and wash their dishes in it and even drink it.\nAlready more than 130,000 Bangladeshis have developed diarrhea, a wasting condition spread by foul water and rotting food, and more than 100 have died of the disease. The World Bank estimates that 3.5 million of the 125 million Bangladeshis will be afflicted with diarrhea during the flood and its aftermath. The incidence will increase after the floods recede because of the filthy sludge left behind.\nAt the International Center for Diarrheal Disease and Research, hundreds of babies and children lie listless or squalling on cots. Alea Begum, a widow, brought in her son, Moieen, 12, and she now rests her hand on his bony chest. He is frighteningly still.\nThis wraith of a boy, his eyes overlarge in a gaunt face, is the family breadwinner because his father is dead. Each day he sloshed into the floodwaters to catch fish with his bare hands. Some days he caught nothing. On others he managed to snare enough fish to sell for 25 taka, about 50 cents. That kept him, his mother and his two little sisters from always going hungry.\nThe causes of this disaster are in some ways as murky as the water.\nBangladesh has had heavier than usual monsoon rains this year, but most of the floodwater has come from the great rivers that rise in the Himalayas, course through India, then empty into Bangladesh. Torrential rains in Uttar Pradesh, in northern India, have contributed to extensive flooding there, killing more than 1,000, leaving millions homeless and swelling the Ganges as it rushes through the plains to Bangladesh.\n[Officials said on Sunday that the Ganges had risen past its highest recorded level, surpassing the crest reached in 1988 when floods killed more than 2,000 people, Agence France-Presse reported.]\nBut normally the floods in Bangladesh would last just a few weeks, then the waters would empty into the Bay of Bengal. This year is different because the sea level is higher, trapping the flood in low-lying Bangladesh. Stagnant waters breed mosquitoes that swarm the streets of Dhaka, leading relief workers to fear an outbreak of malaria.\nOfficials here say they lack the sophisticated equipment to analyze the reasons for the higher sea level, but they offer some possible reasons.\nThey say earthquakes that shook the floor of the Indian Ocean last month may be a factor. They also wonder whether global warming is causing both the sea level to rise and snows to melt in greater volume in the Himalayas, feeding the rivers that rush into Bangladesh.\nThis Sunday's full moon will keep the sea level high, but A. T. M. Huda, the secretary of the Ministry of Water Resources, said he believes that the waters will begin receding by mid-September.\nThe greatest challenge now is to get food and medicine to people stuck beyond the roads erased by flooding. Supplies cannot be airdropped because the waters would swallow them up. Boats are the answer, but it will take money and organization to mobilize them, said Julian Francis, deputy director here for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\nIn the longer term, the victims need paid work helping to rebuild roads, schools and hospitals so they will have the income to buy food, rather than relying on the inefficient Government to hand it out. Studies of past famines have found that shortage of food was less of a problem than people's inability to pay for it, said Forrest E. Cookson, country representative of Development in Democracy, a private consulting firm in Dhaka.\nAll across Bangladesh, it is apparent that urban laborers and small farmers are unable to make a living because of the floods.\nIn Gulshan, an upscale neighborhood in Dhaka that is home to diplomats and wealthy business executives, small country boats ferry people to their gated homes. Along the streets, the poor made homeless by the floods have thrown up makeshift shanties, wooden platforms covered with plastic.\nMaksuda Paul Begum lives in one shanty with three of her four daughters. Her husband, a laborer, had gone to fetch the fourth, who had been taken to her grandmother's to get away from the floods. One night, the mother and her young children all crouched in the cramped space, just three feet high, their faces illuminated by lightning and the flickering of a kerosene lamp.\nWhile her husband is gone, they live on bags of rice and lentils provided at relief centers. ''Hunger is part of life,'' she said. When the rich drive by in their Land Rovers and Jeeps, she said, they create waves that slosh over her platform. Her sari was sopping wet. Her children have been sick with fever, colds and rashes.\nThree hours' drive from Dhaka, the road disappears into the floodwaters at Aricha, on the Jamuna River, and the only way to Chor Shibola village is by boat.\nTara Banu, who guesses she is 45 or 50, and her son Mohammad Lalchan Hossain, 25, were standing on the rooftop, safe for the moment from the chest-high water that has risen through their small hut and destroyed the rice they had planted.\nShe had to sell her family's three cows to pay for food. ''We have no income,'' she explained. Next year, when the family needs cows again to plow the fields, she will have to borrow the money to replace them from a local moneylender who charges interest of 100 percent a year, potentially sinking them into a debt that could chain them to the lender for life.\nMr. Hossain was busy weaving a contraption of bamboo that he hopes to use to catch shrimp that they could eat or sell.

Farmers invest less in their own land and children leave home, searching for a better life in cities. Consumers in those ever-swelling cities become increasingly dependent for their supplies of food on farmers elsewhere.\nBut farmers, especially those in the poorest nations, are not just battling a global oversupply of grain. In a distressing number of cases, they are fighting against the financial power of the world's richest governments.\nDuring recent years, industrialized countries spent, on average, about $7 billion each year subsidizing their exports of agricultural commodities such as wheat, flour, cheese, butter, poultry and beef. These programs typically work in the following way: The government buys agricultural commodities at above-market prices, benefiting their own farmers. Then those commodities flood into international markets, pushing down prices worldwide.\nAs surely as drought or any other natural disaster, those subsidized exports sap life from rural villages in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Urban consumers around the world may benefit, in the short run, from the supply of cheap food. The harm, however, far outweighs the benefit. Agricultural production can be crippled in countries that need it most.\nThis is where the World Trade Organization can help. The same body that has been vilified as a tool of multinational corporations and rich countries may be the Third World farmer's best hope, perhaps the only one, in the battle against unfair competition from subsidized agricultural exports.\nWhen WTO members meet in Geneva on Thursday and Friday to discuss agriculture issues, they will begin to address this problem. Previous trade negotiations, concluded in 1994, succeeded in limiting some export subsidies. Now is the time to abolish these subsidies altogether, along with similar unfair practices.\nOf course, some would argue that free trade itself is driving down the price of agricultural goods worldwide, and that the WTO, by promoting free trade, is destroying rural communities in the developing world.\nNo one can deny that free trade is sometimes disruptive (although the absence of free trade has proven even more disruptive and costly). This is why the WTO's rules recognize that food is something special. Poor countries such as Bangladesh and Tanzania are allowed a great deal of freedom to protect and promote domestic food production. They are permitted, for instance, to set up grain banks for food security reasons, which tend to support prices. They are also allowed to provide cut-rate fertilizer and seeds to the most vulnerable farmers.\nUnfortunately, the WTO uses the wrong criteria to determine which countries need these special exemptions. Under the current definitions, relatively well-off developing countries can qualify, along with others that are desperately poor. Oddly enough, they do not take into consideration real-life measures such as the number of malnourished people living within a country. WTO members need to establish a new category of \"food-insecure\" countries, those for whom famine is just one catastrophic harvest away, and support domestic agriculture in those nations.\nThese are only the first of many good deeds that the WTO could carry out in the cause of abolishing hunger and poverty.\nConsider, as another example, the phenomenon of \"tariff escalation.\" Cocoa bean growers in poor countries face almost no tariffs when shipping their harvest to developed countries. Yet if those poor countries set up factories to turn their beans into cocoa butter, and tried to ship this to rich countries' markets, they would have to pay substantial tariffs. If they tried to manufacture and export finished chocolate bars, the tariffs would be higher still. In this way, industrialized countries protect their industries and prevent poorer countries from taking full advantage of the raw materials that they possess. The WTO is the one organization that may be capable of reducing tariff escalation.\nCan the WTO protect the interests of the world's poor and hungry? Pessimists may doubt it, pointing out that a handful of the world's wealthiest nations set up the WTO and continue to play a dominant rule in its operations.\nBut the WTO at least provides a system of rules for world trade. In fact some developing countries have won landmark WTO cases against more powerful nations. The rules may not be perfect, but they are certainly better than no rules at all. When all that counts is raw power, the small and weak are likely to suffer most.\nThe WTO cannot make sure that everyone on the planet gets enough to eat. But it can help to prevent unfair competition that hurts the poor. We urge WTO members to keep in mind the challenge of reducing hunger and poverty during their upcoming meeting.\nEugenio Diaz Bonilla is a research fellow and Sherman Robinson is the director of the Trade and Microeconomics Division at the International Food Policy Research Institute.

Six of the first eight months of the year were the warmest since records began in 1866.\nThe accelerating pace of climate change is out of step with the glacial pace of climate negotiations, which have been frozen since the Kyoto protocol was crafted at an international meeting in Japan a year ago. Unless the government officials who convene in Buenos Aires this Monday for a new round of climate negotiations can plug the loopholes in the protocol and pave the way for its ratification, there is a serious risk that it will never be adopted. This will nullify a decade of efforts to protect the climate.\nThe warning signs are clear. Even before 1998, the 14 hottest years on record had occurred since 1980. University of Massachusetts researchers say that recent temperatures are the warmest in 600 years.\nScientists believe that we are in effect creating a more feverish planet by adding billions of tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The symptoms — higher temperatures and more hot and dry spells — are likely to be seen in the form of more severe weather. One factor in the extreme weather of 1998 has been the periodic El Niño warming of the eastern Pacific. But the severity of the recent El Niño, the most extreme so far, may itself be a manifestation of human-induced climate change.\nSome 56 countries have been hit by severe floods this year, and at least 45 were stricken by drought. China was particularly hard hit, suffering an estimated $36 billion in losses due to the flooding of the Yangtze River basin. This is an amount equal to nearly 5 percent of the country's annual economic output. An estimated 2,500 Chinese were killed and 56 million were displaced by the floods, the country's worst in 44 years.\nBangladesh had to endure an unusually severe monsoon season, which left two-thirds of the country, including much of the capital, Dhaka, underwater for more than a month. About 21 million people were made homeless.\nWorldwide economic losses from storms, floods, droughts and other weather-related natural disasters totaled an estimated $72 billion during the first seven months of 1997, exceeding the record of $60 billion for the full 12 months of 1996.\nA more unstable climate is causing record-breaking heat waves. One hundred Texans died in a prolonged summer heat spell during which temperatures in Dallas rose above 35 degrees centigrade for weeks on end. An estimated 3,000 people died in India's most intense heat wave in 50 years.\nClimate disruption is leading to the spread of infectious diseases. Rising temperatures and more persistent rainfall allow tropical and subtropical diseases to move into new areas. In the past year, tens of thousands of Africans were affected by Rift Valley fever, and 200 died, after the heaviest rains since 1961. The World Health Organization has documented \"quantitative leaps\" in the incidence of malaria in the past several years. Outbreaks of cholera have occurred in the region immediately surrounding Buenos Aires.\nOne of the planet's most prominent \"hot spots\" lies south of the southern tip of Argentina, in Antarctica. The peninsula has warmed up by 2.5 degrees centigrade since the mid-1940s. According to a research team of the U.S. Geological Survey, Antarctica is warmer now than at any time in the last 4,000 years.\nIn March, a 200-square-kilometer block of ice broke away from the Larsen B ice shelf, shrinking the shelf to its smallest size on record. Last month an iceberg of 7,125 square kilometers in area separated from the Ronne ice shelf. Scientists with the British Antarctic Survey believe that the Larsen B shelf may be on the verge of entering an \"irreversible retreat phase.\" They are also concerned about the collapse of the larger West Antarctic ice sheet, which could raise sea levels by as much as 5 meters and inundate coastal regions.\nHalf the glacier ice in the European Alps has disappeared in the last century. The famous ice field in America's Glacier National Park is shrinking fast, as are the glaciers in the Patagonian Andes along the Argentine border.\nAccelerated temperature change is giving an ironic twist to our notion of \"glacial pace.\" As climate change picks up speed, it is the international political process that is now moving at the pace we used to associate with huge fields of ice.\n-\nMr. Flavin is senior vice president and Mr. Dunn is a research associate at the Worldwatch Institute, a nongovernmental organization based in Washington which monitors changes in the environment.

A greater frequency of droughts and floods, he added, could be particularly bad for agriculture.\n\"Rain-fed agriculture in marginal areas in semi-arid and sub-humid regions is mostly at risk,\" Diouf said Tuesday on a visit to the southern Indian city of Madras. \"India could lose 125 million tons of its rain-fed cereal production, equivalent to 18 percent of its total production.\"\nThat is a signal of the steep human and economic impact of extreme weather in India, where a majority of peasants still rely on the rains to irrigate their fields and where a bad flood can be nearly as devastating as a bad drought. The latest floods have affected an estimated 20 million people in India alone, and an additional eight million in neighboring Bangladesh and 300,000 in Nepal, according to the UN children's agency.\nThe World Meteorological Organization said in a statement released on Tuesday that the region experienced double the normal number of monsoon depressions in the first half of the four-month rainy season that started in June, causing heavy rainfall and flooding across South Asia.\nNearly a third of India's meteorological districts received higher-than-average rainfall, according to government figures. The latest tally released by the Home Ministry reads like an inventory of ruin: nearly 8,000 square miles of agricultural land inundated since the start of the monsoon two months ago; more than 130,000 houses destroyed; 1,428 people killed.\nGovernment relief teams have fanned out across the northern states of Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, dropping relief packets by air. Even as the rains stopped over the last couple of days, stagnant water raised the risks of water-borne disease, from diarrhea to dengue fever, in areas that are already among the nation's poorest and least healthy. There have been no reports of disease outbreaks yet.\nIndia stands to bear the brunt of some of the worst effects of climate change, in large measure because it is ill-prepared.

But the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said Monday that reports from officials who had been to the most affected areas led the organization to expect that the final toll would be in line with the government's official assessment.\nThe officially confirmed death toll from the cyclone reached 3,113, said Lieutenant Colonel Main Ullah Chowdhury, a spokesman of the army, according to The Associated Press. He added that 3,322 are injured and 1,063 missing.\nHe said reports were finally reaching the capital, Dhaka, from the storm-ravaged areas, which had been largely isolated because roads had been washed out and telephone lines had been knocked down, The AP reported.\n\"What we are seeing on the ground is not as horrifying,\" said Devendra Tak, a senior regional spokesman for the federation, who spoke from Khulna, a town in southern Bangladesh, after visiting some of the worst affected districts the furious cyclone had hit last week as it packed winds of 240 kilometers, or 140 miles, an hour. \"We don't see the level of destruction that we had feared earlier.\"\nTak said thousands of fishermen who had been missing along the coastal areas and presumed dead had begun to turn up in their villages.\n\"We are very optimistic that the overall disaster will not be on a very high level,\" Tak said by telephone.\nOther relief agencies said that they were waiting for a fuller picture to emerge and that the final death toll could still be significantly higher. Usha Mishra, a senior adviser at the UN World Food Program, said that food supplies had been severely disrupted, and that there was risk of famine.\nShe said the program had begun to distribute some food, including high energy biscuits.\nBut she said more serious emergency operations were being considered, including broader food distribution and rebuilding of homes.\n\"Shelter is the big need right now,\" she said. \"One million people have been turned homeless.\"\nShe said the cyclone had devastated farming land that had already been severely damaged by earlier flooding in August.\n\"We do face a prospect of some remote areas not getting some\" supplies, she said. \"We might see starvation in some areas.\"","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[{"tagged_token_id":"abdb3132-8dae-4843-b61c-3094cdc2ed21","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"935b3b9f-244a-437c-aebc-7cc3aa3088b1","start":868,"end":873,"tag":"fatalities","tag_id":"69f4e5af-f7a5-4631-aaf4-2f4704e347d5","value":"3,113","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:01:57.125+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"74dfe642-f94f-4631-bd62-91a5cbc36563","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"935b3b9f-244a-437c-aebc-7cc3aa3088b1","start":43,"end":67,"tag":"end date context","tag_id":"88cf8c2b-74e5-4ceb-8d00-3c3b56f4dacb","value":"2007-11-19T05:00:00.000Z","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:03:49.86+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"33a7ad06-d792-4583-94d1-fbdc87b0c6fe","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"935b3b9f-244a-437c-aebc-7cc3aa3088b1","start":843,"end":859,"tag":"Flood type","tag_id":"6de6f201-e6f3-46be-845f-21a8d8190680","value":"from the cyclone","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:02:11.556+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"935b3b9f-244a-437c-aebc-7cc3aa3088b1","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:00:39.038+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"949b1c49-5931-4c17-a702-edc694f5a409","content":"Bangladesh appeals for cyclone aid\n2007-11-20T05:00:00.000Z\nPATHARGHATA, Bangladesh — Bangladesh sought more foreign aid Tuesday to help thousands of survivors of Cyclone Sidr after the storm mauled villages along the country's coast and killed more than 3,100 people, according to an official tally that was expected to rise.\nFood, fresh water and temporary shelter have still not reached many of the hungry and exhausted survivors.\n\"At this time we will welcome support from the international community,\" said a statement from the Foreign Ministry. \"We are doing as best as we can do ourselves.\"\nThe government said international aid worth about $120 million had been promised.\nBut relief items such as tents, rice and water have been slow to reach most survivors of the worst cyclone to hit Bangladesh in a decade.\nAt Patharghata, a hard-hit trading town along the Bay of Bengal, more than 100 women gathered Tuesday hoping to get aid.\n\"I've been waiting here for several hours hoping to get some food and drinking water,\" said Safura Begum, who has three children. \"But I'm not sure it will come.\n\"Some biscuits and a few bottles of water are what I've gotten in the past three days,\" she said.\nThe government is using helicopters to get aid to the survivors - many of whom are still living out in the open.

Dangerous levels of arsenic have been found in the ground water, entering millions of people sip by sip as they drink from a vast system of tube wells. Most of these hand-operated pumps are 10 to 20 years old, about the same period it takes the arsenic to do its lethal work, killing with one of several cancers.\nThe unfolding crisis is the unintended consequence of a colossally successful safe-water program. For 25 years, the Government along with Unicef and other aid groups have weaned villagers from disease-carrying pond water and helped them to sink pipes into underground aquifers. Overlooked was the naturally occurring arsenic that tainted these subterranean sources.\nDoctors and aid workers told Pinjira Begum, 25, of this calamity as they explained to her how seriously ill she was. But news that her misery had a huge amount of company was no consolation to a mother of three with her 4-month-old daughter, Juthi, in her arms. Too many other indignities were rushing into her life.\nHer husband had decided that she was no longer of use to him. ''She was pretty once, but now she is too thin and smells bad and is uglier by the day,'' he said.\nOn Oct. 21, using a man's traditional right in these Islamic hinterlands, Masud Rahman, 25, took a second wife. Now, as Pinjira's fevered body seems to melt in the bed, her husband sleeps a few feet away with a new bride.\nThese days, such heart-breaking stories are in large supply in Bangladesh and the neighboring Indian state of West Bengal. People come out of their one-room, mud-floored homes and show the skin lesions on the palms of their hands and soles of their feet. These ulcers are advanced signs of arsenic poisoning.\nEstimating how many lives the arsenic will eventually claim is a multiplication problem with as yet too many unknowns: how many people are drinking the poison, how long have they been doing it, and when will they stop.\n''Arsenic in drinking water poses the highest cancer risk ever found,'' said Dr. Allan H. Smith, an epidemiologist at the University of California at Berkeley who this year has made three trips to Bangladesh for the World Health Organization. ''But we still don't know how many millions have been exposed, and at what levels.\n''We could be talking about hundreds of thousands of deaths. We just don't know. The cumulative dose is what kills. Every day that people continue to drink the contaminated water could result in more arsenic-related deaths down the road in 5, 10 or 25 years. This really is a major emergency.''\nBabar N. Kabir, a World Bank hydrologist who is assessing the problem, believes that he is being conservative when he estimates that 18 million people are now poisoning themselves.\nIn late August, the World Bank announced that it would provide Bangladesh with a $32.4 million credit to develop an arsenic-control project because ''in a bizarre turn of events, tube wells have been secretly poisoning villagers.''\nThe Government will use much of the money to test every one of the nation's three-and-a-half to four million wells. Due to variations in the underground rock and soil, the arsenic can be absent in one place and appear in another barely 10 yards away.\n''It is a coordinator's nightmare, trying to collect all these samples and get accurate measurements,'' said Mr. Kabir, who is among those managing the effort. ''Of course, what do you tell people whose water is contaminated? They are going to want to know what you expect them to drink.''\nThe World Health Organization's safety standard for arsenic in water is a maximum of 0.01 milligrams per liter. But some countries, including Bangladesh and India, consider five times that amount to be acceptable.\nEarly samplings have found this higher level of arsenic in parts of 43 of Bangladesh's 64 districts.\nFew Resources For Saving Lives\n''If this were the United States, they'd call out the National Guard and get everyone bottled water,'' said Willard R. Chappell, a physicist who is one of the world's leading experts on arsenic contamination. ''But Bangladesh doesn't have the resources.''\nBangladesh has a per capita income of $266. About 70 percent of its 126 million people are small farmers, toiling in the endless rice paddies and sugar cane fields of the world's largest delta landscape. In the south, vast river systems weave across one other like giant braids before emptying into the Bay of Bengal.\nWater is everything to Bangladeshis, source of their bounty and cause of their cataclysms. In the wet summers, the snowmelt from the Himalayas joins with ferocious rains in a tantrum of floods that can drench two-thirds of the land. In dry months, the sun can parch the paddies so badly that only famine wields a scythe.\nUntil the 1970's, most villagers drank from hand-dug wells or natural ponds that they often shared with bathing cows and water buffaloes. Cholera and diarrheal diseases flourished in this water, and each year hundreds of thousands of deaths originated in the earthen pitchers that villagers carried to their porches.\nTo many, the solution to these onrushes of mortality were simple contraptions called tube wells. They are cylinders that are sunk into the ground, some with wide diameters for irrigation, others more narrow for pumping clean drinking water from the ever-replenished aquifers.\nUnicef was the main apostle of these wells, creating its own designs and providing the materials to the Bangladeshi Government, which, in turn, paid the drilling costs. This partnership sank one million tube wells; two-and-a-half to three million more were installed privately, some with loans on easy terms from other aid agencies.\n''Never, or at least up to now, did anyone expect arsenic to be in the ground water,'' said Aung Chein, Unicef's project officer for water in Bangladesh. ''One tested only surface water, especially to see if rivers and streams were polluted by chemicals and industrial waste.''\nWhile some experts now fault Unicef for failing to do exhaustive testing, there is no denying that the tube well program saved millions of lives. Unicef was able to boast that 97 percent of Bangladeshis were now within walking distance of ''safe'' water. Reliable statistics are hard to come by here, but there is general agreement that mortality rates due to diarrhea, the nation's major killer, have plunged.\nConvinced with great effort that ground water is the safest to drink, villagers are now beginning to be told that this is not necessarily so. Some people react with outrage, some stoicism. Almost all are baffled.\nIn Miapur, in northwest Bangladesh, the Government recently sealed up 8 contaminated wells only to have villagers undo the work. Pinjira Begum -- losing her hair, losing her strength, losing her husband -- continues to drink arsenic-laced water from the pump that sits beside a fruit tree behind her house. ''They tell me the water has made me sick, but others use this well, and they are not sick,'' she said.\nSome Are Affected; Others Seem Fine\nThe arsenic's slow creep affects people differently, with some family members showing signs of the poisoning while others do not. Pinjira Begum's husband seems fine, though their 10-year-old daughter already has telltale spotting across her chest.\nSome doctors suggest that nutrition may be a critical factor in who gets sick, but many villagers are inclined to attribute such things to the will of Allah or their own superstitions. There are those who believe that a poisoned well is a sign that a snake has been struck during the digging.\n''In most places, certainly in the interior villages, people don't know anything about the arsenic,'' said Khushi Kabir, who heads a coalition of private, nonprofit groups dealing with environmental issues. ''It took a long time to get people to use tube well water, and it will take a long time to get them to change.''\nIn Bilkeda, 25 miles west of the city of Pabna and a long hike from anything that could be called a road, Salim Uddin Mondal said that yes, his well had been tested and found to be contaminated. Still, he, his wife and their 7 children use it.\nHis tube well, like his farm animals, was a sign of his relative prosperity. The nearest safe water was now 50 yards away, requiring either a trip through a neighbor's front yard or a shortcut through a strand of jackfruit. This was too much of an inconvenience for Mr. Mondal, even though arsenic had already disfigured his hands until the palms were as hard and bumpy as stalks of cauliflower.\n''If I die, I will die, but I will not go to fetch water from another man's house,'' he said as his family listened, nodding in agreement.\nIn nearby Char Ruppur, Belal Hossain, 17, suffers from nerve damage, an occasional effect of arsenic. His gait is crooked, and his arms are bowed like a set of parentheses. His mother died on Sept. 25, and now he himself wonders what hard days lie ahead in his remnant life. He listened as his father described her death.\n''Her fingers began festering, and she had them removed,'' said Maqbal Hossain. ''Then she got this cough. There was a burning sensation all over her body, especially the elbow joints. The sores never went away. These hurt her terribly.''\nThere is no treatment for the poisoning, doctors say, though if a person stops drinking the arsenic at an early enough stage, physical decay can be arrested.\n''We know what causes the damage, and we know what to do about it: provide safe water,'' said Dr. Smith, the epidemiologist. ''We just need to do it.''\nThere is no shortage of proposals, like the harvesting of rain water and the installing of filters. But some seemingly simple ideas have simply failed. Chlorine tablets were distributed until it was shown that high concentrations of chlorine were more dangerous than the arsenic. Boiling surface water was advised, but this required an amount of fuel that few villagers could afford.\n''This is why the governments are afraid to tell the people, because they have no solution,'' said Dipankar Chakraborti, an analytical chemist.\nAn impassioned gadfly, Mr. Chakraborti has been arsenic's great Cassandra. He had done research on this chemical element in the United States. Then in 1988, during a visit to his parents in West Bengal, he learned that arsenic was suspected in the health problems of several villages. He collected water samples and took them abroad for sophisticated analyses in laboratories at the University of Antwerp in Belgium.\n''The more I surveyed, the more I saw the calamity,'' said Mr. Chakraborti, who now now runs an environmental science program at Jadavpur University in Calcutta. ''Government did not agree. They said I was creating a panic.''\nMr. Chakraborti surmised that arsenic-bearing minerals rested in sediments washed down from the Himalayas through the Ganges River system. Widespread use of tube wells lowered the water table, he said, and as oxygen filled the gap, a chemical reaction separated the arsenic from the minerals and rendered it into solution.\nRecently, other scientists have disputed this, theorizing that the lowering of the water table had no role in the poisoning. Rather, they say, the arsenic was naturally present in the water and is freed by bacteria that break down the mineral sediment.\nWhatever the cause, Mr. Chakraborti has continued to test wells and question villagers. He now estimates that 6 million Indians in West Bengal are drinking contaminated water and that 300,000 already show signs of the poisoning.\nCassandra Dismissed As an Alarmist\nEarly in his research, he grew sure that the arsenic not only sluiced through West Bengal but also crossed its eastern border. In 1994, he began sending letters to the Bangladeshi Government as well as Unicef and the World Health Organization. He was generally dismissed as an alarmist.\nBut he found willing allies among two doctors in Dhaka who had given up lucrative practices to start a small hospital for the poor. Quazi Quamruzzaman and Mahmadur Rahman had been treating many patients with the symptoms of arsenic poisoning. They went into debt to begin a nationwide sampling of the wells.\n''We did what the Government and the international agencies should have been doing,'' Dr. Rahman said. ''And what we found was a massive problem, and a pitiful one. People saw these lesions and thought they were leprosy. People were thrown out of villages. Couples got divorced. Girls couldn't get husbands.''\nSome Government officials in both India and Bangladesh admit that their response to the situation was slow. ''Maybe it was a lack of administrative support, maybe a lack of political will,'' said K. J. Nath, who has dealt with the issue for the Government's All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health.\nIndian officials have begun sealing contaminated wells, replacing them with longer pipes into a deeper aquifer. But they too face the problem of supplying an alternative. Besides, India is a medical encyclopedia of health problems.\n''One has to be rational and realistic,'' Mr. Nath said. ''India has 17 million people affected by tuberculosis, 7 million affected by diarrheal disease, 2 million by malaria. In that context, arsenic in West Bengal is not so serious.''\nIn Bangladesh, the Government appointed an arsenic committee in 1993, and some limited testing was done. ''Within the limits of the bureaucracy, we did what we could do,'' said Amin Uddin, retired now as the Government's chief engineer. ''We were concerned about creating a scare. If you tell people there is arsenic in the water, they won't even use it for bathing. They'll be afraid their hair will fall out.''\nWater-quality experts seem divided about whether negligence was involved in overlooking the arsenic. Although a few scientists say that studies detailing a similar, if smaller, arsenic problem in Taiwan were overlooked, most find it hard to fault anyone for not anticipating a situation they believe to have been unprecedented.\nAssessing Blame For Bad Management\nOne well-tempered view comes from Kazi Matin Ahmed, a Bangladeshi scientist who is studying the arsenic situation for the British Geological Survey.\n''These wells were introduced into the ground water in good faith and, they've saved countless lives,'' he said. ''But, saying that, you could have rightly expected Unicef to have known a lot sooner about the arsenic, especially after Dr. Chakraborti had issued his warnings. At the very least, someone must be blamed for bad management of such a vast system of water supply.''\nAt Unicef's headquarters in Dhaka, officials say it is unproductive to dwell on the past. They point out that the organization has taken a leading role among the many groups now studying the arsenic problem and looking for other ways to supply water. In the meantime, Unicef and the Government continue to install tube wells.\n''We are wedded to safe water, not tube wells, but at this time tube wells remain a good, affordable idea and our program will go on,'' said Shahida Azfar, Unicef's chief representative in Bangladesh.\nOne change has been made, however.\nWater is now tested for arsenic before and after any pump is installed.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"9f89b1d2-c8c0-4db2-8137-841d856f0817","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:22:17.492+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"a687aac0-31e4-44f7-ac7e-98ff4b159181","content":"A Nobel Prizewinner’s Hat Alters the Political Ring in Bangladesh\n2007-02-19T05:00:00.000Z\nNEW DELHI, Feb. 18 — The only version of democracy known to the small, crowded, flood-prone country known as Bangladesh has been a small, crowded, violence-prone contest between its two begums or ladies — as they are also known — who lead its two rival political parties, Sheik Hasina Wajed, of the Awami League, and Khaleda Zia, of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. \nOn Sunday, though, there was a significant shift of the tectonic plates of Bangladeshi politics as Muhammad Yunus, the founder of a microfinance empire known as the Grameen Bank and the winner of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, announced that he would start a new party and step into the electoral fray. \n“There is no way I can stay away from politics any longer — I am determined,” Mr. Yunus told reporters in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, according to Reuters. \nWhen that fray might begin is anyone’s guess. Democracy has been suspended for five weeks after the government declared an emergency and called off elections that had been scheduled for Jan. 22. The emergency measure was enacted after months of debilitating protest by the Awami League, which accused the last government, led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, of rigging the election process. The Awami League vowed to disrupt the voting. Chaos loomed. \nBangladesh, which became independent from Pakistan in 1971, has had long periods of military rule. Democracy was restored in 1991, after the toppling of Gen. H. M. Ershad. \nSince Jan. 11, when the emergency was declared, Bangladesh has been under the rule of a caretaker administration led by Fakhruddin Ahmed, a former central bank governor, and quietly supported by the army. Mr. Ahmed has promised to draft a new voter list, one of the Awami League’s main points of contention, and to issue voter identification cards before scheduling elections. That could potentially take months. The government has not yet issued a timetable for the elections. \nMr. Ahmed’s government has also vowed to cleanse politics of corruption and thuggery and has arrested several thousand people, including a handful of high-ranking politicians from the two parties. On Sunday, the government announced the names of several dozen politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen in Bangladesh who it said must account for their personal wealth or risk having it be confiscated by the state. Bangladesh has repeatedly appeared at or near the bottom of Transparency International’s annual corruption ranking, based on surveys of business executives and analysts. \nMr. Yunus has openly hinted at the notion of entering politics for several months. Last week, he issued an open letter, in effect asking Bangladeshis to tell him whether they would welcome his involvement in politics. “I, like you, witnessed where our political culture has brought the country and how it attempted to destroy the country’s future possibilities,” he wrote in his letter. “I know that joining politics is to become controversial. I am ready to take the risk if you think me joining politics will help in ushering of a new political climate.”\nIt is far too early to tell what kind of challenge his party could pose to the political organizations led by the two women.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"a687aac0-31e4-44f7-ac7e-98ff4b159181","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:22:31.244+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"ab89b0b9-5773-4a50-86d5-e6f2578fcbbc","content":"Shadowy Party Heats Up British Racial Tensions\n2001-07-04T05:00:00.000Z\nThe sudden spasm of racial violence that tore through this former mill town the last week in June, leaving in its wake burned-out stores, boarded-up windows and a shaken and angry population seemed on the surface to have come from nowhere.\nBut many Burnley residents say the growing influence of the shadowy British National Party, with its fascist roots and its implacable belief that England should be for whites only, was responsible for the violence as surely as if party leaders had stood in the streets and personally distributed firebombs to the rioters.\n''They're causing a lot of trouble,'' said Helen Smith, 52, a charity worker, pushing her baby granddaughter down St. James Street. ''Because of the B.N.P., whites here have become totally obsessed with the thought that the Pakistanis are taking over. And if you've got that obsession, it just gets bigger.''\nMrs. Smith said she knew exactly when the trouble had begun in Burnley, which has 92,000 people, about 7.5 percent of them nonwhite: when the party got 11.3 percent of the town's vote in the June 7 national elections.\nUntil then, few people realized that the party -- a more reasonably spoken, less confrontational version of the neo-Nazi National Front, which had its greatest influence in the 1970's -- had found such a foothold here.\n''It's taken us a long time to realize what was happening,'' said Stuart Caddy, the Burnley Borough Council leader, ''and we've been very poor at counteracting it. It's been a knock back for us, and we realize we've got to work hard to engage with the communities here and get a clear message across.''\nLike Oldham, about 20 miles southeast, which had its own racial violence in late May, Burnley became ethnically mixed in the 1960's.\nDuring that era, tens of thousands of people of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background took low-paying jobs in the cotton mills that fueled the economy in towns across the industrial northwest.\nThe newcomers settled in this town mostly in two predominantly Asian housing developments, Stoneyholme and Daneshouse, which together form the sixth most economically deprived spot in all of England, but many lost their jobs when the mills closed in the 70's and 80's.\nThose of Asian background in Burnley who do work tend to own small businesses, like corner shops and fast-food places, or to drive taxis.\nThere was always low-grade racism here, people say. The largest outbreaks of racial violence in Britain before have been concentrated in Afro-Caribbean neighborhoods in the south, like Brixton in London. The ethnic picture across the country began to change in the 1990's, when asylum seekers began arriving -- first in a trickle, and then in a flood, hundreds of thousands of them.\nEncouraged by often provocative language from the Conservative Party and, to a lesser extent, from the Labor government, Britons have become increasingly afraid that illegal immigrants are overrunning the country -- diluting Britishness and using scarce resources.\nRace relations has become one of the biggest anxieties facing the British electorate, recent polls indicate, and it is in this context that the British National Party has begun to thrive in a few areas.\nIt is a small party, with fewer than 10,000 members nationwide and dependent on grass-roots support, said Nick Griffin, the party chairman, who on June 7 took 16.4 percent of the vote in Oldham West, the party's best showing anywhere, in balloting for for a seat in the House of Commons.\nAside from the 11.3 percent the party won in Burnley, and 11.2 percent in Oldham East, it got 2 to 5 percent in other races around the country.\nSteve Smith, the regional organizer in Burnley, said the party's message -- that whites should fight for their heritage, that the multiracial society should be dismantled and that nonwhites should be given financial incentives to return to their countries of origin -- had touched a nerve.\n''The race relations industry is simply a massive propaganda machine designed to make people feel guilty about wanting to preserve their racial and cultural identity,'' Mr. Smith said. ''We've had multiracialism imposed on us for too long, and the indigenous population is being sidelined by the politically correct politicians who are running the country.''\nMr. Smith, 41, an accountant, spoke in his office on St. James Street, down from the town center, its windows boarded up as security against possible attacks.\nThe office has a dramatic decor with dark blue fleur-de-lis-patterned wallpaper and a chandelier overhead. On one wall an enormous red party banner calls to mind an old Soviet-realism poster. It bears a picture of Alfred the Great, the ninth-century king who is a nationalist symbol, and the party slogan: Freedom, security, identity, democracy.\nDownstairs, where Mr. Smith runs a shop and museum devoted to Burnley's heritage, an enormous German shepherd snoozed peacefully on the floor. In the copy machine tray there was a picture of Hitler.\nTo many whites in Burnley, Mr. Smith appears to be speaking plain good sense, particularly when he argues that the local council doles out too much money to Asians at the expense of whites. It is a sore point and a widespread perception, though one that is not true, the council says.\n''Asians get a much better deal,'' said Christine Witter, 29, pushing her 8-month-old baby -- her fourth child -- down the street. First there is housing, she said: Asians seem always able to jump the line ahead of whites for subsidized apartments and houses. ''I'm not racialist,'' Mrs. Witter said, ''but if they come to our country they should abide by our rules, and not get houses over us.''\nHer husband, Colin, said that he did not vote for the British National Party in the recent election -- he did not vote for anyone -- but that he sympathized with its message.\nWhen he monitors the police radio from his truck, he said, all he hears are accounts of Asians' cars being stopped and searched, and invariably drugs or weapons are found. But it is the whites who are more likely to be harassed by the police and arrested, he said.\n''There's too much ethnic niceness,'' Mr. Witter said. ''It's got to the point where the kids at school aren't allowed to say 'blackboard' -- they have to say 'chalkboard.' ''\nHis wife agreed. ''We're not allowed to say 'Paki,' '' a derogatory word for Pakistani, she said. ''I mean, if they're from Pakistan, they're a Paki, right? If they call you white scum, and you respond and call them black scum, the police take you in for racialist behavior. But nothing ever happens to the Asians.''\nFeelings are running high, too, on the other side of the town center, the scene of the riots. White and Asian youths fought in the streets, attacked cars, houses and businesses with baseball and cricket bats, faced off against the police and firebombed the Duke of York pub, now a burned-out husk.\nFor as long as anyone can remember, this has been a peaceful neighborhood.\n''We have Asian and white families living side by side here who are totally baffled,'' said Colin Dawber, 42, who owns a newspaper store. Its windows were smashed during the rampage. He said the nationalist party capitalized on two things: the area's economic privation and turf-related tensions between white and Asian gangs.\n''I don't believe people voted for the B.N.P. because deep down they believed in all its stated aims,'' Mr. Dawber said. ''People voted out of frustration with the general poverty in areas of the town. Tour around and see how economically deprived it is. It's just as bad as Los Angeles, parts of New Jersey.''\nThe violence has set race relations back considerably, he said. Four days after the rioting, all of Burnley's 342 taxis were off the road, with Asians saying they were afraid to go to work.\nDescribing the feelings of Asian residents he knows, Mr. Dawber said: ''People are feeling the pressure of having to take abuse from ignorant people. I have an Asian friend whose wife is Welsh, who was told to go back to where he came from. He said, 'But I don't want to go back to Southport,' '' a town west of Manchester.\nMr. Dawber blamed unruly thugs on both sides for the tensions. So did an elderly white couple across the street, although their sympathies lie with the whites. ''The Asians call us white bastards, and tell us to go back to our own country,'' said the woman, adding that she was afraid to give her name.\n''Live and let live, that's our motto,'' her husband said. But the Asians make it hard, he added, describing how he stands in line with other whites at the post office on Fridays, when welfare benefits, pension checks and the like arrive.\n''You see the Asians getting their money and putting it into registered letters and airmail envelopes,'' he said. ''We say to each other, 'Look at that lot, sending money back home.' They could get by on half the money they get on the dole.''\nHe and his wife said they were afraid to go into the heart of the Asian neighborhoods. It is easy to see why. Asked for a comment, a group of 20 or so Asian teenagers congregating in an all-Asian housing project several blocks away shouted, ''Jews!'' before making clear with a barrage of unprintable remarks about Jews, and reporters, that no visitors were welcome. A white police officer in a patrol car came out and stood pointedly nearby.\nAround the corner, Osama Yaqub, 20, a high school graduate in a traditional shalwar kameez -- a tunic over baggy trousers -- and a pair of running shoes, said it was youths who no longer respected their parents or their religion who were causing the trouble.\n''Muslims aren't supposed to drink or intoxicate themselves,'' Mr. Yaqub said, ''but look -- you have liquor stores all over the place, a drug dealer on every corner, rap music coming from windows.'' His contemporaries, he said, feel alienated from their roots, but they also feel alienated from whites.\nUp the hill in the Touch Wood furniture store, Mazer Iqbal, a second-generation Pakistani who rose from poverty to open his own business, only to see its windows smashed one recent weekend, said that he, too, felt little in common with the youths down the road.\nBut when the Pakistani national cricket team played the English team in Manchester several weeks ago, he found himself rooting for the Pakistanis.\nAnd he said he understood when the former Pakistani cricket star Imran Khan warned that the English team could not expect Asian support until England was prepared to support the Asians who now lived here.\n''Before this happened I thought I was British,'' he said. ''We have been in this country for a long time. But look at us: we have different skins, different religions. And now we've found out how unaccepted we are here.''","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"ab89b0b9-5773-4a50-86d5-e6f2578fcbbc","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:22:49.636+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"abe7f24c-fb74-4a47-8f47-3fe5149ee8b4","content":"The Angry Urban Refugees\n1998-05-10T05:00:00.000Z\nA CENTURY-OLD facade tumbles, tenants are roused from their beds, and reporters arrive to chronicle yet another faltering building in the city.\nEncouraged by relentlessly soggy weather, that scenario played out a dozen times in the last several months, from Madison Avenue, where a ton of bricks fell 39 stories, to Times Square, where the front of the Selwyn Theater collapsed under a cloud of dust.\nFor the residents of 172 Stanton Street on the Lower East Side, the trouble began just before 9 A.M. on Jan. 24, with a low rumble, followed by a loud crash. ''I heard something but didn't think much of it,'' recalled Paula Berson, 68, a book illustrator who lived on the third floor. ''I just went back to sleep. That is, until the firemen began pounding on the door.''\nAssured by city officials that their evacuation would be temporary, two dozen residents, wearing housecoats and sweat pants, left behind their money, their pets and a lifetime of possessions. They trudged out into the cold drizzle that Saturday morning and gazed up at their home, a five-story tenement, its face worn but seemingly whole. But out of sight, in the rear yard, sat a mound of bricks that, inspectors later told them, had peeled away from the first and second floors after torrential rains and years of neglect.\nAt 11 A.M., Mayor Giuliani toured the damaged building, his head unprotected by a hard hat. Mr. Giuliani's visit gave some comfort to the tenants, several of whom remembered the fate of a nearby building, 26 East First Street, six months earlier. After discovering rotted joists, the city lost no time in demolishing that structure, leaving two dozen people homeless.\n''In retrospect, we didn't really worry because it wasn't the first time our building had trouble,'' Mrs. Berson said. ''We figured they'd patch it up again and we'd be back in no time.''\nBy the next morning, though, their building, too, was gone. Ignoring the pleas of tenants and deeming it a danger to public safety, the city had ordered 172 Stanton Street torn down. It took 12 hours for a set of steel jaws to level the structure, which never fell on its own.\n''The building was hardly in danger of collapsing,'' said John Shuttleworth, an architect and local community board member who watched from behind police barricades. ''They literally had to tear the thing apart.''\nLocal elected officials and community activists condemned the city's rush to demolish, saying that the same building in a different neighborhood might have fared differently. ''If it had been at Park Avenue and 72d Street, you can be sure this building wouldn't have been torn down,'' Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed said.\nCity officials strongly defend the decision to raze 172 Stanton Street, saying that it was made after careful consideration. ''We only demolish buildings in extreme situations, when people's lives are in danger,'' said Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the Buildings Department, which issued the demolition order. ''We don't do these kinds of things for the fun of it.''\nBy Sunday morning the only hint that 10 families had once lived on the narrow wedge of land were paintings and posters that clung to a wall. On the sidewalk, a waterlogged heap of shattered furniture and soiled clothing was spread out for tenants to comb. The rest ended up in dump trucks owned by a private demolition company hired by the city.\nStill, some things did make it through the night. Marc Friedlander found his guitar, its neck snapped, and Amirum Ahmed recovered a mud-soaked sari. But Stanley and Ann Kleinkopf, residents since 1958, found nothing. ''We lost our wedding photos, our clothing and our beloved cat,'' Mr. Kleinkopf, 75, said, anguish scoring his face. ''I have nothing but the shirt on my back.''\nFour months since they lost their apartments, the former residents are still living fractured, uncertain lives. Only 3 of the 25 have found new homes; half remain in shelters and single-room-occupancy hotels. The others depend on the waning sympathies of friends or relatives. Mrs. Ahmed and her five children sleep on the living room floor of a friend's apartment. Francisco Oliver and his son share a one-bedroom apartment with three other relatives, and Milagro Muniz and her daughter shuffle among three different apartments ''so,'' she said, ''we don't burden anyone too much.''\nFor most tenants, depression and anguish have replaced shock, tears and for some, thoughts of suicide. But one emotion they all share is rage and bitterness. While most blame the landlords, Ruth and Nat Weisberg, for allowing the building to deteriorate, they are far angrier at the city, which they feel bulldozed their homes too hastily, then left them to fend for themselves.\n''It would be one thing if we had lost everything in a fire,'' said Mr. Friedlander, a film maker and musician whose entire body of work vanished with the building. ''But to know that the government took away your home makes it that much more painful.''\nTrying to Start A New Life at 75\nThere was little to distinguish 172 Stanton Street from the thousands of other weary tenements that fill the Lower East Side, New York's historic way station for millions of immigrants. The neighborhood is still richly layered with people from successive waves -- Jews, Chinese, Puerto Ricans and Bangladeshis -- and the artists, writers and musicians who came seeking the cheap rents that help them sustain their craft.\nThese days most newcomers are recent college graduates or self-styled pioneers seeking Manhattan's last slice of untamed bohemia. Gentrification has intensified, especially on the blocks just south of Houston Street, and the typical studio now starts at $1,000 a month. Scores of tenements mothballed since the Depression are being renovated and lounges that serve $7 cosmopolitans are starting to spread down old peddler streets like Orchard, Ludlow and Norfolk.\nStanley and Ann Kleinkopf are relics from that fabled pushcart era, when nearly one million Eastern European Jews crammed into the Lower East Side. The vast majority fled decades ago to places like Canarsie, Scarsdale and Great Neck, but the Kleinkopfs refused to budge. ''Back in the 50's we moved to Brooklyn for a month, but my wife hated it so much we came back,'' Mr. Kleinkopf said almost apologetically. ''What can I say? We like it here. We know everyone and everyone knows us.''\nThe Kleinkopfs lived in a half-dozen apartments in the neighborhood before settling at 172 Stanton in 1958. He did kitchen work in local luncheonettes; his wife stayed home to raise their daughter. For years he worked at Shaby's, a dairy restaurant on the ground floor of their building. When that closed in the late 70's, he went to Ratner's, another survivor from the old days.\nOn the morning of Jan. 24, Mr. Kleinkopf went out food shopping and came back to find his block awash in emergency vehicles and his wife sitting on the curb. ''You see these things on TV, but you never imagine it can happen to you,'' said Mrs. Kleinkopf, 71, who was so depressed by events that she was hospitalized for several weeks.\nThe Red Cross sent the couple to the Westway Motor Inn near La Guardia Airport and gave them a $250 coupon to buy clothing at Sears. Still, Mr. Kleinkopf says he was so dispirited, so overwhelmed that he wore the same clothes for two and a half months. ''I'm still like a chicken with its head cut off,'' he said. ''I'm trying to figure out how to start a new life at 75.''\nEverything they owned -- including $600 in nickels, dimes and quarters that Mr. Kleinkopf had saved -- is gone. But more painful, they say, was losing their cat, Honey, who presumably perished beneath the rubble. ''She was so good, so sweet,'' Mr. Kleinkopf said, sitting in his dimly lit motel room. ''She was like a piece of cake.''\nLike the other tenants who lost pets, he cannot understand why workers in the building that day did not rescue his cat. ''Was it so much trouble for them to grab her?'' he asked. ''It's just not human.''\nIn some ways, the Kleinkopfs are luckier than their neighbors. Last week they moved into subsidized housing on East Fifth Street that is run by the Jewish Association for Services to the Aged. Even though the rent, $245 a month, is nearly twice what they paid before, they are grateful for their new home. ''It's a good ending to a lousy story,'' Mr. Kleinkopf said.\nA Koran Vanishes. So Does $5,000.\nWhen the mechanical jaws took their first bite of her building, Muhibun Ahmed collapsed in tears. A few hours earlier, city officials had reassured residents they would be allowed to return to their homes. ''Until I saw them start, I could not believe they would actually tear down our building,'' said Muhibun, 17, who was taken to a nearby school by Red Cross workers.\nOnly her older brother Muhith, 20, stayed to watch. The Ahmeds' fifth-floor apartment was the first to go and Muhith still cannot shake the image of his Koran flying through the air. Just as painful was knowing that $5,000 in cash, the family's life savings, was stuffed under a mattress.\nThe Ahmed family understands sacrifice. When they moved from Bangladesh to New York in 1988, Mrs. Ahmed's husband gave up a teaching career and was forced to work as a security guard. ''It was more important for our children to get a good education,'' she said.\nIn 1991, her husband died from hepatitis B, and Mrs. Ahmed, unskilled and unable to speak English, went on public assistance. ''The last few years have been very hard,'' she said, her eyes filling with tears. ''But now they are unbearable.'' Since January, they have shared the home of fellow Bangladeshi immigrants, but the Ahmeds feel they have worn out their welcome. ''We are trying to find a place, but everything costs more than $1,200 a month,'' Muhibun said.\nUnable to bring guests to where they are staying, the family met a reporter at the Lotus Club, a recent addition to the neighborhood that is across from 172 Stanton Street. The women, dressed in traditional clothing, looked uncomfortable amid the downtown crowd sipping lattes and herbal tea. Eight-year-old Aktar nodded off on the shoulder of his mother, who stared blankly into the distance.\nThe stress has taken its toll on Muhibun, too, whose grades have begun to drop. ''I cry a lot and sometimes I yell at my little brothers for no reason,'' she said. Because Aktar has no toys, he is often bored and restless after school. And because there is no room in the apartment to play, his older brother and sister, Ashraf and Akhterun, spend much of their free time in a nearby park, unsupervised. ''I feel so helpless,'' Mrs. Ahmed said later, glancing at the empty lot. ''I'm afraid for my family.''\nLiving the Life Of a Nomad\nMarc Friedlander rushed into the Lotus Club an hour late and immediately spilled his coffee. As he wiped up the mess, his hands trembled. His face, with three days growth, revealed the strain of many sleepless nights. ''I can't describe what my life has been like,'' he said apologetically. ''I've been almost suicidal.''\nKnown on the local art scene as Mark Zero, Mr. Friedlander, 35, has earned considerable acclaim for his video montages of imagery he shot around the world. He is also an obsessive collector of others' photography: antique pornography, goose-stepping German soldiers and images from the Vietnam War. At the time 172 Stanton Street was torn down, he was editing his first feature, a documentary about teen-agers living in Tompkins Square Park. Since then he has been too distracted and addled to work, he says. Late last month, he and his girlfriend were evicted, illegally he claims, from the loft they occupied in Williamsburg. Now Mr. Friedlander has fallen into a nomadic existence, sleeping on sofas in friends' apartments. ''I can't afford to live in my old neighborhood,'' he said. ''I've thought of leaving New York, but I don't know where I would go.''\nMr. Friedlander has become the leader and unofficial spokesman for his former neighbors. Voluble, opinionated and unafraid of confrontation, he says he frequently clashed with his landlords over what he considered inadequate maintenance and shoddy repairs. ''They once tore out beautiful marble floors in the hallway and replaced them with rough concrete,'' he said. ''They were penny-wise and pound-foolish.''\nThe Weisbergs declined to talk about the building, but their lawyer, Daniel Marotta, disputed the accusation that they were neglectful. Over the last decade, he said, they have invested thousands of dollars rehabilitating 172 Stanton Street.\nOn the day the wall fell, Mr. Friedlander waited behind the barricades with his neighbors, confident the displacement would be temporary. But later that afternoon, after a city official told him that contractors would ''gently take apart'' the building to protect their possessions, he decided to act. Sneaking past the barricades, he slipped into the darkened building with a flashlight. ''It was so eerie inside because they had cut the electricity,'' he recalled, ''and all the doors had been pried open by the Fire Department. Otherwise the building looked fine to me.''\nHe said he was frantically stuffing cameras and video tapes into a bag when a test blow from the crane shook the walls. ''My heart was beating out of my chest,'' he said. ''I decided it was more important to live than to get more stuff.'' He opened a window and waved to the cordon of incredulous police officers on the street, several of whom rushed upstairs. Within minutes, he was in handcuffs. As they escorted him to the station house, one officer, he said, quietly told him, ''I don't blame you for what you did.'' Three hours later, after being charged with disorderly conduct, he was released and made his way back to the barricades, where a large crowd was chanting, ''Give us 15 minutes.''\nWith the help of neighborhood advocates, the tenants had delivered a petition to a State Supreme Court justice, asking for a temporary restraining order. But before they got a response, demolition began.\nA Refrigerator, a TV But No Bathtub\nPaula Berson had no idea how addicted she was to her bathtub until she could no longer use it. ''I don't feel right unless I take a bath everyday,'' said Mrs. Berson, who has been living in an S.R.O. on West 97th Street for the last four months. Because of numerous health problems, among them pernicious anemia and a degenerative neurological disorder, she loses her balance easily and cannot stand in the shower without assistance. Now, she bathes in the tub of a nearby friend several times a week.\n''It's depressing not being able to take a bath every day,'' she said, sitting in her closet-sized room, its only window overlooking a noise-filled air shaft. Besides a cot, the room holds only a small refrigerator, a television set and a dresser. ''There's nothing to put in here except me,'' she said, smiling weakly and grinding a cigarette into a saucer overflowing with the day's butts.\nA soft-spoken woman, Mrs. Berson has no complaints about her quarters and is especially appreciative that the shelter's staff provides her with fresh linens once a week. She also bears no grudge against her former landlord, who she said ''had no reason to want the building destroyed.'' But she has plenty of anger toward the city, which she says could have tried much harder to save her and her husband's life work. ''I guess they figured we were poor and had nothing,'' she said. ''Well, they were wrong.''\nNow, her days are spent waiting to hear from the Housing Authority about an apartment, hopefully in her old neighborhood. ''I don't think I could live anywhere else,'' said Mrs. Berson, who has no children and no relatives. ''I really don't like the Upper West Side, where everyone is so busy making money and making babies.''\nThe low roof lines and low rents drew the Bersons to Stanton Street in 1963, she said. They paid just $151 a month for their four-room apartment, and often traveled to places like Morocco and Greece where they would sketch for months at a time. Mr. Berson, who died a decade ago, was a prolific illustrator and the author of more than 100 children's books. Mrs. Berson produced seven books as well as countless paintings.\n''Our apartment was stuffed to the gills with goodies: antiques, drawings and thousands of art books,'' she said. ''But all of that is gone.'' The only thing she grabbed before leaving home that morning, her pocketbook, was nearly empty. She kept it that way, she said, to minimize losses if she was mugged.\nHaving no identification, no photographs from her past, is especially disorienting. And having no evidence of her work leaves her feeling as if she never existed. ''It would have been better if my paintings had been stolen,'' she said. ''At least that way, I'd know they still existed.''\nAfter the Fall, the Lawsuits\nDID 172 Stanton Street have to come down?\nBecause of pending litigation against the city, neither the Buildings Department nor the Department of Housing Preservation and Development would explain their decision to demolish the building or why it was not at least temporarily shored up.\nIn the emergency declaration report he wrote for 172 Stanton Street at the time of the demolition, Thomas O'Flaherty, the buildings department's chief inspector, noted a series of cracks on the building's front facade and wrote that the rest of the rear wall was ''in imminent danger of collapse.''\nBut Frederick Goldberg, an architect hired by the landlord in 1996 to stabilize the facade, says he believes that the crumbled rear wall did not threaten the entire structure. ''Things can be fixed,'' he said. ''In my opinion, that building should still be here today.''\nThe city did not allow an independent examination of the affected area that day, but John Shuttleworth, a local architect who examined photographs of the damage, says he believes it could have been easily repaired. Two of the building's walls, he noted, abutted adjacent structures and the recently installed tie rods and turnbuckles appeared to be holding the floors and walls in place. ''I think there was a rush to judgment by the city,'' he said.\nReached at their Judaica store on Essex Street, the landlords, Ruth and Nat Weisberg, declined to comment. But their lawyer, Daniel Marotta, said his clients had spent tens of thousands of dollars on repairs since they bought the building in 1985. ''Now all they've left with is an empty lot, a lawsuit, no rents, and a cleanup bill from the city,'' Mr. Marotta said.\nThe company that took down the building, the N.B.I. Equipment Corporation, was paid $300,000, which will be billed to the Weisbergs. The city could not say where the wreckage of 172 Stanton Street ended up, nor did it provide a phone number for N.B.I Equipment, which is not listed in telephone directories. Even though the contract called for demolition by hand and machine, 172 Stanton was brought down almost entirely by machine.\nThe tenants have filed a $34 million lawsuit against the Weisbergs and the city. The suit accuses the Weisbergs of failing to maintain the building, and the city of violating their constitutional right to due process by destroying their homes without a hearing. A lawyer for the tenants, Alan L. Fuchsberg, says that the city ignored its own procedures when it ordered the building quickly razed because a request to take down even the most perilous structures must be reviewed by a judge.\nBut a lawyer for the city, Gabriel Taussig, disagreed, saying that exceptions were allowed in emergencies: ''Clearly, when a wall is about to fall on somebody's head, the city can exercise its police powers and take immediate action.''

Official Who Is, er, a Woman\n1998-04-02T05:00:00.000Z\nConfronted with growing hostility in Afghanistan, the United Nations told the radical Islamic movement Taliban today that unless harassment of international officials stops and more attention is paid to the rights of women, the organization could sharply reduce its assistance. This is the only substantial aid flowing into this country, one of the world's poorest and least developed.\nThe message was delivered by Carol Bellamy, executive director of Unicef and one of the highest ranking Americans in the United Nations system. Her arrival here today, after meetings in Geneva over the weekend with Secretary General Kofi Annan, sent another message: that a woman has the power to affect Afghanistan's national development and cannot be ignored.\nToday for the first time the No. 2 man in the Taliban hierarchy, the Acting President, Mullah Mohammed Rabanni, agreed to meet a foreign woman publicly.\nThe movement's chief of protocol, Dr. Abdul Sattar Paktiss, then entertained Ms. Bellamy and other United Nations officials at a relatively lavish lunch, complete with white linen and an abundant floral centerpiece laid out under bullet-riddled picture windows at the skeletal Kabul Inter-Continental Hotel. Ms. Bellamy spent the day dressed conservatively in slacks, a long-sleeved sweater, a raincoat and a headscarf.\nIn recent months, as fissures in the Taliban seemed to be widening, Afghan officials in some regions have stepped up a campaign of harassing United Nations staff members with unexplained searches, threats and generally confrontational behavior\nThe incidents culminated last month in an assault on a United Nations worker in Kandahar by the regional Taliban governor, who was apparently annoyed that money for flood relief had not been delivered. The United Nations withdrew all its staff from Kandahar, the religious headquarters of the Taliban.\nThe United Nations is studying a general cutback to only ''life saving'' activities, which could gut already modest programs in health, narcotics control and other areas. Unicef's education projects are on hold because girls are denied equal access to schooling.\nMore worrying in the long term than isolated acts of violence, Ms. Bellamy told the Taliban today, was the edict issued recently forbidding Muslim women from working and traveling in Afghanistan without a husband or other close male relative.\nInternational aid workers see that as an attempt to curtail the influence of women from more moderate Muslim countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh or Turkey. United Nations officials had welcomed such women's involvement in Afghanistan, seeing them as a cultural bridge. The edict effectively bars them from working.\nThe Taliban leadership continues to bar girls from education beyond primary school, citing a lack of buildings and safety concerns. Many girls are enrolled in often-secret home schools run by teachers who became unemployed when the movement sharply limited the right of women to work outside the home.\nAt the same time, in the absence of foreign aid from traditional sources, the Taliban leadership has become increasingly demanding of United Nations attention and money. The Taliban controls more than three-quarters of Afghanistan but has almost no international recognition because of its human rights record. Its politically inexperienced religious fighters, drawn from Islamic schools, have not developed economic policies for lifting the war-ravaged country out of extreme poverty.\n''Our country needs support,'' Dr. Paktiss, the chief of protocol, said before meeting Ms. Bellamy, whom he welcomed as ''an honored guest.'' He added that he asked only that Islamic culture be respected.\nMr. Rabanni, the Acting President, told Ms. Bellamy, ''Everything is negotiable,'' adding that the edict on women's work and travel was being reviewed.\nAfghan and United Nations officials say the edict was apparently issued by extreme conservatives in Kandahar without the knowledge of less radical officials in Kabul.\nMs. Bellamy said Afghan culture would not be ignored, but that this was not an excuse for unacceptable behavior.\n''The United Nations works in more than 180 countries around the world, in many different cultures, in many different environments,'' she said. ''But there are basic principles that are followed. We respect different cultures. But there is a level of response that will be necessary.\n''We want to work with the authorities to improve conditions for the people of Afghanistan.

The meeting is a litmus test of whether globalization can be managed to close the increasingly obscene wealth gap separating rich and poor countries.\nUnfortunately, the conference has all the makings of yet another high-cost, low-output talk shop, with Northern governments offering empty promises in place of the real policy reforms that are needed.\nMembership of the LDCs is dominated by countries in sub-Saharan Africa but extends across the world from Haiti to Bangladesh and Cambodia. Poverty is endemic. Almost half of the people live on less than $1 a day. Life expectancy is 25 years less than in the industrialized countries.\nTwenty years ago the ratio of average income in the LDCs to income in the rich world was 1-to-87. Now it is 1-to-98.\nTen years ago, at the last UN conference on LDCs, industrialized countries promised decisive action to break the vicious circle of slow growth and rising poverty. Improved market access, more aid and debt relief were to be the building blocks of a new deal. Since then they have delivered nothing except more empty promises.\nTake the case of trade. Governments in the United States and Europe make much of the market preferences provided to LDCs in the form of lower tariff barriers. Yet these preferences are conspicuous by their absence in sectors, such as textiles and agriculture, where these countries are best placed to expand exports.\nAccording to the World Bank, tariffs and quotas applied in rich countries cost LDCs about $2.5 billion annually in lost foreign exchange earnings. The United States, one of the worst offenders, accounts for almost half of this total, mainly because of restrictions on textile imports. For every $1 provided to Bangladesh in aid, the United States takes away $7 through import barriers.\nEurope offers more generous market access than the United States, but it has little else to be proud of. Pascal Lamy, the European Union's commissioner for trade, broke the mold by proposing that LDCs be given unrestricted market access for all nonmilitary exports.\n\"Everything but Arms,\" as the proposal was dubbed, was swiftly attacked by the familiar coalition of farm lobbies and agribusiness interests, who succeeded in removing commodities such as sugar, rice and beef from the liberalization commitments. The supine response of some European governments has sent the clear signal that powerful vested interests come before the interests of the world's poorest people.\nOne area of trade policy in which rich countries have been more generous is in the provision of bad advice, provided under the auspices of the IMF and the World Bank. While industrial countries have kept the doors to their markets shut, many LDCs have been required under the terms of structural adjustment programs to liberalize their markets at breakneck speed, often with disastrous consequences.\nNowhere are the double standards more painfully apparent than in agriculture. Rich countries continue to subsidize their agricultural sectors to the tune of $1 billion a day, flooding world markets with cheap grains. And while the North subsidizes with impunity, poor countries have been opening up their markets under IMF-World Bank instructions. In Haiti, the liberalization of rice markets and an ensuing surge in imports from the United States has destroyed thousands of rural livelihoods, undermining national food self-reliance in the process.\nThe record on aid is even more depressing than on trade. Having been promised more aid, LDCs have seen development assistance cut by more than $3 billion since 1990 — a cut of one-third in real terms.\nIt goes without saying that higher growth and poverty reduction will depend on actions undertaken by LDC governments. But without supportive action at an international level there is a real danger that these countries will become increasingly isolated islands of poverty, despair and instability.\nThe writer, senior policy adviser to Oxfam, contributed this comment to the International Herald Tribune.\n[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"ae8e8285-8271-4412-ae29-1ea9918e2c7a","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:36:42.341+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"b1829586-9752-4081-9c7a-59b3495de1e5","content":"World Briefing\n2001-06-09T05:00:00.000Z\n AFRICA \n ZIMBABWE: MUGABE VOWS MORE LAND SEIZURES \n President Robert Mugabe vowed yesterday to press on with land seizures from white farmers and urged supporters to rally round his government.

But no problem in a century and a half of statehood can quite compare to the electricity crisis gripping the Golden State.\nAs California endures its ninth straight day of an official power emergency with no easy end in sight, things have come to this: the 35 million residents of the nation's most populous state and the world's seventh largest economy are being urged to watch the Super Bowl in groups to avoid rolling blackouts at the hours of peak demand.\nThe truth has dawned only gradually that California, the epicenter of the nation's booming high tech economy, is subject to the episodic daily failure of a vital piece of its modern infrastructure that would not seem surprising in Bangladesh but still feels mostly surreal here.\n''It's not just an economic story,'' said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and author of a series of histories of the California experience, who said that even the devastating San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906 was not so daunting.\n''It's a cultural and imaginative story,'' Mr. Starr said. ''Once again, Californians have to be alerted to the fact that they have to earn California, that it doesn't come for free. Massachusetts knows that. New York knows that. Any place where it snows knows that. Californians have to learn that again and again.''\nThis was not supposed to be the time for that lesson. A decade after a brutal recession and a series of natural disasters that felt like Biblical plagues, California has been on a roll, with a $5 billion surplus in state coffers, record low unemployment, resurgent optimism and predictions of phenomenal growth. The state's economy grew at 6 percent last year, 1.5 percentage points above the national economy, and pronouncements that the California Dream was dead gave way to warnings that the challenge of the new century would be managing plenty.\nIn fact, it is growth, at least in part, that has fueled the current crisis. Demand for electricity outpaced older power plants, while a botched experiment with partial price deregulation and longstanding environmental opposition combined to create disincentives to build new power plants or create cheaper wholesale prices through competition. Instead, wholesale electricity prices have spiraled out of control, pushing the state's two major private utilities, which have been barred from raising retail rates, to the brink of bankruptcy.\n''You have a first-world economy that's suddenly been plunged into a third-world economic environment,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. ''There were some early warning signs, but we were probably too busy reading our own press clippings to pay attention.''\nIndeed, though it powers everything from the marquees of Hollywood to the factories and Internet servers of Silicon Valley, electricity itself is so invisible as to be taken for granted. Unlike water, which has historically been thought of as the state's essential resource, it cannot be stored in underground aquifers or behind dams, but must be generated and distributed constantly.\nThe state's two largest utilities, Southern California Edison and the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, saddled with debt, have been shut out of making long-term purchases at the most favorable prices, and instead have had to scramble on the spot market. In just six days, the state has run through about one-third of the $400 million it set aside on emergency basis last week to buy power and pass it on to the utilities. And though the Bush administration extended a federal order requiring power producers to sell surplus electricity and natural gas to California, that reprieve is set to expire in two weeks.\nThough there have not been long-lasting nighttime blackouts, public patience is wearing thin. A recent statewide Field Poll found that the proportion of Californians who think the state is headed in the right direction has dropped from its average of nearly 6 in 10 voters last year to just over 4 in 10 now. Another survey, by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, found that as many Californians -- fully one-quarter of adults statewide -- cite electricity prices and deregulation as the No. 1 issue facing the state as cite public schools and education, long the paramount concern here. In past surveys, electricity had not even surfaced.\n''It's a problem that's come out of nowhere and it's put all the other issues in the state on hold for now,'' said Mark Baldassare, the institute's survey director. ''It has already shown signs of draining much of the rest of our viable resources, the terrific surpluses that we were looking to as a source of solving problems from a lack of roads and infrastructure to new schools and education.''\n''Here we are in the heart of the new economy,'' Mr. Baldassare added, ''and we're spending our money furiously just to keep the lights on. It seems as if everything we learn about this, the fixes are more and more complicated.''\nNo one will bear the brunt of those complications more than Gov. Gray Davis, the placid Democratic centrist who has presided over boom times with high approval ratings since taking office two years ago, but who had yet to be tested in a crunch. In the current crisis, Mr. Davis has been criticized in many quarters as moving too slowly and has vowed to oppose electricity rate increases at virtually all costs, a goal some other prominent politicians consider unrealistic, since higher rates would help force conservation. The State Legislature, which approved the deregulation plan four years ago, has struggled with potential solutions, including having the state take over the hydroelectric plants or transmission systems, but no consensus has emerged.\n''I'd been saying this is the worst crisis a governor had faced since the Medfly, but that doesn't do it justice anymore,'' said Dan Schnur, a longtime aide to former Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican who was in office when deregulation was approved. ''This is going to sound partisan, but it's just unflattering analysis: Davis has never had to make an unpopular decision. He came in during a period of extraordinary economic growth, where the government's biggest problem was how to divide up its surplus, and now he's in a situation where there are no palatable options available and he's having huge difficulty.''\nMr. Davis has insisted that his deliberate approach will bear fruit, and has refused to accept what could be the quick but politically explosive step of raising retail electric rates in a state with a strong tradition of consumer activism and anti-tax sentiment. The Field Poll found that nearly 6 in 10 Californians believe the crisis is more an effort by energy companies to force higher rates than a shortage resulting from increased demand and not enough power generation. Most political experts predict that next year's statewide ballot, when Mr. Davis is running for re-election, is apt to be studded with proposals for handling electricity rates and supplies, any one of which could prompt heavy spending by competing groups and roil the political waters.\nOne of the oddities of the crisis is that Los Angeles, the state's largest city and its most economically and culturally dominant one, has been largely immune, since its municipal utility, the Department of Water and Power, was not subject to deregulation, has its own sources of generation and has sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of surplus electricity for use in other parts of the state. But soon enough, experts predict, it will feel the cost of the power crisis as state revenues that might have gone to repair roads or build new schools are diverted to buy electricity.\nIn the longer term, Mr. Starr, the historian, said: ''Anybody who wants to put money on California going under is going to lose that money. Because it'll come back. It always does. Right now, it's like an adolescent that just spurted up by a foot and a half. But it'll adjust.''","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"b3fea470-193d-4c06-9193-fce35fd7f99c","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:37:30.14+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"b514fb90-30c2-49a6-adf4-53efa4390f9f","content":"Rescue work slow as toll in Bangladesh cyclone nears 1,900\n2007-11-18T05:00:00.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh — Rescuers fought their way through blocked roads as thousands of cyclone survivors awaited relief aid on Sunday amid their wrecked homes and flooded fields, while the storm's death toll neared 1,900.\nThe government deployed military helicopters, naval ships and thousands of troops to join international agencies and local officials in the rescue mission following the tropical cyclone designated Sidr.\nRescuers struggled to clear roads and get their vehicles through, but many found the blockages impassable.\nAt least 1.5 million coastal villagers had fled to shelters where they were given emergency rations, a senior government official, Ali Imam Majumder, said in Dhaka.\nThe official death toll stood at 1,861, but the authorities feared that the figure could rise as more rescuers reach ravaged areas.\n\"We have seen more bodies floating in the sea,\" a fisherman from the southwest, Zakir Hossain, said after reaching shore with two decomposing bodies he and other fishermen had found on their way.\nThe worst-hit area was the Bagerhat District, where 610 people died, said Ashraful Zaman, an official at a cyclone monitoring center in Dhaka.\nThe cyclone's 240 kilometer-per-hour, or 150 mile-per-hour, winds smashed tens of thousands of homes Thursday in southwestern Bangladesh and ruined much-needed crops just before the harvest season.

Thousands of Britons work in New York, many of them in the financial industry. The British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said Thursday that almost 100 Britons had been confirmed killed in the tragedy. \n For Israel, the disaster was almost a hometown story, with as many as 250,000 Israeli nationals living in the New York area. Two Israelis who were on the hijacked airliners are known to have died, but dozens more are feared missing in the trade center. A special situation room at the Foreign Ministry has received more than 4,000 requests since the catastrophe. \n More than 40,000 people worked in the center. At least 4,700 were listed as missing, including hundreds of firefighters and policemen, but hopes were fading that many more would be found alive. \n More than 400 people were still being treated at St. Vincent's hospital in Manhattan. \n With about 44 million people of Irish ancestry in America, the attacks were also a national tragedy for Ireland. On board the United Airlines flight from Boston that slammed into the center's south tower were an Irish mother of 45 and her four-year old daughter. \n The plane hit the tower just as the woman's brother, Ronnie Clifford, 47, was escaping from the building. \"He's very traumatized,\" their brother, John Clifford, said in Cork, Ireland. Meanwhile, the Irish government was seeking to trace scores of its nationals who are still missing. \n Many financial businesses that have a strong presence on both sides of the Atlantic were in the twin towers of the trade center and the surrounding district. \n The financial services group Cantor Fitzgerald was one of those affected, with hundreds of staff members on the top floors of one of the towers. The British insurer Royal Sun and Alliance also issued a statement that staff members were still unaccounted for. \n Morgan Stanley; the investment banks Sandler O'Neill, Keefe Bruyette Woods and Thomson Financial; and the brokerage firm ICAP were also among companies with international staffs in the region. Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank said all their staff members were accounted for and safe. \n The British government pledged Thursday to cover medical costs for any Britons caught up in attacks who did not have insurance. \n More than 20,000 names were listed on a World Trade Center survivor database Web site: http://wtc.ny.com. The list was being updated every 15 minutes. \n The Battery Park City Authority also set up a message board to help people locate friends and relatives, at http://members2.boardhost.com/batteryparkcity/index.html. \n Asian businesses also employed large numbers of local and expatriate staff in the stricken building. In Tokyo, a Foreign Ministry official said at least 100 of its nationals were unaccounted for, including 20 who worked in the trade center and two on the aircraft. \n Twelve of the 125 Japanese staff members of the Fuji Bank were among the missing, along with about 50 of the 500 locally hired workers. Thirty-one Japanese banks, securities firms and insurance companies had offices in the twin towers, with hundreds of national employees and more than 1,000 local hires. \n It was not known how many foreigners at the time of the attacks were on the observation deck on top of one of the towers. The Australian swimming star Ian Thorpe turned back from a visit to the deck to pick up a camera at his hotel, but three other Australians were reported among the dead and about 90 were unaccounted for. \"We have little doubt that we will need to brace ourselves for more\" fatalities, said the Australian defense minister, Peter Reith. \n The Foreign Ministry in Taipei said it was concerned for nine missing Taiwanese citizens. More than a score of South Koreans also were among the missing. The caretaker leader of Bangladesh, Latifur Rahman, said it was feared at least 50 of his co-nationals had died.

The Syrians would replace Bangladesh in a seat that is alternated among nations in the General Assembly's Asian regional bloc, which includes the Middle East.\nVoting by the General Assembly for five of the 10 nonpermanent Security Council members will be in the fall to fill seats for 2002-2003. But nations aspiring to hold the places begin campaigns early, sometimes years in advance, because the process often involves extensive of political horsetrading.\nSyria's effort, which Israel opposes, has the backing of a majority of Middle Eastern and Asian nations and several important European governments, including France and Germany, according to diplomats. The Bush administration -- still in transition and without an ambassador here until the Senate confirms its nominee, John Negroponte -- has not made a statement on Syria's candidacy and is still studying the issue.\n''Since this vote will not occur until well into the fall's General Assembly, it is simply too early to go into any additional detail on the U.S. position on any Security Council candidacy,'' said Paul Aronsohn, a spokesman for the United States mission.\nWhen Secretary of State Colin L. Powell visited the Middle East, he met President Bashir al-Assad of Syria, who surprised diplomats by offering to place oil purchases from Iraq under United Nations supervision. Iraq had expected to reopen a pipeline to Syria outside the United Nations ''oil for food'' program.\nSome diplomats here speculate that General Powell may have discussed Syria's candidacy for a Security Council seat while in Damascus and may be prepared not to oppose it. For years many nations turned a cold shoulder toward Syria, contending it had a shadowy reputation on terrorism, an intransigent attitude toward peace with Israel, and dominated its neighbor, Lebanon.\nThe Clinton administration fought a similar effort last year when Sudan tried to take an African seat. The United States and several African nations mounted a campaign against Sudan, and the Sudanese lost out.\nIsrael's ambassador to the United Nations, Yehuda Lancry, said in an interview today that although all regional groups have the right to choose any country for a Council seat, he questions whether Syria meets the criteria set down in the United Nations Charter.\nMr. Lancry gave this quote from Article 23: ''The General Assembly shall elect 10 other members of the United Nations to be nonpermanent members of the Security Council, due regard being specially paid, in the first instance, to the contribution of members of the United Nations to the maintenance of international peace and security.''\n''Here I have to stress the sad fact,'' Mr. Lancry said, ''the fact that my colleagues from Lebanon can't unfortunately portray -- that Syria is an occupying power in Lebanon. Syria does not contribute to the maintenance of peace and security.\n''Moreover, Syria feeds the lack of stability and security and peace on the Israeli-Lebanese border, using the Hezbollah movement as the tool for this destabilization. That is why we consider that this candidacy is in blatant contradiction with the spirit and the letter of this article.''","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"bb97cc5c-e17e-470a-a6eb-84ea2549cfe8","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:51:51.124+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"bcbaca79-0f28-43fd-a3df-7cfb40521e64","content":"Testing Bangladesh’s Waters","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[{"tagged_token_id":"2e0cf7e9-4916-467d-bb0c-6c99a984eb58","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"bcbaca79-0f28-43fd-a3df-7cfb40521e64","start":24,"end":25,"tag":"Flood type","tag_id":"6de6f201-e6f3-46be-845f-21a8d8190680","value":"e","correct":false,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:51:57.932+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"bcbaca79-0f28-43fd-a3df-7cfb40521e64","classname":"Bangladesh","class_id":"d89a6030-48e2-44b1-86d4-e64cfe3abb59","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:52:28.108+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"be69714d-e8dc-4244-83d8-491b4280c7e3","content":"THE BLIZZARD OF 2000: THE AIRPORTS; For Travelers, the Misery Endures\n2001-01-01T05:00:00.000Z\nOf all the thousands of people at La Guardia Airport whose travel plans collapsed this weekend beneath the Blizzard of 2000, consider the plight of Sheikh Kabir, 30, a mild-mannered database manager scheduled to be married this week on the other side of the world.\nOn Saturday, when Mr. Kabir tried to fly from his home in Annandale, Va., to catch a connecting flight to his native Bangladesh, the storm grounded his plane. He tried to get another flight, and the blizzard scuttled that one, too. Finally, Mr. Kabir caught a train, slept on a bench in Penn Station in Manhattan and made his way through the snowy streets to the ticket counter at La Guardia, where he waited early yesterday with hundreds of other marooned passengers for an uncertain deliverance.\n''My marriage is on the line,'' said a red-eyed Mr. Kabir, whose wedding to a woman he has yet to meet is set for Thursday. ''I didn't think this sort of thing happened in America. Bangladesh, yes. But America? I moved here to avoid this sort of thing.''\nThe season's great storm has departed, but along with its blackening snow, it left behind airports filled with broken plans, stranded voyagers and a tangle of vouchers, reroutes, delays and cancellations.\nThe metropolitan area's three major airports -- La Guardia, J.F.K. and Newark -- all reopened late Saturday and early yesterday after the storm had shut them down. The heavy snow and the holiday traffic combined to turn the airports, where air travel is hardly stress free on the best of days, into crowded, noisy corridors of waiting and rescheduling.\nSprawled across floors and over benches and under TV monitors were hundreds of bleary-eyed travelers searching for a way home. They slept on cots, on tile floors and on luggage carousels, as motionless as the planes outside. When the sun rose, would-be passengers rushed to the ticket counters for fresh news of any newly materialized flights. Some found it; others did not.\n''There was a huge crowd when I got here this morning at 4 a.m.,'' said Barbara Antoni, who works at the information desk of American Airlines. ''When I walked up to the counter, everyone started cheering.''\nLa Guardia was closed for about 13 hours Saturday, prompting the cancellation of about 800 flights and the grounding of some 40,000 fliers, officials said. But aside from a lucky pair of flights that landed and left late Saturday night, La Guardia's runways were vacant until early yesterday morning -- nearly 20 hours. By early afternoon yesterday, 70 more flights had been canceled. Some passengers were still adjusting their pillows.\n''I'm having a bad moment,'' said Loraine Krol, embracing her 14-year-old daughter, Carrie, and beginning to cry. ''I've done so well until now. I was just starting to feel sorry for myself.''\nLike dozens of others marooned at La Guardia, the three members of the Krol family arrived early Saturday just as the storm was hitting its stride. The Krols were returning in a rented car from a holiday in western Massachusetts, en route to their home in Arvida, Colo. Some 30 hours after they arrived, Ronald Krol lay on one of the army-style cots Port Authority workers doled out the night before.\nMs. Krol propped her pillow against the window and settled down. Just outside, a worker blasted the ice from an airplane wing. ''With luck, we'll be home tonight,'' she said.\nDespite the complaints, La Guardia officials said they were pleased with their response to the blizzard, which dropped as much as two inches of snow per hour on the airport's 25 miles of runways and roads. As the storm approached, workers stood at the ready with 500 tons of sand, 500 tons of salt, 18,000 gallons of anti-icing liquid and 18 pieces of snow removal equipment, including plows, blowers and sweepers.\nStill, it was not enough. The snow fell so fast, officials said, that by the time a plow reached the end of a runway, the snow had already begun to pile up at the other end.\n''The snow was coming down faster than you could keep up with,'' said Warren Kroeppel, La Guardia's general manager.\nHolly Arthur, a spokeswoman for the American Association of Airport Executives, said that the time needed to clear a quantity of snow equal to the amount that fell on La Guardia -- about 13 inches -- depended on an array of factors, including the rate the snow came down, the wind speed and the size of the runways.\n''It totally depends on the conditions,'' Ms. Arthur said.\nDuring much of the day, airport officials said, planes were landing and taking off from only one of La Guardia's two runways. By last night, both had been cleared.\nFor all their frustration, many of La Guardia's grounded passengers bore their discomfort with good cheer. A group of second-grade teachers from Greenville, Wisc., who had come to New York for a two-day holiday, ended up spending nearly as much time in La Guardia as in the city itself. With matted hair and fading smiles, they chatted about the things they would do when they finally returned home.\n''We are all going to take bubble baths,'' said Mary Fischer, who passed more 26 hours in the airport with her friends.\nMichael Tooley was more prepared than most to be philosophical about his delay. After more than 30 hours at La Guardia, Mr. Tooley, a professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado, sat with a fellow devotee and discussed such high concepts as time travel, the nature of properties and backwards causation.\n''Just passing the time,'' he said.\nAs the day wore on, the most nagging worry for many passengers became whether or not they would make it home ahead of the New Year. Several passengers said they had already called home to cancel parties, dinners and dates.\nNot Vito Bianco, a retired New York printing worker on his way to Cape Coral, Fla. A widower, Mr. Bianco said there were many opportunities for a single man like himself, and that the woman he was hoping to see New Year's Eve would bear his absence with patience and understanding.\n''She'll wait for me forever,'' he said.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"be69714d-e8dc-4244-83d8-491b4280c7e3","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:52:37.268+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"c1de92f5-4888-40be-9f97-465fbb44818a","content":"Hard Cash in Siberia : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\n1998-10-27T05:00:00.000Z\nRegarding \"Economic Slump Imperils Life in Siberia\" (Oct. 22):\nThe article on an impending food and fuel crisis in northeastern Siberia practically winks at the virtual hijacking of an unpaid-for shipment of food supplies by the regional governor.\nIt does not mention whether the region is continuing its extraction of gold and diamonds and, if so, where the (hard-currency?) revenue for the production goes.

At crucial stages of brain development, this generation's physical and mental abilities will not develop normally and can never rebound.\nSeparately, international medical workers from groups like the Red Cross have begun to document how the effects of food shortages are being severely compounded by a breakdown in public health services. Even basic water purification systems stand idle for lack of essential ingredients like chlorine, Red Cross workers say, leaving vast numbers of people with such severe diarrhea that they are unable to absorb completely what little food they have.\nRecently, an increasingly clear and saddening picture of the hungry life of North Korea's 23 million people has come into focus, as the Government has slowly, sometimes begrudgingly, granted increased access to international aid groups, leading to the recent formal study as well as more informal surveys and observations by foreign aid agencies. Past assessments of the magnitude of the disaster are considered flawed because they were based on interviews with a small number of North Korean refugees who had fled into China.\nAnd while the researchers and aid workers on the ground in North Korea have not seen evidence of cannibalism or starving children dying by the roadside, as has been described in the more lurid refugee reports, what they did find was in many ways equally disturbing: a population withering after nearly a decade of chronic hunger, people so weakened by malnutrition that colds and stomach flus quickly turn lethal, the future of a generation irretrievably lost.\n''Now at last we have hard facts -- the situation is very grave,'' said Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director for Asia of the United Nations World Food Program, which has taken part in the research. ''To me this is a famine in slow motion. People cope year after year, and probably a lot drop off. But the totality is very hard to gauge.''\nProviding the most solid data on the crisis to date, research teams led by foreign scientists fanned out across North Korea for three weeks this fall to conduct the first random sample nutritional survey, looking at 1,800 children. They found that 62 percent of children under 7 had stunted growth, a symptom of long-term malnutrition. Thirty percent of children between 1 and 2 suffered from moderate to severe malnutrition. This has a high likelihood of impairing mental and physical development, because the nervous system matures dramatically during this essential first year.\nThe researchers said available scientific data suggested that 10 years ago, malnutrition was rare in North Korea.\n''Even if the situation improves, it is unlikely to improve to the degree that the country will fully recover from what we saw,'' said Judit Katona-Apte, a senior program adviser for the United Nations World Food Program. ''People will be small and not as well developed as otherwise and somewhat limited in their mental capacities.''\nLikewise, when Red Cross representatives this year tested the water supply at the 840 hospitals and clinics where they operate, they found that not one had water suitable for human consumption, said Sten Swedlund, head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies' delegation in North Korea.\nPremature Deaths Put at Over a Million\n''But of course they drink it -- they have no choice,'' he said during a recent trip to Beijing. ''There is a very close relationship between the problems caused by the lack of food and a health sector that's in very bad shape.'' Virtually all the children under 7 who are malnourished also have diarrhea, he said.\nNot one of the aid groups has been able to study the issue of hunger-related deaths, and the North Koreans have not released relevant figures, although most experts agree that probably more than one million and perhaps as many as three million have died prematurely since the food shortages began. But public health experts say the number who have perished might be difficult to tally in any case, because most deaths were probably not from quick starvation, but from immune systems weakened by years of hunger, so that common colds more easily give way to lethal pneumonia and an ordinary bout of infectious diarrhea proves fatal.\nStill, there are some disturbing clues: The World Food Program and other groups last year conducted one limited study of 4,000 children hand-picked by the Government, and found 10 percent had a parent who was dead.\nIn this fall's independent nutritional survey, 18 teams of experts sent to eight of North Korea's nine provinces looked at 1,800 rural and urban children under 7. In addition to finding that 62 percent of children had stunted growth, the teams found that about 16 percent of children were suffering from acute malnutrition and were underweight for their height, a sign that they were severely underfed at the time of the study.\nThe Whole Country Seems to Be Underfed\nThat figure is higher than in any country in East Asia and puts North Korea among the world's worst 10 countries in terms of malnutrition. While that 16 percent figure is not quite as bad as those of India and Bangladesh -- the worst in the world with an 18 percent rate -- experts say North Korea's number in some ways understates the problem. In India and Bangladesh, pockets of severe poverty alternate with pockets of relative plenty, while in North Korea the whole country is to some degree underfed.\n''Even in war-torn countries, famine is more in pockets,'' Dr. Katona-Apte said. ''It's hard to think of another country that's been affected in this way.''\nThe survey results are especially sobering since the researchers studied only children under 7, the group that received nearly all the food donated from abroad. After three years of food donations, many foreign aid workers in the country have remarked that children in nurseries and kindergartens are looking better -- but that their older siblings are failing. So a month ago, the World Food Program began providing elementary schools with high nutrition biscuits for children aged 7 to 12.\n''We have reason to believe that many people are suffering and that the elderly are a neglected age group that is just getting weaker and weaker,'' Mr. Swedlund said.\nThere are now more than 100 Westerners living in Pyongyang, the capital city, and many say the long-term hunger is readily apparent there. ''If you walk down the street in Pyongyang and ask a child how old she is, you are usually off by three years,'' Mr. Swedlund said. ''She may be 7, but she looks just 3 or 4.''\nDr. Katona-Apte, a nutrition expert who has worked in Bangladesh and Sudan, said she was shocked when she first visited a North Korean kindergarten last year.\n''There were these two children sitting at a desk who were obviously severely malnourished -- they were so thin and they had patchy hair,'' she said. ''And they were just sitting there working. This is accepted as normal. They are in school, and they should really be hospitalized or placed in nutritional rehabilitation. If you saw them in a refugee camp, you would recommend immediate intervention.''\nBut with a severely depleted public health and hospital system, that option does not exist, she and others said. Many Korean doctors do not know how to diagnose or treat malnutrition; few had seen it before this decade. And, in any case, the hospitals lack the food and proper nutritional supplements. Mr. Swedlund said most hospitals lacked medicines, had no glass to replace broken windows and were ''colder inside than out,'' having received no coal since 1994.\nLittle Sanitation, Even in Hospitals\nHe said that even in hospitals, sanitation and water purification systems were virtually nonexistent, because the country lacks chlorine for purification and fuel to run water pumps. He said that next year the Red Cross would start to address those problems, spending $3.5 million on food for hospital patients and $1 million on water treatment.\nWith few other options, vast numbers of North Koreans have resorted to eating ''substitute food,'' hard cakes and noodles made from a mix of nutritional plants, like soybeans and sweet potatoes, combined with indigestible filler, like cornstalks and straw.\n''This now constitutes 40 percent of food intake,'' Mr. Swedlund said. ''It's becoming a regular part of the food basket.'' Doctors in North Korea say many people suffer from stomach aches after eating this partly indigestible material, he said, but added, ''If you're very hungry, it fills your stomach.''\nAlthough the North Koreans date their food problems to a series of floods and droughts in the mid-1990's, the foreign researchers who have worked in North Korea say medical records and childhood growth patterns indicate that the hunger began several years before that and is linked to the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had long been North Korea's main supplier of food, fuel and fertilizer.\nNorth Korea is a mountainous country, with less than 20 percent arable land. It has been a food importer for decades, mostly from the former Soviet Union, but also from China.\n''The country has to come to grips with the fact that this is part of a structural problem and can't just be blamed on the weather anymore,'' Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said.\nStill, she and others praised the normally rigid and secretive Government for slowly loosening its ways. Mr. Swedlund said that after three years in the country, the International Red Cross, which cooperates with the North Korean Red Cross, had found officials increasingly responsive and doctors more willing to share medical records and bring up problems.\nTravel is still restricted. There are more than 70 counties, home to 30 percent of the population, to which aid groups have no access and where they have therefore refused to provide food or medical supplies. Still, the number of counties open to the workers has increased steadily, and freedom to move about has improved.\nMs. Cheng-Hopkins said about half of follow-up inspections were now unannounced, and she noted that the researchers in the nutritional survey were allowed to select villages to visit and enter homes at random.\nAlthough reports based on refugee interviews have been filled with sensational tales of cannibalism and people dying on the roadside, workers from the Red Cross and the World Food Program said they had not observed such scenes and believe that they would have if they were occurring frequently.\n''I have not seen acute starvation like I have seen in Bangladesh,'' Dr. Katona-Apte said. ''But that doesn't mean it can't exist. We're still really limited in what we can see.''\nDiscounting Charge Of Military Theft of Food\nMr. Swedlund said it was unlikely that the counties still closed to foreigners were markedly different from the open ones. And while some have surmised that the closed counties might harbor pockets of death and devastation, he said he accepted North Korea's explanation that they had been excluded for national security reasons.\n''One thing I've learned is how important national security issues are to the North Koreans,'' said Mr. Swedlund, a retired admiral in the Swedish Navy. ''And I really think these areas are important from that standpoint,'' he added, going through a map of closed-off areas and describing what is broadly known about military installations there.\nHe also rejected the notion that the North Korean military is stealing donated food, a charge leveled by the organization Doctors Without Borders when it angrily pulled out of North Korea last summer to protest the many restrictions on groups working there.\nNow that aid groups say they are starting to get somewhat better cooperation from the North Koreans, they hope to repeat their nutrition survey every 6 to 12 months. And they are still analyzing some tantalizing findings: Boys were twice as likely to suffer from stunted growth as girls, and every child whose mother was dead was malnourished.\n''A generation of North Korean children is already scarred for life,'' Astrid Heiberg, president of the International Red Cross, said at a news conference in Beijing after a trip to North Korea. ''We need to continue to mobilize resources to prevent an even greater catastrophe.''","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"c4467181-b99a-4fde-bf2c-21057a46868d","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:52:59.044+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"ceb1e3a2-a1bf-4e26-8489-0c0da3dc1134","content":"[REFLECT]; Word on the Street\n2001-11-11T05:00:00.000Z\nCABBY NO. 1, SEPT. 13\nThe taxi pulls to the curb across the street from the Police Academy on 20th and 3rd.

They go up to other kids they don't even know and ask if anyone would like to call their parents, you know, offering them their phones; other kids announce that they live only two, three blocks away, and if anybody wants, they can come stay at their houses if they don't want to be out in the street. Everybody became so generous. It was almost worth the scare to see it.\n''But then something happened, Dad? I don't think I'll ever get it out of my mind. There was this girl, my age, someone who I never thought of as particularly mature, kind of the opposite in fact, and, this girl, she goes up to one of the teachers and says very calmly, 'I want to get my sister from her class.' Teacher says: 'No. No way I can let you go do that.' The girl says, 'My sister is 6 years old, she gets scared easily, I know she wants me, and I am going to get her.' The teacher says: 'Look, she's with her own group, her own teacher, I'm sure she's fine. They probably told her it was just a fire drill.' And then, Dad, this girl, she says, 'But I know what's going on, and I want my sister with me.' ''\nHis daughter takes a breather, her eyes glistening with unspilled tears. ''I don't know, this girl, it's like in one minute flat, she went from being this flighty kind of kid to this instant adult. It's like she turned into iron. She was so strong and clear about things. I don't even really know her, but I felt so proud for her. . . . But I also felt so sad.''\nHer tears finally ran the rims and spilled down her cheeks. ''I wish I could really find the words to explain to you how I felt.''\nIt took her three weeks, but the words finally came, showing up on her father's desk early one morning, deposited there on her way to school.\n''Dad, it's like these days, there are adults, and there are children. Only two camps now, no intermediate zone for teenagers like myself. If you possess the information, if you understand what's going on in the world, you're an adult, no matter what your biological age; all others are children.\n''There is nothing that traditional 'adults' know that this new breed of 'child-adult' doesn't, and the gut instinct of kids my age to go to their parents and demand comfort, answers or whatever doesn't work now, because we are aware that we know just as much about the world as you do.\n''So many of us have been forced into this new group overnight, like that girl I was telling you about and to some extent, myself.\n''And along with the scariness that comes with being a member of this new group of adults without any actual adult experience, is the sadness that we bear for the years we had to surrender in order to accept this mutual burden with you.''\nROYALTY, SEPT. 29\nIt's the night of the unification bout for the middleweight belt, Felix Trinidad versus Bernard Hopkins, and the garden is boiling over with both the near-insanity of a mass gathering so soon after the events of the 11th, and the anticipation of the state-of-the-art violence to come.\nThe crowd is mad for Felix Trinidad, and there are Puerto Rican flags everywhere, reproduced on T-shirts, head wraps, pennants, scarves and, of course, flags as flags, flags so big it takes two men to display them; dozens of these tag teams work the landings between the multitiered seating sections, racing their pride around the natural oval of the building, blocking the views of hundreds of fans at a clip, although the general consensus seems to be for people to restrain themselves from shouting out something rude and to the point, because the vibes are such that anything, it feels, can lead to anything.\nAfter two interminable hours of prelims, the fanfare that precedes a title bout finally begins. First there's the spotlighting of the usually schizophrenic mix of New York royalty in the crowd: Sharpton, Trump, Spike, Latrell, etc., followed by the calling up into the ring of past middleweight champs: Jake LaMotta, Emile Griffith and other less memorable titleholders. The crowd doesn't really cut loose though until the spotlight falls on Roberto Duran. Looking more like a heavyweight these days, the ex-champ milks the cheers, grinning, dancing, bathing in the love. . . .\nBut then, in the middle of his moment, there seems to be a secondary roar overtaking the first like a succeeding wave, this one a little stronger, a little more from the gut and strangely enough, focused slightly to the side of the ring itself, people half-rising now, some to cheer more loudly, others to track down the source, and there they are, maybe a dozen New York firemen in F.D.N.Y. T-shirts and jeans, heading for their places of honor next to the cast of ''Oz,'' walking a little stiffly, some displaying awkward smiles, others giving up half-waves of acknowledgment, and one can only imagine the great sense of disorientation they must feel; heroes, grievers, survivors; the garden really pouring it on now, the fervid cheers gradually becoming more articulate, breaking down into three distinct sounds: U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A.\nTentatively, as if lowering themselves into scalding water, the city's newest royalty take their seats. (P.S.: Hopkins won the fight.)\nCABBY NO. 3, OCT. 3\n''Fifty-ninth and Madison?''\nThe cab heads uptown, flags fluttering, another Yankee Doodle express. ''So how's it shaking out here?'' the fare asks.\n''Business is bad,'' the cabby says. ''Very bad. Come 9, 10 o'clock? This city is dead.''\n''Are people giving you a hard time?''\n''Not really.'' The driver turns to face his passenger at a red light. ''They've been pretty good. Mostly it's kind of polite interrogations, like, 'Where are you from, what did you do back in your country before you came here, why did you come here?' '' The light changes and he turns back to the traffic.\n''Where do you come from?'' the fare asks. ''I'm just curious.''\n''Bangladesh,'' he says.\n''So nothing ugly? Well, that's good to hear.''\n''I tell you,'' he says, making eye contact through the mirror. ''Do you know what I miss the most? The small talk. I enjoyed that very much. Now they get in, say take me to such and such and then nothing. Except for, you know, like I said, the polite interrogations.''\n''No, I hear you,'' his passenger says.\n''Like you,'' the driver says, briefly turning again. ''Like now.''\nKIDS NO. 3, OCT. 9\n''Dad? Can I tell you something, you promise not to get mad at me?''\n''Not really.''\n''I dropped my cellphone in the toilet,'' his younger daughter says. ''It's dead.''\n''Don't worry about it. Take mine.''\n''Seriously?'' Then, with as much guilt as relief, ''What are you going to use?''\n''Not your problem. It's just, you know, with everything going on these days? It makes me breathe easier to know that I can reach you no matter what.''\nThe kid's face went taut, not what he intended.\n''Look,'' touching her arm. ''Don't get me wrong. Right now, in this city, you need to keep your eyes open. You know, use common sense, or whatever. But it's also very important that you live your life as normally as you can.'' That one opened the flood gates.\n''What if they bomb us?''\n''Who bomb us? Nobody's going to bomb us. I don't even know who they are.''\n''What if they hijack another plane?''\n''Look, here's the deal. You go to school. You work hard, no goofing off. You do your homework, you study for your tests. You go to your soccer practices. Game time rolls around? Not too many headers. Come the weekends? You hang with your friends. Saturday morning? Sunday morning? You have a contest with your sister, see who can sleep the latest, O.K.? You live your life, O.K.?''\n''O.K.,'' her face lightening. A light peck and a dash for the door.\n''Where you headed?''\n''I'm going to hang out with Cole.''\n''Hey. Do me a favor?'' stopping her with one foot in the street. ''Don't go into any big stores tonight, O.K.?''\n''What?'' A little stutter in her step. ''Why?''\n''Just . . . humor me. It's nothing.''\n''O.K.''\n''And stay out of Washington Square.''\n''What's wrong with Washington Square?''\n''Well, I never like you hanging out at Washington Square.''\n''What's wrong with Washington Square?''\n''Absolutely probably nothing. I'm just not too crazy about crowds right now, O.K.?''\n''O.K., O.K.,'' the tightness coming back into her face, but what could you do?\n''And oh,'' he winced pre-emptively. ''The subway? It doesn't exist for you, O.K.?'' then, ''Sorry.''\nBy the time the kid hit the street, she looked as if someone had strapped a boulder onto her back; her father wondering if it was more dangerous for her inside the house than out.\nHAVEN, OCT. 21\nRafiyq Abdellah, born Torrin Williams, enters the visitors' room wearing a gray Velcro-fastened jumpsuit and greets his guest with a standing hug. At first, the talk is of lawyers and postponements, but the conversation turns to the inescapable.\n''Well, I'll tell you, this is not the greatest of times to have a name like mine, you know what I'm saying?''\n''They breaking your back in here?''\n''Yeah, well, I don't want to make too much of it, but like, O.K., what was it, 10 minutes ago I come in here? The, the guard who brought me up? He's like, 'Abdellah, Abdellah, were you tight with the hijackers?' And I'm like, 'Yo, look at my face, hear my speech -- do you think I was tight with the hijackers?'\n''Yeah, and then on the other end of the spectrum, the native-born Muslims in here? Sometimes they look at the African-American Muslims and they're all like, 'You ain't praying right, you don't understand the Koran right, you this, you that. . . . ' I mean, I'll tell you, when we all go to the jumah on Fridays? Man, there is like some spirited disputations in there these days, no lie. . . .\n''I mean, most guys in here, they feel like everybody else about what happened, you know, the horror of it. . . . I mean, there's a few guys, political types, and for them, what happened, it's all about chickens coming home to roost. But I don't see how anybody could say that with an honest heart.\n''And I saw it happen that morning, did I write you about that? You get a pretty good view of the skyline from in here, and when that first building went down? Man, I couldn't even close my mouth.\n''I'd like to think the worst is over, but with the anthrax now and everything? Hey, you know how I feel about being incarcerated in here, right? But I have to say it, with what's going on out there on a day-to-day basis? Rikers might very well be the safest place in the city.''\nNOT NORMAN ROCKWELL, OCT. 24\nUnder a cracklingly blue sky, New York is trying harder than ever to proceed with its spiritual comeback; the shops are more crowded, overheard conversation veers more often to the blissfully inane and erratic bursts of laughter punctuate the soundtrack of the streets, although let's not kid ourselves, the people of this city still carry themselves with a certain humped tension, as if waiting for the next unthinkable.\n''Did you ever hear of Lord Buckley?'' she asks her friend as they cruise the ground floor of a mammoth bookstore. ''Kind of a hipster monologist from the 50's? He had this bit back then about Khrushchev and the H-bomb, and he says something like, 'In times of great uncertainty and terror, humor is the only thing that ensures us that we do not die before we're killed.' ''\n''Yeah, well, have you heard any good jokes lately?'' her friend asks. ''Because I sure haven't.''\n''How about this?'' she responds, gesturing to a freestanding six-book display easel by the information desk. The three titles running across the top row are: ''Rogue Regimes,'' ''Bin Laden: The Man Who Declared War on America'' and ''Terrorism: Today's Biggest Threat to Freedom.'' At the far left on the lower row is ''Living Terrors: What America Needs to Know to Survive the Coming Bioterrorist Catastrophe''; at the far right, ''Jihad''; and dead center, surrounded by all the others, ''New York Landmarks.''\n''Will that do?''\nBack out on the street, they wander down Broadway and notice after a few blocks that the people in front of them have come to a standstill, their eyes on the approaching uptown traffic, where a fire truck is cruising back to its house.\nSome of the people break out in applause. Others wave. The firemen wave back.\n''Can you believe that?'' she says. ''It's like the 1950's. Like Norman Rockwell.''\n''No way,'' her friend says, joining in on the applause. ''There's nothing sentimental about what those guys went through.'' She cut loose with a piercing two-fingered whistle. ''And I'll tell you something else. Right about now? This is probably the least naïve city in the world.''","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"ceb1e3a2-a1bf-4e26-8489-0c0da3dc1134","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:53:11.3+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"cf2e374a-d6a9-4e70-a83c-ffb71efd2180","content":"Foul water after cyclone drains life out of fishing village in Bangladesh\n2007-11-22T05:00:00.000Z\nKANAINAGAR, Bangladesh — To the naked eye, this looks like a village that Cyclone Sidr barely grazed.\nMost of the houses are standing. No one has died. The trees are not even decapitated, as they are in so many hamlets swallowed by the storm.\nBut in this part of the world, where life revolves around water, a closer look reveals how the storm has fouled so much of everyday life. Rice fields are waterlogged. Shrimp ponds have rotted. Women worry what their children will drink once their pots of rainwater run out. Not enough water, too much water, dirty water. Water bedevils everyone.\nAid began to trickle in across the cyclone zone Wednesday, nearly a week after the storm. In this village, a long line of people received sacks of rice, lentils and salt, and the country's neighbors, allies and rivals seemed to fall over themselves to offer charity and succor.\nPakistan, the country's former ruler, against whom Bangladesh fought a bitter war of independence in 1971, announced that it would send two military planes full of medical supplies and blankets. India said an air force cargo plane would arrive Thursday with 38 tons of aid.\nTwo U.S. Navy vessels were expected to arrive with helicopters within days. Saudi Arabia pledged $100 million this week, the largest amount, until the World Bank offered $250 million on Wednesday. Whether and how soon the pledged support will arrive remains uncertain.\nNeither the government nor aid agencies had an estimate on how much money was necessary, but a World Food Program assessment found that $30 million would be required for food just for the next three months. The United Nations resident representative for Bangladesh, Renata Lok Dessalien, said food, water and shelter were the immediate needs, and were all the more acute for cyclone victims who were already poor, likely to be malnourished and vulnerable to disease.\nCyclone Sidr cut a wide path through southern Bangladesh. The government estimates that four million people have been affected. By the army's latest count, 3,167 people have died.\nIn Kanainagar, near Dhaka, the capital, Sunita Mondol, 15 years old, was already feeling the cyclone's toll. She stood at the side of her family's pond in the morning and found no more than two tiny shrimps clinging to her net. On a normal morning, she hauls in a full basket and takes it to the market.\nBut the storm had spoiled the pond, shaking the leaves and branches from the trees and fouling the water, so much that the shrimps died and floated. On the first morning after the storm, Sunita and her family pulled up more than 13 pounds of dead fish. They threw most away.\nFamilies like hers, who make their living from selling the fish and shrimps they cultivate in their ponds, expect to be hurt economically for months. Every family in this village has a small pond, and family after family complained of fouled ponds.\nHalf of the fish in Pinjira Begum's two big ponds floated belly up, which meant that her daily earnings fell by nearly half. The money lender came to her home last Saturday for his weekly payment.\n\"We told him we didn't have money to buy rice for the children,\" she said. She gave him half of what she owed. He cursed her and left.\nSouthern Bangladesh is one of the world's most productive shrimp hubs. Shrimp is one of the country's largest exports to the United States.\nThe lucky ones here had rainwater left in their traditional earthen pots. Those whose water had run out, or whose pots had broken, had to drink the pond water, which had turned salty from seawater and had begun to stink from putrefying leaves.\nA rickshaw puller down the road wondered aloud how long it would be until dysentery struck. Even without a cyclone, he said, water brought a constant specter of disease.\nIn the hot months, when the rainwater stores run out and the ponds start drying up, the people of Kanainagar suffer rashes, dysentery and diarrhea. The cyclone made a chronic concern potentially acute.\n\"Water is our main problem,\" said Alamgir Hossain. \"People get too sick to work, and still they have to buy medicine.\"\nAcross the Mongla River, Muhammad Nantu Mian worked feverishly to salvage what the water had not wrecked. His rice field was flooded, just two weeks before the harvest. The stalks were blown down like scarecrows by the brutal wind. He had drained some of the water by cutting channels in his fields. He hired workers to cut what rice stalks had not yet rotted. He figured a third of his crop was gone.\nNormally, Mian said, he sold half of what he produced, saving the rest for his own family and for seeds for next year. This year, he said, he could reasonably hope to be able to feed his family and not much more.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"cf2e374a-d6a9-4e70-a83c-ffb71efd2180","classname":"Bangladesh","class_id":"d89a6030-48e2-44b1-86d4-e64cfe3abb59","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:53:41.654+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"d0e0834f-da32-41ec-ae85-9461473beb9f","content":"NEWS SUMMARY\n1998-09-07T05:00:00.000Z\nINTERNATIONAL A3-8\nWarning of Chaos in Russia Unless Political Fights End\nViktor S. Chernomyrdin warned on national television that Russia has entered a fiscal nosedive and that further political squabbling could lead to social chaos, on the night before Russia's Parliament was to vote again on whether to confirm him as the country's Prime Minister. A1\nFloods Ravage Bangladesh\nMore than 20 million homes in Bangladesh have been swamped by monsoon season flooding that has lasted almost two months, twice as long as other recorded floods. The waters have inundated more than half of the country, killed more than 520 people, shut down roads, damaged more than 4,000 schools and wiped out a big portion of the rice crop. A1\nEmbassy Bombing Arrests\nInvestigators have arrested two more suspects in the bombing of the United States Embassy in Tanzania and have made significant progress in determining how the bomb was made and taken to the embassy, Federal Bureau of Investigation and local police officials say. The arrests came in the same week that agents investigating the simultaneous attack on the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, began focusing on a Muslim businessman from the Comoros Islands. A3\nEternal Leader in North Korea\nNorth Korea announced that it had revised its Constitution to make its former ''Great Leader,'' Kim Il Sung, the country's ''eternal President.'' President Kim's son Kim Jong Il, the country's longtime ''Dear Leader,'' will in effect be head of state, as chairman of the National Defense Commission. The action leaves North Korea without a living President. A5\nRice Cost Threatens Indonesia\nExperts are warning that the dramatic increase in the price of rice in Indonesia is the biggest threat to stability in the country, as it struggles to regain its political and economic footing. Food riots have already erupted in parts of eastern Java and could spread to major cities like Jakarta. A6\nI.R.A. Leader on Disarming\nGerry Adams, the leader of the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, said that he could not guarantee that the I.R.A. would agree to disarm during talks in the new Northern Ireland Assembly. But last week, Mr. Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, had emphasized that sectarian warfare was a thing of the past. A8\nNonaligned Countries Meet\nDelegates from 113 countries held a summit meeting last week in the South African coastal city of Durban. The chief issues the delegates were said to have discussed were not those topping the Clinton-Yeltsin agenda in Moscow; in fact, the Congo war eclipsed planned talks. It was the 12th meeting of the nonaligned movement, founded as a forum for nations that are neither pro-American nor pro-Soviet. A4\nNATIONAL A9-12\nRepublicans Optimistic About Midterm Elections\nAs they take to the trail this Labor Day for the traditional opening of the fall campaigns, Republican and Democratic candidates say the Lewinsky matter, a jittery stock market and tumult abroad have thrust them into the most unsettled, and unpredictable, election season in years. The uncertainty has already altered the calculations of Republicans, who say they have the most to gain, particularly from President Clinton's difficulties. By contrast, Democrats find themselves on the defensive. A1\nSurge in Union Strikes\nThe recent strikes at Northwest Airlines, General Motors, Bell Atlantic and U S West represent the biggest surge in major walkouts in years and, industrial relations experts say, point to a new aggressiveness on the part of the nation's labor unions. Even though union membership is slipping and the economy is slowing, the experts say, unions have grown bolder because of the tight labor market, more combative union leadership and the teamsters' gains in last year's U.P.S. strike. A12\nA Federal mediator sent negotiators for Northwest Airlines and its striking pilots home, asking them to redouble efforts to end the nine-day strike, which has grounded Northwest's nearly 1,700 daily flights. A12\nPanel Seeks Broad Powers\nThe Judiciary Committee, headed by Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, is seeking sweeping powers never granted to a House panel, as it prepares to accept the report from the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr. The committee will review President Clinton's conduct in the Lewinsky matter and House Democratic and Republican leaders will try to resolve the debate over exempting the committee from many House rules. A10\nPresident Clinton's personal behavior remains Topic A on Capitol Hill since he admitted to having had an inappropriate relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, a former White House intern, and lying about it. A11\nHiring Bonuses for Teachers\nLong accustomed to being supplicants within the labor force, candidates for public-school teaching jobs -- especially in special education, math and science -- are being put in the decidedly unfamiliar position of being wooed with financial sweeteners. In Baltimore this summer, prospective special education teachers were in such demand that those with just a year's experience were offered the starting salaries of four-year veterans. In Massachusetts, nearly 200 of the promising rookie teachers who apply to work in the commonwealth's schools next year will receive $20,000 signing bonuses. A9\nHigh Price of Gas in Texas\nA citizens movement to protest the high price of gasoline has become the hottest political issue in El Paso, drawing in state officials and becoming entangled with a contentious proposal to open a pipeline from the Gulf Coast -- a kind of cavalry charging to the rescue. A9\nNEW YORK/REGION B1-8\nSwissair Flight Recorder Is Found in Nova Scotia\nDivers found one of the two flight data recorders from Swissair Flight 111 on a rocky stretch of sea bottom littered with debris and three major pieces of wreckage of the MD-11. The discovery in Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, raised hopes that investigators would soon know why the plane crashed offshore last week, killing everyone aboard, after a pilot reported smoke in the cockpit. No additional remains of the 229 victims were identified, nor were large numbers of victims found. But officials were clearly relieved that a Navy diving tender, the Sechelt, had found one of the plane's two ''black boxes.'' The box was brought ashore, where technicians immersed it in fresh water and sealed it for immediate shipment to a Transportation Safety Board laboratory in Ottawa. Also, the medical examiner said that the victims' remains were simply in poor condition and DNA analysis could not be performed on all of the remains, so some would be frozen until lawyers and ethicists could decide what to do. A1\nHarlem Rally Under Dispute\nKhallid Abdul Muhammad, the chief organizer of a weekend youth rally in Harlem, was the focus of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's stepped-up defense of police officers who stormed the stage at a the rally on Saturday. The Mayor gave conflicting explanations for the police action. First he said the rally's organizers had flouted a court-ordered deadline for ending the rally. Later he said the police moved in when Mr. Muhammad began inveighing against them. Organizers and community leaders in Harlem accused the city of using excessive force and threatened to sue. A1\nNew Focus on Upstate Voters\nIn the upper corridors of New York State, these final days before the Sept. 15 primary are treating Democratic voters to the spectacle of three quintessential New York City politicians striving for votes by grasping for ties that stretch beyond the five boroughs and their suburbs. They face a beguiling challenge: how to connect to the voters of western, central and northern New York, who are generally skeptical and often feel as shunted to the margins politically as they are geographically. B1\nARTS E1-10\nSPORTSMONDAY D1-10\nShift Seen in Yankees' Goal\nHideki Irabu was a Cy Young award candidate in May, a possible All-Star in June. Now he is in jeopardy of being dropped from the Yankees' rotation and, eventually, from their playoff roster. He gave up six runs to the Chicago White Sox and the Yankees lost 6-5. They have lost 10 of their last 18 games; they must win 17 of their last 22 to pass the mark of 116, set by the 1906 Chicago Cubs. But their focus seems to have shifted to the playoffs.

The Government will portray Microsoft as an information-age monopolist and Microsoft plans a defense with one conspicuous absence -- William H. Gates, the company's chairman. C1\nStart-Ups Suffer Market Jitters\nIf the market falls further and looks as if it will not bounce back, investments by venture capitalists and public stock investors in small technology companies will slow, bankers and investors say.

Then, the cyclone on Nov. 15 destroyed acres of rice paddy, ruined the shrimp farms that dot the southern coast and, according to the World Food Program, left roughly 2.3 million people in need of urgent food aid.\nCyclone relief is now the government's most pressing test, including averting famine and outbreaks of disease and ensuring that aid distribution is perceived to be fair and without corruption. The government estimates that six million people were affected by the storm.\n\"This is going to be the real defining challenge for them,\" Rehman Sobhan, the chairman of the Center for Policy Dialogue, an independent research group based in Dhaka, said of the administration. \"A huge effort is going to be required.\"\nBangladesh is among the world's poorest nations, with a Muslim-majority population of more than 140 million and nearly half of its youngest children suffering from malnutrition. Polls indicate that even before the cyclone, confidence in the government was declining.\nThe way the ordinary Bangladeshi is being pinched every day was on stark display the other day in a working-class quarter of Dhaka called Begunbari, a crowded warren of tenements amid the roar of factories that supply cheap clothes for sale abroad.\nAbdul Aziz, 63, a security guard who was buying vegetables at the local market, quietly confessed that even with three grown daughters working in the garment industry, his family was finding it harder to put enough food on the table.\nOn this afternoon, he bought half as many winter beans as he had hoped to and one small head of cauliflower instead of two. Those purchases, along with the staple rice and lentils, would have to feed his family of seven.\n\"We will make do,\" he said. \"Everyone will have a little bit.\"\nA tailor who serves the neighborhood said his business had plummeted from about 50 orders a day to barely a couple. Few can afford new clothes when the basics - onions, oil, cauliflower - have become so much costlier.\nFiroza Begum, the wife of a civil servant, said the government had failed to curb food prices, even as she gave it credit for cracking down on graft.\n\"They have caught some corrupt people - we can see that,\" she said. \"But we also want them to reduce prices of our daily needs, so we can somehow manage our households.\"\nShe said that she had all but given up buying milk and meat for her family because they were too expensive.\nIn her neighborhood, Election Commission workers were going door to door that afternoon taking names and addresses so they could compile a fresh list of those eligible to vote.\nFakhruddin Ahmed, the civilian leader of the country's caretaker administration, has promised national elections by the end of 2008. But exactly how soon elections will take place and under what circumstances remain mysteries, considering that several major politicians are in jail or in exile.\nThe leaders of the two top political parties, Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and Hasina Wazed of the Awami League, are in custody on various graft and extortion charges. Whether they will be allowed to take part in the election is anyone's guess.\nUnder emergency rule, the press is prohibited from publishing anything deemed \"provocative,\" and political activity is banned, including demonstrations. Holding a political meeting outdoors is punishable by up to five years in prison.\nThe restrictions were loosened slightly in September when indoor political meetings were allowed to resume, but only with permission from the police and with no more than 50 people in attendance.\nAccording to a monthly public perception survey by a consortium of civil society organizations called the Election Working Group, the share of Bangladeshis who expressed high confidence in the caretaker government fell between March and September, while the share of those who had low confidence sharply increased. This was true of respondents from \"ordinary\" and \"elite\" socioeconomic groups.\nIn the latest survey, conducted in face-to-face interviews in late September, the rising price of essential commodities was identified as the biggest concern. Even as the government got good marks for cracking down on corruption, respondents were divided about whether the government had any bearing on their daily lives: 42 percent said they were \"better off\" but about the same percentage said they were \"worse off or that there has been no change in their personal situation.\"\nThe government's anti-corruption crusade continues to be seen as a turning point for Bangladesh, which has consistently ranked at the bottom of the annual Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index.\nBank accounts have been frozen. Luxury cars have been impounded by the state or hidden indoors by their owners for fear they will be taken. Nearly 100 prominent politicians and businesspeople have been taken in for questioning, and an unknown number of people have been detained without charge, which is legal under the new emergency laws.\nA little more than a dozen have been convicted by anti-corruption courts and how quickly, or fairly, the other cases will be tried is unclear.\nIf entrenched corruption was seen as damaging the economy, the crackdown has also sent shocks through the private sector. The government appears to be retreating from its initial wide sweep and has recently released some detainees.\n\"Informally, the government wants some sort of reassurance for the business community that they will be allowed to function,\" said Akbar Ali Khan, a retired senior government official. He declined to grade the government's overall performance - criticizing the government is now a punishable offense - except to say that it was vital for the government to prepare for elections and restore business leaders' confidence in the country.\n\"The economic problems are very serious and acute,\" he said. \"These will have to be addressed with more vigor.\"\nAbdul Awal Mintoo, the chairman and chief executive of Miltimode Group, was among the most prominent millionaires taken into custody in May on a vague charge of destabilizing the government, then released six months later.\nMintoo said that while he was in custody he was interrogated less about his own assets than about what evidence he could furnish against Hasina, the Awami League leader and a former prime minister with whom Mintoo was friendly.\nA naturalized U.S. citizen, Mintoo returned to his native Bangladesh 27 years ago and established a number of businesses, from dealing in agricultural seeds to real estate. He estimates his assets in Bangladesh to be $30 million.\nMintoo, 58, insists that he did not bribe anyone in government in exchange for contracts. But he concedes that he did what he says everyone else has long had to do in this country: grease the wheels of politics and government to get basic things done, including installing a telephone line and getting imported machine parts out of customs.\nIf that were the grounds for his arrest, he said, then \"50 million people, every adult male\" should be arrested.\n\"It's aimless what they're doing,\" he said of the government in an interview, adding that he planned to divest himself of his investments in the country slowly.\n\"I'm not sure how this will end up. I don't want to take a risk and live in uncertainty. If you take blood out of the arteries,\" he added, \"it just paralyzes.\"\nThe only charge pending against Mintoo accuses him of extorting about $700 from a private citizen. Mintoo laughed at the charge, saying it was too paltry a sum for him to demand of anyone.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[{"tagged_token_id":"a7f58d34-38f2-40be-8f8f-258aa9ebec12","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"d1d352ed-86ab-40e5-8c0a-ede7780f0eb4","start":901,"end":908,"tag":"Start date context","tag_id":"d59b20b0-f04b-4098-8f91-1b1050cdb9bd","value":"Nov. 15","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:57:22.242+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"4405592c-bd21-4808-b994-95ade47af8f0","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"d1d352ed-86ab-40e5-8c0a-ede7780f0eb4","start":806,"end":819,"tag":"Flood type","tag_id":"6de6f201-e6f3-46be-845f-21a8d8190680","value":"harsh monsoon","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:54:25.805+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"54195ff6-34d4-4b69-89ee-a4f04efc7f94","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"d1d352ed-86ab-40e5-8c0a-ede7780f0eb4","start":890,"end":897,"tag":"Flood type","tag_id":"6de6f201-e6f3-46be-845f-21a8d8190680","value":"cyclone","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:57:17.786+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"5b1a4077-a6d5-49c2-8c17-b6242e94934d","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"d1d352ed-86ab-40e5-8c0a-ede7780f0eb4","start":977,"end":991,"tag":"region/geographic information","tag_id":"65feb009-90b0-4d3b-aa2c-587669701a70","value":"southern coast","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:56:59.179+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}],"classifications":[]},{"example_id":"d1d800d0-4f3f-4098-990d-9984801b40cf","content":"UN official says climate change could destroy swathes of Indian farmland\n2007-08-07T05:00:00.000Z\nNEW DELHI — As exceptionally heavy rains continued to cut a wide swath of ruin across northern India, a top United Nations official warned on Tuesday that climate change could destroy vast swaths of farmland in this country, ultimately affecting food production and adding to the woes of already desperate peasants who live off of the land.\nEven a small increase in temperatures, said Jacques Diouf, head of the Food and Agricultural Organization, could lower crop yields around the southern hemisphere, even as agricultural productivity goes up in northern climes, including Europe.\nA greater frequency of droughts and floods, one of the hallmarks of climate change, the agency added, could be particularly bad for agriculture.\n\"Rain-fed agriculture in marginal areas in semi-arid and sub-humid regions is mostly at risk,\" Diouf said. \"India could lose 125 million tons of its rain-fed cereal production - equivalent to 18 percent of its total production.\"\nThat is a sign of the steep human and economic impact of extreme weather in India, where a majority of peasants still rely on the rains to irrigate their fields. The monsoon can still make or break rural India's fortunes, as last week's floods have shown. An estimated 20 million people are affected in India alone, with an additional 8 million in neighboring Bangladesh and 300,000 in Nepal, according to the United Nations children's agency.\nThe World Meteorological Organization also said in a statement on Tuesday that the region experienced double the number of monsoon depressions in the first half of the four-month rainy season, causing heavy rainfall and flooding across South Asia. Nearly a third of India's meteorological districts received higher-than-average rains, according to government figures released this week.\nThe Home Ministry's tally read like an inventory of ruin. More than 2 million hectares of cropland had been affected by the floods this year, more than 130,000 houses destroyed, and 1,428 people killed.\nGovernment relief teams have fanned out across northern Assam, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh states, dropping relief packets by air. Even as the rains stopped over the last couple of days, stagnant water raised the risks of water-borne disease, from diarrhea to dengue fever, in areas that are already among the poorest and least healthy, though there were no reports of outbreaks on Tuesday.\nIndia stands to bear the brunt of some of the worst effects of climate change, in large measure because it is ill-prepared. Embankments along rivers and the sea are too fragile to withstand heavy flooding, while rural homes made of mud and thatch are vulnerable. When the water rises, as it does year after year, though to varying degrees, the poorest Indian peasants are virtually stranded.\nHari Kumar contributed reporting from New Delhi.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"d1d800d0-4f3f-4098-990d-9984801b40cf","classname":"Not a historic flood (eg. climate change)","class_id":"33eb7922-7c0c-4f3b-8cd7-b24282055058","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:57:57.9+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"d24666da-13b4-48fa-b1e6-0c0a8f867593","content":"Sidewalk Vendors Rally to Protest Street Restrictions\n1998-06-04T05:00:00.000Z\nAs secretaries and stockbrokers alike came to their defense, hundreds of sidewalk food vendors shut down their carts yesterday and paraded through lower Manhattan to protest Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's plan to restrict street sales in two broad sections of Manhattan next month.\nLawyers in pinstripes and brokers in cuff links applauded as 800 peddlers of hot dogs, falafel and other cart cuisine marched through the financial district a few hours after the 5 A.M. start of a 24-hour work stoppage. It left the city bereft of the ubiquitous carts that Mr. Giuliani considers a main cause of sidewalk congestion.\nThe daylong absence of the $1 coffee-and-bagel specials, the plastic plates of curried chicken and rice and the two-dogs-with-mustard-and-onions lunch had time-pressed New Yorkers grumbling as their stomachs rumbled.\n''Get them back!'' said Ancela Nastasi, a lawyer who said she had voted for the Mayor, as she wandered the cartless canyons of the financial district in quest of a burrito.\nThe Mayor's strongest support came yesterday from proprietors of the coffee shops and restaurants that compete with the carts. John Poulos, owner of the Deli-Burger Restaurant in midtown Manhattan, said he was delighted at the prospect of losing his meals-on-wheels competition. ''They were killing us with their $1 coffee and doughnut,'' he said. ''When I match their price, I lose 20 cents.''\nYesterday's protest resulted in an increase for Mr. Poulos's business, and he was hoping the change would be permanent. The vendors contended that yesterday's sidewalk famine could be a taste of things to come if the Mayor goes ahead with his plan to ban daytime street sales of food, clothing, books and art from most of the financial district and parts of midtown. The city already restricts vending on many stretches of midtown avenues; the new rules would extend the ban to many side streets.\nEleni Pulakos, 39, a sidewalk seller of umbrellas and clothing, asserted that Mr. Giuliani was forgetting his roots in a quest for statewide or national publicity as a tough guy. ''New York is dirty-water dogs,'' she said, using an affectionate term for hot dogs employed by both vendors and their customers.\nAt a news conference after the vendors marched from Liberty Park in the heart of the financial district to Battery Park, where they held a lunch-time rally, Mr. Giuliani defended the new rules as a necessary part of a regulated and civilized society. ''Nobody's going to be out of work,'' he said. ''There are going to be the same number of permits. They're just not going to be able to be in exactly the place that they want to be. And that, of course, makes sense. We can't have three, four, five food vendors all in the same place, crowding the same place.''\nBut the vendors, many of whom are immigrants, said the rules would force them out of work by pushing them to quieter streets with few customers. ''We are not educated people,'' said Syed Sheren, 27, who has sold coffee and doughnuts in midtown since moving from Afghanistan 10 years ago. ''We cannot go work in the bank or work in the office.''\nMohammed Haque, 39, a father of two who sells knishes and pretzels near Wall Street, said he might return to Bangladesh to avoid what he called the shame of welfare. ''I came to this country with good dreams,'' he said.\nThe sidewalk sellers feel they will be put out of business as a result of a series of votes last month by the city's Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel, a board dominated by mayoral appointees. Acting at the Mayor's request, it voted to close 144 blocks of Manhattan starting in mid-July to vending of all sorts.\nYesterday's work stoppage by food vendors, which appeared to be nearly total, was organized by a group called the Big Apple Food Vendors Association, which contends that the restrictions resulted from pressure on Mr. Giuliani from real estate interests and restaurants. The group's president, Jeffrey J. Cicio, said the shutdown of the carts and the demonstration -- at the loss of a day's income, estimated by some vendors at $125 -- would be followed by ''lawsuits, lobbyists and everything else.''\nBecause the rules apply to artists and booksellers, Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said he was considering a First Amendment challenge. Displaying a map of lower Manhattan with yellow highlighting marking the streets that would be affected by the new restrictions, he said: ''A court looking at a map like this will be very suspicious. Is it really about congestion, or is it about competition?''\nSeveral City Council members have introduced bills to abolish the Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel and institute a more systematic approach to regulating the carts. ''The current process is akin to a kangaroo court,'' said Councilman Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat from Brooklyn. ''The regulations are anti-working class and anti-New York.''\nThe new campaign is the latest in decades of efforts by many mayors to corral the food vendors. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch said yesterday that Mr. Giuliani was making the same mistake he had made when he proposed a bill in 1985 that would have barred food vending from much of midtown. ''The realtors and the theater owners came in to me and said, 'We don't want these people,' and I listened to them,'' Mr. Koch said. ''But then I thought, what are we doing? These are decent people, and they give people the chance to buy an inexpensive lunch.''\nAfter taking a look at the so-called congestion himself during a walk through midtown, Mr. Koch retracted his own bill. In 1988, however, Mr. Koch ordered the police to begin enforcing a 1983 law banning vendors from the most congested areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. More than 1,000 vendors marched on City Hall in protest.\nIn an agreement with the City Council six weeks later, Mr. Koch relented in return for an agreement allowing no more than 10 vendors on each block in midtown. Shortly after taking office in 1994, Mr. Giuliani renewed the debate with the Council over how to enforce laws and regulations regarding vendors, which led to the formation of the Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel.\nThe vendors' procession yesterday was led by a cart sporting the Hebrew National umbrella and plastered with ''Going Out of Business'' signs. As the vendors wended down Broadway, past Wall Street and Exchange Place, people emerged from subway stations and offices to cheer them on.\nJulia Kaufmann, 30, a management consultant, said she was bitter about having to spend twice as much for her morning coffee at a shop and that she was mystified by the cart crackdown. ''You never say: 'Oh, my God. If that vendor weren't there, it would be easier for me to get around,' '' she said.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"d24666da-13b4-48fa-b1e6-0c0a8f867593","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T09:59:24.268+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"d5da01b6-d4ca-4dcd-96b1-704e46e47d1c","content":"Cuttings: A Land Rush for Compost in the City\n2001-06-16T05:00:00.000Z\n IT looked like a gathering of the nations two Sundays ago, on the parking lot of Medgar Evers College in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Only these delegates weren't talking global warming, but shoveling deep, dark compost as fast as they could. \n Every New York City resident who got there in time (this black gold went fast) was allowed 30 gallons — enough to fill a large trash can — from the Department of Sanitation, which had delivered 90 cubic yards that morning for the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Urban Composting Project. \n \"My friend told me my rhododendrons are dying because my soil is so compacted,\" said a woman in an orange linen suit, having rushed over from services at the Bethany Baptist Church. \"They can't live because I don't put anything in the soil.\" She seemed on a mission, as she gingerly shoveled away, trying not to mess up her pretty dress and pumps. \n A Bangladeshi boy who now lives in Queens, 12-year-old Novel Ahmed was working alongside his mother, Zulhas Bagum, and his older sister Rumena Kabir. \"We have a backyard of vegetables, fruit, flowers, tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, green chilies and jute leaves,\" Ms. Kabir said. \"We were going to buy compost from Home Depot when we saw a notice about this on TV.\" \n While Novel scraped the blacktop for the last crumbs of compost, Ms. Kabir bought a rigid black plastic composter for $20 — a big discount from the $70 store price — and the family headed home to treat their garden to this feast of nutrients teeming with micro-organisms ready to work on tired soil. \n Eilaine Li from Coney Island and Brent Li from Bay Ridge were helping their clan fill 15 rice bags with the crumbly compost that was headed for their mother's house. \"She needs it for her flowers and vegetables,\" said Mr. Li, as his relatives hefted the heavy bags into their van. \n Some arrived too late, so fast had the garden locusts descended on the pile, and Bernadette Dorvil was literally in tears. `I came so far to get here,\" said Ms. Dorvil, who lives in Canarsie. \"I'm shocked. I never saw the compost. Just the bare floor.\" She looked so sad that Suzanne Curley, a gardener from Park Slope, handed her one of her own bags. And Daxius Gregory, a composting instructor from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, offered another. \n \"You think if I shed a tear, this gentleman would help me?\" asked Rose Butler, who grows blueberries and figs on her fire escape in Bedford-Stuyvesant. She had hoped to load her blue Ford pickup with her allotment of 30 gallons and head down to Williamston, N.C., where she grows a field of corn, collards, tomatoes and squash. \n Such is the passion compost inspires, and for good reason. If you don't have a compost pile on the edge of your garden, or an indoor worm box tucked in a corner of the kitchen or basement, you are missing out on nature's own fertilizer. \n Entire books have been written on the art of composting and its benefits, from the complex \"Rodale Book of Composting,\" edited by Deborah Martin and Grace Gershuny (St. Martin's Press, 1992) to a paperback called \"Worms Eat My Garbage,\" by Mary Appelhof, who explains how redworms do the job (Flower Press, 1997). A good one to start with is \"Easy Compost: The Secret to Great Soil and Spectacular Plants,\" edited by Beth Hanson, one of the many excellent handbooks from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's 21st Century Gardening Series. \n Composting can create the kind of topsoil it takes nature about a century to create without human help, and depending on how compulsive you are, you can turn your leaves, clippings and vegetable matter from the kitchen (no meat or grease, though, as these attract rodents) into sweet- smelling nutrients in six weeks to a year. A fast \"hot\" pile has equal amounts of carbon-rich material (brown leaves, pine needles, twigs, eggshells, shredded newspaper) and nitrogen-rich material (green leaves, vegetable and fruit peelings, coffee grounds or spent flowers). \n If you turn these elements regularly, to aerate the pile, and keep it moist but not wet, an army of earthworms, sowbugs, centipedes, mites, beetles, molds, fungus and bacteria will transform this \"waste\" — which otherwise gets trucked at great cost to a landfill — into humus, a complex stew of biochemical compounds that can bring moisture, air and nutrients to worn-out soil. It can also protect roots and plants from pathogens. \n To get interested gardeners started down the fascinating road of composting, try an excellent Web site, www.soilfoodweb.com by Dr. Elaine Ingham, a soil scientist based at Oregon State University, as well as the resource lists in back of books like those mentioned above. Gardens can really thrive with the stuff, and why pay for it when it's sitting right there in your kitchen and backyard? \n Most botanical gardens and county agricultural extension services provide information and maybe even workshops on composting, and some municipalities offer free compost. \n New York City's botanical gardens also offer compost \"help lines\" and e-mail addresses: \n Bronx: bronxcompost@nybg.org or (718) 817-8543. \n Brooklyn: compost@bbg.org or (718) 623-7290. \n Manhattan: manhattancompost @nybg.org or (718) 817-8543. \n Queens: compost@queensbotanical.org or (718) 539-5296. \n Staten Island: sibgcompost @erols.com or (718) 273-0629. \n Gardeners eager for compost have another chance at a giveway: in Manhattan today from noon to 4 p.m., at the Pier 84 Urban Gardening Festival (south of the Intrepid Sea- Air-Space Museum at West 44th Street and 12th Avenue).

None has ever filibustered against a bill or shouted down an opponent on the City Council floor.\nA telling sign of the odd fact of their absence from politics was evident at a reception at the City Hall restaurant in TriBeCa on Tuesday for 12 of the 13 Asian-American candidates for the City Council: none of them hogged the microphone. As they addressed about 150 people under the barrel-vaulted ceiling of a crowded downstairs room, they generally respected the three-minute limit.\nThough they gathered under the unifying rubric of Asian-American candidates, there were differences among them. For one, they have come from several different countries -- China, Taiwan, Bangladesh, South Korea, India and India by way of the Caribbean. And some of them are expected to oppose each other as they fight for seven Council seats in Democratic primaries in Lower Manhattan and Flushing, Queens, next September.\nBut all of them agreed that the odd fact must change. And with two-thirds of Council seats up for grabs this year because of term limits, now may be the time.\n''We have 10 percent of the population but 0 percent of the governance,'' said Parag Khandhar, a policy analyst for the Asian American Federation of New York, which sponsored the event. He called this a ''landmark year,'' however, because no more than five Asian-Americans had run in past council elections.\nFour of the thirteen candidates are women. One is Margaret Chin, who is running in District 1 in Lower Manhattan, which covers Chinatown. ''I want to move the Asian-American community into the mainstream,'' she said, ''so we can work for education reform, more housing and better access to medical care.''\nIf her list of issues sounds like it could appeal to all kinds of voters, that was probably by design. Several speakers, including Ms. Chin, appealed for support not because they were Asian-American but because, they said, they were the best candidate.\nYet, an informal poll of those gathered at the event, almost all of them Asian-American, revealed a kind of emerging political infrastructure. There was hardly a nonpolitician to be found among the networking members of tenant and civic associations, business councils and political clubs.\n''It's reminiscent of every immigrant group in New York City,'' said Matt Aubry, an advisor to John Liu, a candidate in District 20 in Flushing. ''Like the Italians, Irish and African-Americans, it's time for Asian-Americans to step into political legitimacy.''

But in the end it’s the same. I have nothing left.”\nOnly the thatch roof of his house was visible above the muddy waters that turned his village of Malinagar into a lagoon in August. Beneath the rippling surface, the straw walls had caved in and his stock of grain for the winter, clothes, furniture and possessions were slowly rotting. \n The monsoon rains in India are a democratic force. When the skies open, the water pours on the homes of rich and poor alike. But after the deluge, the poor always suffer most. \nOn Aug. 16, Unicef officials said that about 2,800 people in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan had died since the monsoon season began, from drowning, waterborne illnesses, snakebites or hunger. \nBut for survivors, the real endurance test is just beginning. With crops destroyed and fields bloated with water, there will be no agricultural work for millions of landless laborers here for months, leaving them to rely on the sporadic support of aid agencies and government relief organizations. Unicef said it was concerned about the prospect of worsening child malnutrition. \nBihar is the least developed state in India, barely touched by the booming growth and new economic confidence of the major cities. Yet there are gradations within this poverty, and subclasses of richer and poorer. \nThe wealthier residents of Malinagar still have their homes, made from sturdy brick and concrete. Some managed to find shelter on their flat roofs when the flooding began here at the beginning of August. The poorer, living in shacks without electricity at the exposed edges of the village, had to flee to roughly made shelters on higher ground. \n The floodwaters began receding in mid-August, replaced by a stinking, stagnant sludge, but villages remained cut off, and many of those houses that have re-emerged are uninhabitable. Hundreds of thousands of people are sheltered beneath bed sheets along raised highways, just inches away from the traffic, which grinds past, splattering them with mud. Life cannot yet begin again for most of the 14 million people that the United Nations estimates have been affected by the crisis in Bihar. \n In certain lights, in the lull between storms, Malinagar becomes a mirage of watery beauty. Beyond the shells of flooded houses, the waters from the burst Bagmati River stretch as far as the eye can see. In July, the lake was a parched wheat field. Now village girls sit like mermaids, combing their hair, half-submerged in the calm waters; children shriek with excitement as they splash along the shore. \n But Shankar, who goes by only one name, finds nothing to rejoice about. The 25-year-old is familiar with the deprivation that follows the flood. His wife and two daughters, 1 and 6 years old, live on the wages he earns as a laborer in the fields. \n “There is no work, so there is no money,” he said. “I’m worried about how the children will eat. Even now we are eating dry bread with salt. It’s very sad for the children to live like that.” \n The village leader, Vijay Sharma, said those with the least to lose had lost the most. “The richer villagers have ways of working things out,” he said. “The poorest will not get any work for months more. I don’t know how they are going to survive.” \n At a national level, the plight of these flood victims arouses little compassion. In early August, when the United Nations declared the floods the worst in living memory, the miserable condition of the 31 million people affected in India was covered internationally but was neither front-page news in New Delhi newspapers nor featured on national news channels. Instead, bulletins were dominated by the sentencing of a Bollywood star to jail.\n Such apathy is not unusual. Newspapers in India often neglect the suffering of the rural poor, more preoccupied with the triumphs of the emerging India than with the familiar stories of extreme hardship experienced by hundreds of millions of Indians living on the land. \n Even within the government, attempts to implement a national flood prevention policy have been halfhearted. Saifuddin Soz, the Indian water resources minister, said he hoped that more resources might be granted as a result of the severe flooding this year. “Once the crisis is over I will be calling on the cabinet to create a national commission for flood management,” he said. \n Among the homeless, waiting for the waters to dry up, there was little optimism. Manohar Paswan, 45, stared across the water at the rubble that used to be his house, his head shaven out of respect for the youngest of his seven children, a 6-month-old boy, Nitish, who died in the second week of August, bitten by one of the poisonous snakes that thrive in the floodwaters. Marooned, there was no way of getting help. Now, Mr. Paswan is concerned about how his family will eat. “Government help is nowhere to be seen,” he said.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"dc63022e-4afe-4467-b226-d4ad5a4ca800","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:00:50.786+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"dc8f9373-99b4-4b92-94f4-35eb22bb7830","content":"South Asia grapples with results of flooding\n2007-08-04T05:00:00.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh — Nothing tests the mettle of government in this part of the world than a fierce monsoon, as unusually heavy rains across South Asia showed this week, leaving a trail of death and ruin and raising the risk of disease.\nFreak rains, which scientists describe as a hallmark of climate change, seemed to be responsible. The devastation was all the more severe because flimsy dams and embankments collapsed under the weight of floodwaters. The mud houses of the poor were the first to wash away.\nWeather scientists have said South Asia is likely to get much more unpredictable rain in the coming decades, bringing greater challenges for its governments to prepare and cope with nature's fury.\nIn Bangladesh, which is perennially inundated because so much of it is low-lying delta, more than half of the districts were under water. More than one million families were affected by flooding, according to government officials; the death toll after a week's heavy rains stood at 58.\nAccording to the country's meteorological department, Bangladesh received just under 29 inches of rain in July, about double the average. Bangladesh also felt the brunt of greater rain upstream in northern and northeastern India, as swollen rivers broke through their banks on their way down to the Bay of Bengal, said Saiful Hossain, executive engineer of the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center, a government agency.\nThe flooding has presented the country's army-backed caretaker government, which took power in January, with its latest and perhaps toughest challenge. Its impact could already be felt far beyond the flood-affected districts. Prices of essential commodities, including food, have spiked in recent weeks because of flooded roads have disrupted transportation links. The government sought this week to dispel public anxiety over food shortages, saying that it is prepared to bring food from abroad.\n\"We'll import more food, if necessary,\" the finance adviser, Mirza Azizul Islam told reporters in Dhaka. \"There is nothing to be scared of.\"\nAs in all floods every year, nature shared blame with human negligence. A 600-mile flood protection dam was badly damaged this year.\nIn Nepal, unremitting rains for the last two weeks flooded entire swaths across the heavily populated southern plains, known as the Terai Region, on the border with India. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that up to 300,000 people were in need of water, food and other humanitarian supplies. Nearly 10,000 people were displaced, and 84 had been killed, said Paul Handley, a field coordinator with the agency. He added that the full scale of damage could be ascertained only in the coming days to determine how much agricultural land had been ruined and how many buildings destroyed.\nNepal, too, is accustomed to floods each year. But the unusually heavy rains this year seems to have affected more of the country, and with rainwater pooling up and refusing to recede, fragile mud buildings are threatened, and the likelihood of an outbreak of water-borne diseases like diarrhea also increases.\nThe United Nations and aid agencies in Nepal have already nearly exhausted their supplies of food and other goods, Handley said, although the monsoon season is not expected to end for at least another month.\nIn India, the monsoon's trail of destruction traveled to the north and northeast last week. The death toll since the start of the monsoon in June stood at 1,225, according to the Home Ministry.\nThe military was deployed to the worst affected states, including Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where more than 12 million people have been affected by flooding over the last week. The Indian Air Force air-dropped food packets to displaced people in Bihar on Saturday, where 70,000 houses were damaged, according to the Press Trust of India,\nPakistan has already had its turn with flooding. In July rains in Baluchistan and Sindh provinces, the death toll reached 329 and 90,000 families were made homeless, the United Nations said.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[{"tagged_token_id":"b658b8f9-9d7c-42f8-a3e7-38ec609f8530","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"dc8f9373-99b4-4b92-94f4-35eb22bb7830","start":1168,"end":1172,"tag":"Start date context","tag_id":"d59b20b0-f04b-4098-8f91-1b1050cdb9bd","value":"July","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:24:33.338+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"0ed5de14-8802-463f-a049-b4a80e44b2dd","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"dc8f9373-99b4-4b92-94f4-35eb22bb7830","start":181,"end":203,"tag":"Flood type","tag_id":"6de6f201-e6f3-46be-845f-21a8d8190680","value":"unusually heavy rains ","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:24:15.033+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"dc8f9373-99b4-4b92-94f4-35eb22bb7830","classname":"Monsoon ","class_id":"a4fc0707-94d3-4ddb-8b3a-6dd4da2f2e84","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:23:56.635+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"e1a1be75-54a5-437c-b12d-d4dec76c8d3e","content":"More rain hits India as heath workers race to avert outbreak of disease\n2007-08-09T05:00:00.000Z\nNEW DELHI — Heavy monsoon rains lashed new areas of India, submerging dozens of villages in the west, as health workers raced to provide food and medicine to avert an outbreak of disease in the waterlogged north, officials said Thursday.\nMore than two weeks of monsoon rains across much of northern India, Bangladesh and Nepal have flooded rivers and inundated plains, killing at least 475 people and stranding about 19 million more, officials said.\nAir force helicopters joined soldiers and the civilian authorities in rescue operations after torrential rains Wednesday cut off more than 400 villages in the western Indian state of Gujarat, killing at least seven people, said D.

B. Prasad, the director-general of state health services.\n\"Adequate stocks of medicines have reached the flood-hit areas,\" he said Thursday.\nInternational aid agencies have warned that stagnant waters left by the floods were a lethal breeding ground for germs causing diarrhea, waterborne diseases and various skin diseases, with children, who make up 40 percent of the South Asian population, particularly susceptible.\nIn Bangladesh, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization, Fadela Chaib, said 1,400 cases of diarrhea had been reported this week.\nThe World Food Program and Unicef have been distributing emergency food supplies to thousands of people in Bangladesh and Nepal, Simon Pluess, the World Food Program spokesman in Geneva, said.

For years, the Mobil filling station at the southeast corner of First Avenue and 90th Street was a thriving corner of Islam. Pakistani station attendants would pray in corners on musallahs, or prayer mats, while South Asian cabdrivers -- mostly Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi -- used the station as a dispenser of coffee, gasoline and neighborly gossip.\nBut this month, the cabs and the people disappeared, and a ''For Sale'' sign went up where the gasoline pumps used to be.\nLast year, the Mobil Corporation, which owned the station, quietly transferred the site to the Mobil Foundation, a charitable organization that decided to take advantage of the booming real estate market and put the site up for sale.\nSix large developers each bid several million dollars for the property and now one of those developers may soon be closing the deal.\nThe possible buyer is RFR/Davis Partners, a Manhattan-based developer that has been building luxury rental apartments. The principal partners are Aby Rosen, Michael Fuchs and Trevor Davis. A spokesman for RFR/Davis would not provide details of the deal, but said that the company was ''close to closing.''\nThe 9,682-square-foot site is zoned for residential use.

In Sydney, you can't drink the water.\nThe city's water company said that it had detected dangerous parasites in its largest treatment plant and that water would be unsafe to drink from the tap until at least Sunday. The parasites, giardia and cryptosporidium, can cause severe gastrointestinal problems and are especially dangerous to children.\nThe news that their water supply was contaminated was received by many of Sydney's residents as if their beloved city, which is already decorated with bunting of the Olympic Games for which it will be the host in two years, had suddenly found itself transplanted to the third world.\nThe water company, Sydney Water, may be regretting a recent advertising campaign in which Australian Olympians praised the city's water for its purity.\n''If this was Dhaka after a flood, you might understand it, but how has this been allowed to happen in Sydney?'' Peter Collins, a local politician, asked in an unflattering comparison to the capital of Bangladesh.\nSydney's largest tabloid newspaper ran a list of other large cities where the tap water is unsafe to drink, including Calcutta, India; Caracas, Venezuela, and Kinshasa, Congo.\nFew businesses in Sydney, Australia's largest city, were unaffected by the water crisis. Harbor-side bars with views out toward Sydney's fabled Opera House were ordered to stop serving drinks with ice; supermarkets quickly ran short of bottled water; hospitals cut back the number of surgeries because of a lack of clean water to wash wounds.\nFire hydrants and water valves across the city were open to flush out the system.\n''Never before in our lifetimes have we been afraid of the tap water in our own city,'' a writer for The Sydney Morning Herald said. ''We have turned into a city of hypochondriacs, noting every tummy twinge.''\nOpposition politicians describe the water crisis as especially embarrassing given the presence of both Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, who are in Sydney for meetings with their Australian counterparts. Aides to Ms. Albright and Mr. Cohen arrived in their hotel rooms to find a message light on their telephones blinking, with a warning from the concierge not to even think of drinking from the tap.\nUtility officials say it is still unclear what caused the contamination by the one-celled parasites, which live in the intestines of people and animals. One theory under investigation is that a dead kangaroo or wombat fell into a dam or other catchment area near the filtration plant. Other officials suggested a malfunction at the plant itself.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"e472f005-33c8-496b-a804-f17724e99dcb","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:26:03.282+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"e4a7d682-d27c-4c0c-aa8e-181f927782c1","content":"U.N. Report Maps Hunger 'Hot Spots'\n2001-01-09T05:00:00.000Z\nHunger currently afflicts 830 million people around the world because of natural disasters, armed conflict and a grinding poverty that consigns the poor to chronic malnutrition, the United Nations World Food Program reported today.\n''From generation to generation, people don't have enough food to eat,'' Catherine Bertini, the agency's executive director, said at a news briefing, where she distributed a map calling attention to ''hot spots'' where hunger is most severe. The map identifies large swathes of territory in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia where tens of millions of people, most of them women and children, cannot get enough to eat.\n''The combination of poverty and disaster causes people to have even less possibility to build resources to end their hunger,'' Ms. Bertini said.\nThe World Food Program defines hunger as a condition in which people fail to get enough food to provide the nutrients for active, healthy lives. Those who are considered undernourished subsist on 1,800 calories a day or less. The figure of 2,100 calories is generally recommended to sustain an average adult.\nAlthough the data the program uses was collected for 1995 to 1997, officials said that their research shows that the scope of the problem has not improved, and in some places is getting worse.\nOf the 830 million undernourished people, the report says, 791 million live in developing countries. The food agency said that 200 million are children under age 5 who are underweight for lack of food.\nIn more than 20 countries, hunger has been compounded by drought, which the agency said has affected 100 million people within the last year. The agency helped feed 16 million people hit by drought last year, compared with 3 million in 1996. In other areas, internal unrest has made it harder, if not impossible, to grow crops and get them to market.\n''We've seen an alarming trend where the poorest nations are hit simultaneously by both natural and man-made emergencies, including in Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Tajikistan,'' Ms. Bertini said. ''Unfortunately, we see a potential for that to continue or even increase in 2001.''\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, 180 million people, one-third of the population, are undernourished, the agency reported. The countries worst hit by hunger include Angola, Burundi, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea.\nIn Asia the number of undernourished people is 525 million, or 17 percent of the population, with the worst hunger found in North Korea, Mongolia, Cambodia and Bangladesh.\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, 53 million people, or 11 percent of the population, lack enough food, with the worst conditions in Haiti, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Honduras.\nElsewhere, one of the countries with the greatest problem is Afghanistan, which is ravaged by civil war as well as the worst drought in decades.\nAsked about Iraq, which has suffered from United Nations economic sanctions imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Ms. Bertini said that 15 percent of Iraqis were malnourished. ''Poor children under 5 are the people most at risk in Iraq,'' she said.\nMs. Bertini said that while conditions have improved in some countries -- like Bosnia, Namibia and Botswana -- they have deteriorated in others, like Afghanistan. In Eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union, the transition from Communism to a free-market economy has caused suffering for people who cannot afford to eat properly.\nThe World Food Program reported feeding 89 million people last year, including refugees uprooted by wars and natural disasters. The food agency, based in Rome, operates in more than 80 countries.\nMs. Bertini said that countries struggling to overcome hunger need not only food but also water drilling and purification equipment and better sanitation and agricultural systems. In sub-Saharan African, progress has also been impeded by heavy government debt burdens, insufficient funding for health and education and the AIDS pandemic.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"e4a7d682-d27c-4c0c-aa8e-181f927782c1","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:26:09.786+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"e4d523d9-c6f3-49ae-941e-36cd6006010d","content":"American Palates Awaken To the Bold Tastes of India; As the latest fusion star, creative Indian cuisine vies with its Asian rivals.\n1998-03-25T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE soup may look familiar enough -- at least at first. It's a tomato soup, after all, and it's served with croutons. But the croutons are made of the Indian bread called nan, and the dish is spiked with roasted cumin and coriander seeds, and soothed with yogurt. It's Western comfort food married to Indian spice.\nAnd it's a wonderful concoction, glowing with flavor, created by Floyd Cardoz, a chef who was born and first trained in India. But he also honed his craft in Switzerland before coming about 10 years ago to New York, where he landed at Lespinasse, a four-star restaurant that has no inhibitions about breaking cultural barriers and infusing classical French food with Asian flavors.\nOn every culinary front, in fact, the walls between traditional cuisines are giving way to fusion. Thai-French at Vong or Japanese-Latin American-Egyptian-French at Nobu, to take two good examples. (Some walls are meant to be left standing, though, or you end up with dishes like Peking duck with pesto.)\nNow, it's India's turn, the newest player on the fusion front. Even more, it is an expanding cuisine that is being cooked with greater authority and flair than ever before in America.\nIts practitioners -- some who journeyed here from the Indian subcontinent, others who are Americans who trained there or studied Indian cooking here -- are poised to make an impact few could have imagined 5 or 10 years ago, before Americans had fully developed a hunger for adventurous, boldly flavored food.\nRestaurants like Match, Match Uptown and City Wine and Cigar Company are adding Indian spices and flavors to their menus. A flurry of ambitious Indian restaurants are also on the way. Sophisticated Indian takeout has arrived in the Hamptons, and soon there will be stuffed Indian breads and tandoor wraps to go in Manhattan, when Cafe Spice opens this spring on University Place in Greenwich Village and later on the lower level of Grand Central Terminal, with Junior's Cheesecake and City Bakery as its neighbors. Even in the average supermarket, Basmati rice is being joined by tins of crisp, chickpea-flour papadum chips and chilled containers of fresh chutneys.\nThe culinary vocabulary is changing again. We know pesto and focaccia; now it's time to learn about raita and paratha, and that the taste of India is not merely a matter of throwing in some curry powder.\nAt Raga, a new Indian restaurant in Greenwich Village, the chef, Geetika Khanna, takes a classic French leek and potato soup, and adds a scattering of garam masala, a spice mix that is the grated parmesan of India. When garam masala -- which combines cardamom, cloves, cinnamon and black pepper -- becomes as familiar as balsamic vinegar or lemongrass, there is bound to be a better appreciation of the interplay of nutty, musty, cooling, citric, earthy and sharp flavors that give Indian food its stunning depth and complexity.\nThis summer, Tabla, a restaurant that will be about as Indian as you can get without serving rogan josh, is coming to Madison Avenue, near 25th Street. Danny Meyer and Michael Romano, who are partners in Union Square Cafe, have hired Mr. Cardoz as the chef de cuisine. And there is every likelihood that New Yorkers will clamor for tables in a handsome new restaurant that is a departure from the cliches and cheap buffet lunches of the budget places on East Sixth Street, or even from the tandoor Taj Mahals of midtown.\nThey will find the mouth-filling flavors of the subcontinent applied to salmon fillets, racks of lamb and other American crowd-pleasers. Mr. Cardoz will cook a seared striped bass crusted with garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander and tamarind, and soft-shell crabs with an Indian spice rub. It is the kind of cooking that another well-traveled chef, Gray Kunz of Lespinasse, encouraged him to do. Mr. Cardoz, who was chef de cuisine at Lespinasse until last fall, said that it was his first chance to experiment and to broaden the horizons of his native cuisine. Mr. Kunz, who grew up in Singapore and worked in Hong Kong, is a chef to whom fusion comes naturally.\n''If I hadn't met Gray, I'd have been stuck in a rut the way a lot of Indian cooks are,'' Mr. Cardoz said.\nMr. Romano, the executive chef at Union Square Cafe, studied Indian cuisine with Julie Sahni, one of New York's top teachers, and has been to India twice. ''The public has become familiar with other Asian cuisines,'' he said. ''They're ready for Indian.''\nReady enough, like Mr. Romano, to sample it firsthand: between 1994 and 1996, the number of Americans visiting India increased by one-third. And travel has always broadened palates.\n''You have to accept that all food is fusion,'' said Madhur Jaffrey, the Indian cookbook author. ''It used to happen slowly, but now you see it at great speed.''\nImmigrants from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka propel the movement. Groceries with sacks of colorful lentils, blocks of tart-sweet tamarind paste and jars of cardamom pods have brought Indian ingredients to the American marketplace.\nAmericans are no longer terrified of spices. The annual consumption of spices has increased from 2 pounds a person in 1976 to 3.1 pounds in 1996, according to the American Spice Trade Association. Once-timid souls consumed nearly 10 times as much cumin between 1991 and 1995 as between 1981 and 1985.\nIn addition to more spice, Indian cuisine offers Americans the enticements of flatbreads like parathas, pancakes and fried snacks. Samosas, fried turnovers typically stuffed with spiced potatoes and peas, are catching on. Ms. Khanna fills hers with a goat cheese mixture and with bacalao. Gary Robins at Match Uptown serves lamb samosas alongside Chinese dumplings as appetitzers. At Pondicherry, a new French-Indian fusion restaurant on 58th Street, samosas are filled with crab and duck confit.\nLast summer, Isabel and Gary MacGurn, who met while cooking at an ashram in India, opened a takeout shop, Hampton Chutney, in Amagansett, N.Y., to serve dosas, the big, lacy rice-flour pancakes from southern India, rolled up with inventive fillings like portobello mushrooms and goat cheese, and smoked turkey with balsamic-roasted onions. Lines were out the door, and at least one customer a week suggested they open in Manhattan. Not yet.\nFor one thing, they're too busy selling their fresh chutneys. Unlike sticky bottles of Major Grey's, the fresh chutneys are not strictly Indian and make terrific cocktail party dips. The dosas, just in time for the wrap mania, cut across ethnic lines. ''It's really exciting to see construction workers, not just sophisticated New Yorkers, pull up and order dosas,'' Mrs. MacGurn said.\nAnother trend is Indian-spiced seafood tartares with crisp papadums. John Villa, the chef of the Boathouse restaurant in Central Park, which will soon reopen as Park View at the Boathouse, plans to serve them. Dean Willis, the chef at the Garrick, which is to open in about a week in the Mayfair Hotel, on 49th Street near Broadway, is putting salmon tartare dressed with raita on his menu, garnished with papadums. He also makes the dish with lobster.\nA major player in the Indian story in the United States is Raji Jallepalli, the chef and owner of Restaurant Raji in Memphis. She and her husband, who came to America from Hyderabad as students, eventually earned enough in medical careers to make the fine-dining rounds. Ten years ago, Ms. Jallepalli opened her small restaurant. Jean-Louis Palladin became her mentor.\n''I always felt that French food could benefit from a lift, a bit of spice,'' she said.\nOther prominent American chefs, like Gary Danko in California and Nora Pouillon in Washington, have been putting tastes of India on their menus for some time. There is a tandoor oven at Biba in Boston. When Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger owned City Restaurant in Los Angeles, they had a tandoor, too. E & O Trading Company, a new brewery-restaurant in San Francisco, serves inventive nan breads and chicken in a tandoor marinade. The menu also includes Thai shrimp and root beer floats.\nIn a few months, David Shah, a new owner of the venerable Akbar on Park Avenue, will open Ada on East 58th Street. It will serve French desserts and no cheap buffet lunch.\nAt Bombay Palace in midtown, rounds of nan, topped with grilled vegetables, shrimp or chicken, are called Indian pizzas. Bay Leaf in Manhattan and Bombay Club in Washington are putting a modern spin on traditional Indian food. Niota in SoHo is adding fusion dishes, which will not be served family style. Sensing an opportunity, the owners of Tamarind, the elegant Indian restaurant in London's Mayfair district, plan to open in New York.\nMr. Willis of the Garrick, who grew up eating Indian food in London, said that he had always wanted to work Indian seasonings into his food but that his employers weren't interested. ''It takes a certain expertise,'' he said. ''You need a good palate, and you have to proceed with caution.''\nAs alluring as a tart whiff of amchur mango powder might be, it's not for everybody. Jonathan Waxman, who brought California cuisine to New York, is putting considerable distance between himself and the Indian spice rack. ''I'm not comfortable with it,'' he said. ''The spices, combinations and even the terms are very daunting. Now I'm afraid you'll start to see plates of Thai noodles and Italian sun-dried tomatoes in an Indian-spiced curry sauce.''\nIt wouldn't be a surprise.\nThe Corner Bazaar\nFOR shoppers in search of Indian ingredients, New York has a number of authentic food shops.\nOn Lexington Avenue between 28th and 29th Streets three stores are bursting with the spices, flours, nuts, legumes and other staples of the Indian larder, along with fresh herbs and produce. All sell wholesale, retail and by mail order. They are Spice Corner, 135 Lexington Avenue, (212) 689-5182; Foods of India, Sinha Trading Company, 121 Lexington Avenue, (212) 683-4419, and Kalustyan's, 123 Lexington Avenue, (212) 685-3451.\nOn the Lower East Side, Dowel Quality Products, 91 First Avenue, at Fifth Street, (212) 979-6045, has a multitude of Indian foods, packaged and fresh, at good prices.\nIn Jackson Heights, Queens, there are small Indian markets along Roosevelt Avenue. At the intersection of 73d Street and 37th Avenue, two large stores carry fresh herbs, fruits, vegetables and breads in abundance, as well as packaged foods: New Apna Bazar and, directly across the street, Subzi Mandil.\nIn Brooklyn, Sahadi, 187-89 Atlantic Avenue, (718) 624-4550, carries Indian spices.

The challenge is to speed distribution to the rural areas, where most people live.\nBangladesh's Prime Minister, Sheik Hasina Wazed, met on Tuesday with her Cabinet ministers and instructed them to hasten the distribution of food-ration cards to four million households, many of whom lost their ability to make a living when the floods swamped their crops, drowned their cattle and destroyed their seed stocks.\nShe also ordered that a food-for-work program to rebuild damaged roads begin by Saturday and that a much larger reconstruction program get under way immediately, putting money in people's pockets and food on their tables.\nShe has asked for $880 million in foreign aid and has received pledges of about $129 million, the Government says.\nRepresentatives of international relief agencies praise Sheik Hasina's administration for removing bureaucratic obstacles, but they also worry that it is taking too long for the rice and wheat to pass through four levels of government to the smallest administrative unit.\n''The machinery at our disposal is a good one,'' said Werner Kiene, representative of the United Nations World Food Program in Dhaka, the capital. ''But we need to give it more speed, and the food needs to be pushed through this machinery.''\nSimilarly, the difficulty of treating people with diarrhea is not a shortage of the inexpensive life-saving solution of water, electrolytes and sugar that replenishes depleted bodily fluids, but delivery to sufferers.\nIn many areas that are still partly flooded, the waters are now too shallow for boats to cross but the roads are still too muddy for wheeled vehicles to pass, said A. K. Siddique, an epidemiologist with the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research in Dhaka.\n''We are entering the most vulnerable period, when inaccessibility is the main constraint,'' he said.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[{"tagged_token_id":"bf218154-fa99-405a-817b-b8d053991f19","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"e5cd7259-d080-48da-beb9-76d877241ade","start":86,"end":100,"tag":"Flood type","tag_id":"6de6f201-e6f3-46be-845f-21a8d8190680","value":"Monsoon floods","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:50:01.57+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"ab924fcb-145e-4943-8c36-e6fb46eaca1f","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"e5cd7259-d080-48da-beb9-76d877241ade","start":61,"end":85,"tag":"end date context","tag_id":"88cf8c2b-74e5-4ceb-8d00-3c3b56f4dacb","value":"1998-10-09T05:00:00.000Z","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:50:21.968+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"7857e975-26d8-49c9-ad34-93df617088ed","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"e5cd7259-d080-48da-beb9-76d877241ade","start":0,"end":13,"tag":"Start date context","tag_id":"d59b20b0-f04b-4098-8f91-1b1050cdb9bd","value":"2-Month Flood","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:50:36.456+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"3102fa05-16a9-41f6-abae-0062c3613477","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"e5cd7259-d080-48da-beb9-76d877241ade","start":715,"end":730,"tag":"houses affected","tag_id":"b9c0eba3-c255-42cc-af6d-5cd27cb4b73c","value":"a million homes","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:51:50.777+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"648f16d2-512d-4c39-b666-7589c84df94c","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"e5cd7259-d080-48da-beb9-76d877241ade","start":1216,"end":1257,"tag":"fatalities","tag_id":"69f4e5af-f7a5-4631-aaf4-2f4704e347d5","value":"The official death toll now stands at 918","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:52:27.665+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"e5cd7259-d080-48da-beb9-76d877241ade","classname":"Monsoon ","class_id":"a4fc0707-94d3-4ddb-8b3a-6dd4da2f2e84","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:52:44.226+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"e5cd7259-d080-48da-beb9-76d877241ade","classname":"Bangladesh","class_id":"d89a6030-48e2-44b1-86d4-e64cfe3abb59","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:52:46.153+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"e7e59238-6184-4c8d-8177-85a655dba63f","content":"Lives Held Cheap in Bangladesh Sweatshops\n2001-04-15T05:00:00.000Z\nThe fire in the garment factory began on the fourth floor, where polo shirts, neatly folded in boxes, made a fine feast for the hungry flames. The 1,250 workers scampered for their lives, most of them hurrying to the stairway that led to the main exit. There, at the bottom, was a folding gate. It was locked.\nIn panic, the trapped people spun around, rushing back up the steps, colliding with those coming down. It was night. The lights had gone out. Some workers squeezed through windows, shimmying down an outside pipe or chancing a desperate leap.\nThe rest were caught in a human knot on the dark stairs, arms pushing, mouths screaming, hearts pounding. Some people fell and were trampled. That is how nearly all of the fire's 52 victims died, their final breaths stomped out of them on the hard concrete of the teeming steps. Most were young women. Ten were children.\nWhat Bangladesh has to offer the global economy is some of the world's cheapest labor -- and what this impoverished nation has received in return is the economic boost of a $4.3 billion apparel industry, the fuller pockets that come with 1.5 million jobs and the horrors that arise from 3,300 inadequately regulated garment factories, some of which are among the worst sweatshops ever to taunt the human conscience.\n''We still suffer from the legacy of the colonial days,'' said one factory owner, Muhammad Saidur Rehman. ''We consider the workers to be our slaves, and this belief is made all the easier by a supply of labor that is endlessly abundant.''\nFor the most part, it is the wretched of the earth who do the world's tailoring. Made in Bangladesh competes with Made in Honduras, Made in the Philippines, Made in Macao, Made in Any Steamy Reservoir of Third World Unemployment: those places where plentiful labor lacks the leverage to command high pay, and the most pitiful thing about the jobs is how hard it is to get them.\nLast November's fire at Chowdhury Knitwears interrupted a frantic production schedule. Finished sportswear was due at stores in Britain. The workers, used to a 12-hour day, were ordered to toil as long as 18. They were given a lunch break at 1 p.m., then a shorter breather at 10 p.m., when each received a piece of bread and a banana.\nHolidays, mandated by law, were a myth at the Chowdhury factory, said dozens of employees. People were expected to work virtually every day of the year. Overtime pay, another legal requirement, was also a myth. Most wages ranged from $25 to $50 a month -- or as little as 6 cents an hour. Children earned less.\n''When we'd complain, they'd lock the gates so we couldn't get out,'' said Aleya Begum, a sewing machine operator here on the outskirts of Narsingdi, 35 miles northeast of Dhaka, the capital. ''If someone complained too much, they were fired.''\nThose long hours had never included a fire drill. And, in the days after the blaze, outraged politicians demanded accountability for the senseless deaths. They decried the garment industry's callous disregard for safety and lamented the government's listlessness in making inspections. Cabinet ministers comforted the hospitalized. The prime minister offered condolences, praying that each of the departed souls would enjoy a peaceful hereafter.\nSuch hand wringing in a fire's aftermath is by now a studied ritual. Bangladesh's garment industry is barely 15 years old, but the business has grown so rapidly that it accounts for 76 percent of the nation's exports. The number of manufacturers continues to multiply, as do the recurring nightmares: the flames, the locked doors, the frenzied stampedes, the mourning. Since 1995, there have been 30 of these fires, with 17 involving fatalities, according to one labor group that has maintained a list.\nFactories are often makeshift enterprises, many of them in the rented upper floors of Dhaka's decrepit downtown buildings. Workers trudge up the narrow stairs, ready to stitch bright fabric beneath the whirling bobbins. Electrical wiring is frequently a jangle of overloaded circuits.\nThe posttragedy ritual is not a prolonged one, however. Reports of investigators are expediently moved along the bureaucracy's chain of command and then into oblivion. Accountability, so keenly demanded at first, is never quite determined at last.\nOne more tangible result is a short period of haggling. Bereaved families expect compensation for lost loved ones. After the Chowdhury fire, the factory's workers staged protest marches and were joined by thousands of sympathizers.\nThe basic demand was 200,000 taka per victim, about $3,700. That was far beyond the usual recompense. But then this had been an especially shocking tragedy.\nUpset by the catastrophe and alarmed by bad publicity, leaders of the powerful manufacturing associations met and decided to chip in, adding a sum to the Chowdhury factory's own contribution. Together, they pledged a death benefit they deemed generous: about $1,945.\nNannu Mia, a survivor of the Nov. 25 fire, had helped organize the workers' protests. ''Maybe this was a mistake,'' he said recently, permitting himself an anguished moment of reflection. ''Maybe I should have licked their boots instead.''\nFor him, the protests have proved regrettable. Among the workers' demands was a swift reopening of the factory. While this did occur only 44 days after the fire, Mr. Mia was not welcomed back. He said that being an agitator cost him his job.\nAt Chowdhury Knitwears, the hours may be a strain and the wages a heartache. But almost anyone will say that even a dreadful job is better than none.\nA Place Rich in Cheap Labor\nThe apparel business is a very tough dollar, with profit margins figured to the fraction of a penny. The actual sewing of a shirt is but a tiny part of the final pricing, which must account for cloth, cutting, dyes, packaging, freight, duties, warehousing, advertising, floor space and salespeople.\nConsumers want bargains. So retailers try to wrench lower prices from suppliers, who in turn want the clothes stitched at the lowest possible cost. For a poor nation, rich only in cheap labor, the garment industry is a well-trod pathway into the global marketplace.\nBangladesh has a population of 131 million -- about half that of the United States -- all packed into a country slightly smaller than Iowa.\nIts garment workers take home an average monthly wage of $35 for women and $40 for men, according to Rita Afsar, of the Bangladesh Institute for Development Studies. Those earnings are about 25 percent higher than the nation's per capita income.\nIn the Narsingdi area, with a population of about 3 million, Chowdhury Knitwears is one of the few major factories. Virtually all employees returned to the whitewashed four-story building after the fire. Orders for polo shirts were still unfilled. Fabric in colors with fancy names -- rust, midnight, shadow green, putty, orange peel, brilliant blue -- was piled on tables.\nThe building looked much as always, but important changes had been made. Smoke alarms were installed. Thin pipes ran along the ceiling. Excessive heat, detected by a temperature gauge, would automatically trigger a defending spray of water.\nThis new safety equipment cost nearly $20,000, complained Tanveer Chowdhury, known as Sagar, the managing director of his family's business. A heavy-set man, he was seated in a first-floor office, nervously fingering the gold chain around his neck. He expressed no regret about the loss of life. But he did have more complaints to make.\n''This fire has cost me $586,373,'' he said. ''And that doesn't include $70,000 for machinery and around $20,000 for furniture. I had made commitments to meet deadlines, and I still have those deadlines. I am now paying for air freight at $10 a dozen when I should be shipping by sea at 87 cents a dozen. That means I am paying . . .'' He pecked at a calculator with his right index finger. ''. . . 12 times the shipping price.''\nMr. Chowdhury was not there the day of the inferno, but his brother Shamim had not only been present, he also tried to fight the flames. The fire had begun with a spark from an electrical spot gun, used to spray stain remover on soiled merchandise. The blaze then spread to a can of flammable liquid, and a fireball took off.\nA try was made at smothering the flames with shirts. Then a fire extinguisher was unlatched, but it malfunctioned, painfully discharging its contents into Shamim's face.\nSagar Chowdhury, 34, described the scene, then woefully shook his head. ''When everything is O.K., this business is very good,'' he said. ''Now it is not good.''\nThe family also owns a towel factory, which exports exclusively to America, he said. Three years ago, they expanded into knitwear because ''the money is better.''\nMr. Chowdhury boastfully returned to his world of numbers, saying that in a good year the business netted $1 million. Less happily, he disputed what his employees had reported about their wages. He said while some did earn as little as the equivalent of $22 a month, others made as much as $74. He said he paid double for overtime. Then, with closer questioning, he grew huffy and distracted.\nBut he did confide the gist of his ample experience. ''Knitwear is a headache business,'' he said, flicking one hand as if to slap something away. ''Headaches with quality, size, color, everything.''\nA beleaguered businessman, Mr. Chowdhury rubbed his forehead as if this might make the aching go away.\n'Good Order' to 'No Order'\nBangladesh's garment factories run the gamut. Some seem models of progressive management, with health clinics, day care centers and brightly lighted lunch rooms. Workers wear surgical masks to screen out fibers in the air, and shiny red fire extinguishers hug the walls at regular intervals. Other factories are bleak, stuffy places with cramped aisles that dead-end into haphazard knolls of fabric. Guards are stationed at locked gates, and fire prevention largely consists of empty red water pails.\nTo export, a factory owner must be a member of one of the nation's three textile associations. These groups then have great power. And from time to time, their leaders discuss whether they have some duty to use this clout to improve working conditions.\n''Inhuman things do go on, and it's horrible, horrible,'' said Kutubuddin Ahmed, the newly elected president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, the biggest of the three. ''That Chowdhury fire business, this was horrible.''\nMr. Ahmed said that perhaps the time had come for rigorous inspections, to find out what factories were in ''good order, semi-order and no order,'' and that the worst of the lot might face a suspension of their export privileges. ''But we don't want to threaten our members or create a panic,'' he added in afterthought, cautiously moderating his zeal.\nDo-gooders here are suspected of shallow thinking. Panic -- as well as American naïveté -- is widely blamed for a misguided rescue of working children. In 1993, after news media exposés about Bangladesh's garment factories, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, introduced a bill to ban products made with child labor.\nFrightened employers impulsively fired tens of thousands of children under the age of 14. By and large, this was not any great setback to the bosses. Very often, they had hired the children as a favor to woebegone parents. Within the next few years, as the Harkin bill became law, about 10,000 of the children ended up in special schools created by Unicef. But most others simply found more dangerous and less lucrative work -- breaking rocks, rolling cigarettes, pulling rickshaws.\n''There's no such thing as an unmixed blessing,'' said Roushan Jahan, an author of a book about garment workers. ''Progress leaves loopholes. A lot is left to the factory owner's good will, and there is a great deal of curdling in the milk of human kindness.''\nSo what can be done? If manufacturing groups are hesitant to act, if government inspectors are easily bribed, if labor unions are yet to find a foothold, if human consciences are easily held in abeyance, what can make an owner improve conditions?\nRecently, the biggest force for reform has come from big retailers worried about the bottom line. Some, like Gap and Wal-Mart, were embarrassingly linked to third world sweatshops and are now rehabilitating their image. Others fear similar scandals that might make softhearted customers feel guiltily attired.\nSome major companies now issue codes of conduct and send inspectors into their suppliers' factories to enforce the rules, counting fire exits and auditing overtime records.\nThese controls are imperfect and a few critics even deride them as farce. And they do not greatly inflate the pay. At Shanta Apparel Ltd. in Dhaka, which has manufactured goods for Tommy Hilfiger, J. C. Penney and Gap, an average employee earns $42 a month, the manager said. But the factory supplies its workers with purified water, clean bathrooms and a doctor on the premises. Doors stay unlocked. There are fire exits.\n''That's the wave of the future, buyers who order you to put in two more toilets and place more space between the machines,'' said Monjural Hoq, president of one of the other manufacturing associations. ''That's all fine, as long as they pay us more to get it.''\nAn Uncertain Future\nMost factories do not work with the major stores, however. And in Bangladesh there is motivation for owners to gobble up maximum profits before it is too late.\nFor all the garment industry's success, its future hangs by a thread. Nearly half the exports go to America, where a quota system on imported clothes has favored Bangladesh, limiting some of its biggest competitors to a smaller share of the United States market.\nBut those quotas expire on Jan. 1, 2005.\nAfter that, the lure of cheap labor may not be enough. Other circumstances make Bangladesh a less practical supplier. Power outages are epidemic. Floods wash away roads. The port is overwhelmed. More important, raw materials for manufacturing need to be brought in at added expense.\nWithout quota restrictions, China and India, which grow their own cotton, are likely to capture far more of the business from the United States.\nAnd many poor Bangladeshis -- suddenly jobless -- will find themselves poorer still.\nTwo-thirds of the garment workers are women. With Bangladesh being a conservative Muslim country, a factory job is one of the few socially acceptable ways for a woman to earn a living. In Dhaka, most of them live in mammoth slums that while deplorable for their squalor are notable for being less squalid than others.\nAround Narsingdi, workers are more likely to live in villages with the open air, ripening jackfruit and the moist green of rice paddies. Four months after the fire, the area still seems contaminated by despair. Families have yet to adjust fully to rearrangements, with newly orphaned children handed back and forth.\nMost any villager can lead a sorrowful tour. One stop was a bamboo hut, where a 14-year-old named Parina was sitting outside on a stool. Her brother Alauddin, who was 12, had died in the fire, she said. The family badly misses the $11 he earned each month, but they have nevertheless kept another son, 13-year-old Jalaluddin, from returning to Chowdhury Knitwears. ''He switched to a brick kiln,'' Parina said.\nKhodeza Begum has three surviving children, but none yet old enough to replace her son Zakir, 15, who had been the family's only breadwinner. ''After the fire, all the bodies were laid out in a row,'' she said, cupping a small photograph of the boy. ''When I saw his face I fainted.''\nRashida Begum, 18, a fragile-looking woman who has returned to the factory though an injured right hip prevents her from walking easily, was living nearby. She was trampled as she attempted to escape the fire and remembers a rampage of feet on her before she lost consciousness. ''My mistake was that I fell,'' she said glumly.\nAbdul Qader Mullah, a skilled mechanic, is a muscular young man. People think he is important to meet because of the awful twist to his story. He bravely stayed behind to fight the fire, finally lowering himself from the roof with a cable. But by the time he escaped, his younger brother had been killed, re-entering the building to look for him.\n''His body was so terribly burned up I only recognized him from his belt buckle,'' Mr. Mullah said. ''One of our friends, Liton, he also died after going back into the fire. He had been paid that day and left his money in his other pants.''\nThe surviving families are separated by a peculiar financial distinction. Only 39 of the 52 victims are officially confirmed dead, with their bodies having undergone an autopsy. Other families either refused to allow the post-mortem, thinking it an indignity, or buried their loved ones too hastily. They have been denied the $1,945 compensation.\n''Thirty-nine confirmed dead, that's the official figure,'' said Dr. Atiqul Sarwar, head of a nearby hospital and a member of the government-appointed committee that investigated the fire.\n''The blame,'' he continued, ''was actually due to management. There was a minimum of fire extinguishers. Workers were locked in. The emergency exit was itself a danger. It was too steep, sloping almost straight down.''\nOddly, and inappropriately, the doctor cracked a smile. He knew this made him appear unfeeling and he apologized. But he was recalling a friendly disagreement with the committee's chairman -- and enough time had now passed to prove him right.\nIn Bangladesh, life, like labor, is cheap, Dr. Sarwar explained. He had insisted their investigation would be a waste of time; the other man said no. ''I told the chairman we'd accomplish nothing. I told him, 'Relax, relax, just relax. The hue and cry lasts only awhile. And then it means nothing.' ''\nMade in Squalor\nLater articles will continue the examination of third world production for first world markets.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"e7e59238-6184-4c8d-8177-85a655dba63f","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:52:56.171+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"efb2e399-17f9-448a-9c05-9b74a0263b13","content":"Editorial Observer; Welcome to New York: The Place Where Two Candidates Are a Crowd\n1998-08-16T05:00:00.000Z\nThirty Second Job Aptitude Quiz: Take this test to determine whether you have what it takes to be a Democratic party boss in New York City.\nProblem: A Republican state senator who was unopposed last election has taken positions that are unpopular with the many immigrants in his district. A local school board official, who is also an immigrant and an active Democratic party worker, volunteers to run against him. Should you:\nA) Break out the champagne and offer up a novena of thanksgiving.\nB) Prepare for a primary, since you have been actively recruiting candidates yourself.\nC) Tell him you do not want to see the Republican senator troubled with an opponent.\nCongratulations if you picked C! You have a promising future within the New York Democratic Party. Everybody else will have to consider careers in more vital industries, like blacksmithing.\nMorshed Alam, school board member and president of the New American Democratic Club in Queens, was the candidate who volunteered to run for the State Senate seat long held by the Republican Frank Padavan. ''Frank Padavan, I feel, is anti-immigrant, and for the last six years he didn't have any opposition,'' said Mr. Alam, who came here 14 years ago from Bangladesh.\nThe Queens Democratic chairman, Thomas Manton, was not pleased. Mr. Alam said Mr. Manton told him that he wanted to give Mr. Padavan a free ride so the Senator's supporters would stay home in November, making life easier for other Democrats in the area. ''They said my candidacy could make Frank Padavan do more campaigning,'' reported Mr. Alam, who nevertheless persisted in getting onto the ballot.\nThe Let Sleeping Senators Lie theory is one of the many excuses New York politicians find to skirt the dreaded prospect of actual elections -- terrible, uncontrollable events in which voters are unleashed to do any wild and crazy thing they want. There is only one way to win an election in this state. But, to paraphrase Paul Simon, there must be 50 ways to avoid having one.\nQuit late at night, Dwight. Don't make a fuss, Gus. Mr. Manton, who is also a member of Congress, recently took advantage of a small legal window of opportunity to retire and handpick his successor without the fuss of a party primary. ''I've always wanted to be in Congress,'' declared the lucky heir, Assemblyman Joseph Crowley, who is best known for loyalty to Mr. Manton and a successful drive to require the teaching of the history of the Irish potato famine in public schools. Asked to describe the qualities that distinguished Mr. Crowley from other Democrats who wanted the seat, Mr. Manton demurred. ''I can't give you chapter and verse,'' he said. By the next day, he had settled on ''youth.''\nThe Queens Republican organization, observing a Let Sleeping Congressmen Lie rule, had not put up a candidate, and Mr. Crowley's opposition in November will be a minor party candidate and a political gadfly without organization or campaign funds. Privately, the Republican leaders expressed no hard feelings. ''It was very clever,'' said one. ''And of course Tom couldn't have allowed a Democratic primary. It would have been a blood bath.'' (Snap Quiz: A blood bath is another word for A) massacre, B) slaughter, C) election.)\nLook for the slip, Chip. Take him to court, Mort. Meanwhile in Brooklyn, Representative Edolphus Towns was energetically attempting to eliminate a primary challenger named Barry Ford through the classic method of claiming that a woman who collected voter signatures on Mr. Ford's behalf was not a registered Democrat residing in the Congressional district. This requirement goes back to the 1940's, when state legislators wanted to make sure that Communists from the Soviet Union did not slip into East Harlem to collect signatures for a left-wing Congressman named Vito Marcantonio.\nThese technical challenges are harder to make stick nowadays, but they are still pursued through expensive court battles, all over the state. A Democratic novice Congressional candidate named Dick Collins temporarily managed to knock the incumbent Republican, Sue Kelly, off the ballot for failing to put numbers on her pages of signatures. The most interesting part of that story was the Democrat's refusal to acknowledge that any of Ms. Kelly's constituents might have been upset in November when they went to the polls and found nobody but Dick Collins on the ballot.\nRepresentative Towns has not had a serious race in his 16-year career -- Republicans are as plentiful as musk oxen in the 10th Congressional District. Yet the people fighting to get Mr. Ford tossed off the ballot seemed absolutely dumbfounded by the suggestion that the district voters would prefer having a choice.\n''Do you feel that way about everybody in America?'' asked his aide.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"efb2e399-17f9-448a-9c05-9b74a0263b13","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:53:08.418+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]},{"example_id":"f364613d-20e9-452f-badd-be382ca38680","content":"RESTAURANTS; Spice World\n1998-04-05T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE term Namaskaar refers to the Indian pressed-palms greeting, and it suits the restaurant, a bit of grace in an otherwise drab mall. Beyond the concrete face of the mall, which is also appropriately named, the unlyrical Mall at IV, Namaskaar drapes its tables in linen, covers its walls with mirrors and brightens its mood with red carnations. The vast space and otherworldly demeanor of the servers also obscures the fact that you are in Paramus and not in, say, the Marabar Caves.\nTo help transport you, Namaskaar serves wine as well as Indian beers like Kingfisher and cold 22-ounce bottles of Taj Mahal. Papadum, the nachos of Indian food, are sufficiently peppery, and pita-like kulcha is brushed with butter and deliciously flavored with sweet and crunchy onion. Both ease your passage into the complex dishes of northern India served with finesse at this restaurant -- one flight below a Weight Watcher's center.\nWhether or not you like chaat, or Indian snacks, you'll love Namaskaar's potato version, drenched in yogurt and resonant with coriander and fruity tamarind. After a couple of forkfuls, you're going to wonder why Americans ever adopted mayonnaise as their universal dressing.\nVeterans follow with a kachumber salad, and you should also. Namaskaar's mix of cucumbers, tomatoes and onions, dressed in raita, the velvety yogurt, cucumber and cumin dressing, is the perfect antidote to the hotter, more provocative dishes ahead. Lamb or vegetable samosas, for example, are crisp, puffy pyramids filled with peas and either lamb or potatoes. The ideal version straddles the line between crisp and chewy, light and hearty, and Namaskaar's samosas embody all these qualities. Pakoras, deep vegetable fritters, are less consistent. The shredded onions are the onion equivalent of pommes frites -- hot, crisp stalks of starchy pleasure -- but the deep-fried potatoes, eggplant and even cauliflower fritters are as dull and greasy as street-corner empanadas.\nThe lamb and chicken kebabs are heavier alternatives, although in this incarnation they are light and juicy. Only the chicken seekh kebab, ground chicken marinated with coriander and then baked, seemed oddly flavorless. The chicken mulligatawny soup pours like velvet but is also slightly pallid.\nHappily, main courses are generally heartier. Chicken tandoori arrives in all its glory, an intact half bird marinated in the blend of yogurt and paprika that gives it its characteristic pink color. Shrimp tandoori, eight fat, juicy pieces, are equally moist and surrounded by the same slippery onions and sweet bell peppers that ring the chicken. The highlight among the tandoori dishes, however, is fish tikka masala, large meaty chunks of tilefish blasted in the intense heat of the tandoori, or traditional clay oven, and then baked in a velvety stew of peppers and tomatoes.\nMore timid diners may prefer the quieter pleasures of chicken tikka masala. The popular creamy chicken dish is as mild as it is familiar -- my mother's kind of curry. Channa masala, in which the chicken is replaced by chick peas, is also harmless, although this version lacks verve or maybe just coriander. Fortunately, Sunil Gomes, the talented Bangladeshi chef, turns up the heat, but not too violently, for his Goan shrimp curry, which he wisely lightens with only modest amounts of coconut. The result is a curry that tastes of a thousand more interesting flavors -- cardamom, cumin, coriander, the three C's of Indian cooking -- than merely coconut.\nIn the vegetarian department, saag paneer is the prize. A mix of Indian cheese, which is a mild cottage cheese, and spinach, it's comfort food but with real personality. Some saag paneers are mushy; this one is creamy and lush. More adventurous diners may prefer dal makhani, the popular lentil and kidney bean stew that arrives just how you want it: so hot that you can manage only modest spoonfuls. Or pour it over vegetable biryani, a platter of basmatic rice brightened with carrots, peas, onions, nuts and raisins.\nFinally, in the high-heat realm, Adarsh Saigal, the Bombay-born owner who opened Namaskaar in 1991, presides over one of the few proper lamb vindaloos in the area. Some vindaloos taste merely hot; this one is appealingly tart, thanks to the sensible balance of vinegar and hot chilies.\nIt and other Indian dishes demand bread. Poori, the great, puffy blowfish-like creation, isn't greasy in this rendition, and although whole-wheat paratha and pita-like kulcha ooze onion and other flavorful ingredients, neither tears at your heart like naan. Soft, moist and made of elemental ingredients (water and white flour), it emerges from the tandoori oven hot, blistered and deliciously smoky.\nAmong the desserts, mango lassi, an Indian smoothie, works better as a snack. It's much too sweet after a filling dinner, but then Indian desserts are all too treacly by Western standards. Two of the more beloved offenders are gulab jaman (fried cheese balls scented with cardamom) and rasmalai (Indian cheese in a milky potion), and Namaskaar prepares both with dexterity. Gajar halwa, a carrot pudding with a crispy texture, is a lighter alternative, and kulfi is creamy ice cream with almonds, although it hardly rivals Ben & Jerry's.\nThe cappuccino is dreadful, but why bother when the Darjeeling tea that the kitchen transforms into a spicy brew with clove, cardamom and cinnamon is far more soothing? The fennel seeds at the door are also a subtle pleasure. For people heading up to their first Weight Watchers meeting, I can't think of a better place for a last supper.\nNamaskaar\n123 Mall at IV, Route 4 West, Paramus\n(201) 342-8868\nGOOD\nATMOSPHERE Sitar music in the mall.\nSERVICE Unerringly gracious.\nRECOMMENDED DISHES Papadum, potato chaat, raita, tandoori chicken, fish tikka kabab, Goan shrimp curry, lamb vindaloo, vegetable biryani, saag panir, dal makhani, naan, rasmalai, gulab jaman, gajar halwa; kulfi, spiced tea.\nPRICE RANGE Lunch: buffet, $9.95 a person.

But in the end it's the same. I have nothing left.\"\nOnly the roof of his thatch house was visible above the muddy green waters that turned his village of Malinagar into a lagoon two weeks ago. Beneath the rippling surface, the straw walls have slipped over and his stock of grain for the winter, his clothes, furniture and children's possessions are slowly rotting.\nThe monsoon rains in India are a democratic force. When the skies open, the water pours on the homes of rich and poor alike. But after the deluge, the poor always suffer most.\nBihar is the most backward state in India, barely touched by the soaring growth and new economic confidence of the major cities. Yet there are gradations within this poverty, and sub-classes of richer and poorer co-exist. The richer residents of Malinagar still have their homes, made from sturdy brick and concrete. Some managed to shelter on their flat roofs, when the flood came at the start of the month. The poorer, living in shacks without electricity, at the exposed edges of the village, had to flee to roughly made shelters on higher land.\nThose with a few hundred rupees to spare were able to buy plastic sheeting from the market, which they slung between bamboo poles to protect their families against the lashing rain. Others had only the scant cover offered by saris and stitched-together sacks. The most ill-prepared huddled beneath plantain leaves. Later they witnessed their own flimsy homes sink beneath the waters, disintegrating in the currents.\nThis week the flood began receding, replaced by a stinking, stagnating sludge, but villages remain cut off, and many of those houses that have re-emerged are uninhabitable. Hundreds of thousands of people are still sheltering beneath bed sheets along the raised highways crisscrossing the state, just inches away from the traffic, which grinds past, splattering them with mud. Life cannot yet begin again for most of the 14 million that the United Nations estimates have been affected by the crisis in Bihar.\nUnicef officials said Thursday that about 2,800 people in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan have died since the monsoon season began from drowning, waterborne illnesses, snakebites or hunger. But for most, the real endurance test is just beginning. With crops destroyed and fields bloated with water, there will be no agricultural work for millions of landless laborers here for many months, leaving them to rely on the sporadic support of aid agencies and government relief organizations. Unicef said it was concerned by the prospect of worsening child malnutrition.\nIn a certain light, in the lull between the storms, Malinagar becomes a mirage of watery beauty. Beyond the shells of drowned houses, the floodwaters from the burst Bagmati River stretch as far as the eye can see. A month ago, the lake was a parched wheat field. Now village girls sit like mermaids, combing their hair, half-submerged beneath the calm lake waters, cooling themselves; children shriek with excitement as they splash by the shores.\nBut Shankar, who goes by only one name, finds nothing to rejoice at. He is familiar with the deprivation that follows the flood. His wife and two daughters, 6 and 1, live on the wages he earns as a laborer in the fields.\n\"There is no work, so there is no money,\" he said. \"I'm worried about how the children will eat. Even now we are eating dry bread with salt. It's very sad for the children to live like that.\"\nThe village leader, Vijay Sharma, said those with the least to lose had lost the most. \"The richer villagers have ways of working things out. The poorest will not get any work for months more. I don't know how they are going to survive,\" he said.\nAt a national level, the plight of these flood victims attracts little compassion. Early this month, when the United Nations declared these floods the worst in living memory, the miserable condition of the 31 million affected in India was widely covered internationally but was neither front-page news in Delhi newspapers nor featured on national news channels. Instead, bulletins were dominated by the sentencing of a Bollywood star to jail. In one paper, flood coverage was restricted to a short piece on animals being evacuated from a wildlife park.\nSuch apathy is not unusual. English-language newspapers in India often neglect the suffering of the rural poor, more preoccupied with the triumphs of the emerging India than the familiar stories of extreme hardship experienced by hundreds of millions of Indians living on the land.\nEven within the government, attempts to implement a national flood prevention policy have been half-hearted. The official Web site for the Water Resources Ministry states that a National Flood Commission was established in 1976 to draw up a \"coordinated\" and \"scientific\" approach to the problem, but added: \"Though the report was submitted in 1980 and accepted by government, not much progress has been made in the implementation of its recommendations.\"\nSaifuddin Soz, the Indian water resources minister, said that the suggestions of a more recent 2004 task force on flood prevention had also not been implemented because of funding shortages. He said he was hopeful that more resources might be granted as a result of the severe flooding this year. \"Once the crisis is over I will be calling on the cabinet to create a national commission for flood management,\" he said.\nAmong the homeless, waiting for the waters to dry up, there was less optimism.\nAcross Bihar, memories remain fresh of Gautam Goswami, a government official named as one of \"Asia's heroes\" by Time magazine for his \"brilliant\" coordination relief operations after the 2004 floods, who later was accused of embezzling $2 million in flood relief money. The state's reputation for official corruption is well-entrenched, and local journalists question whether money allocated for repairing the river banks was ever spent.\nVictims say the government response this year was slow. When the floods broke, the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, was touring Mauritius. When he returned a week later he was pelted with stones by flood victims, furious at his extended absence. This week there was rioting at two distribution camps in Bihar as the homeless fought for food aid.

The official toll is expected to rise, and one news agency compiled reports from its correspondents around the country and reached a toll of 1,100, The Associated Press reported, with some 650,000 people fleeing their homes.\n However, by the standards of Bangladesh, long vulnerable to nature’s fury, the impact so far seemed likely to be relatively low. \nIn 1991, a tropical storm claimed roughly 140,000 lives. Bangladeshi relief agencies have since developed early warning systems and storm shelters to help people evacuate before disaster strikes. \nAfter its fury on Thursday, the storm weakened today. Still, it brought distress to some of the most vulnerable people on earth. \nPreliminary reports from the fragile delta regions of the Bay of Bengal indicated that rivers had swelled so high that water punched through mud embankments and washed away paddy fields and vegetable fields, ruining the year’s earnings for peasants who live off of those lands. \nIn one district, called Shatkhira, according to local journalists, roughly 5,000 mud homes collapsed into the ground. \nLocal relief workers for Caritas, the Catholic relief agency, reported that an entire island in Barisal district was submerged under at least 6 feet of water, and houses had been blown away by winds. \nEven the capital, Dhaka, though not directly in the path of the storm, felt effects. Electricity towers were down, darkening the entire country for several hours overnight, and much of Dhaka remained without power for most of the day today, which also restricted the water supply. \nRelief and rehabilitation efforts stand to be a crucial test for the army-backed caretaker government currently in charge of Bangladesh. \nThe Indian side of the Bay of Bengal delta was largely spared. Government officials there estimated that 100,000 people had left their homes in search of safety, and, while some trees and roofs had been blown away on the deltaic islands known as the Sunderbans, no casualties were reported and people had already begun returning home. \nThe United Nations Development Program, in pressing world leaders to take immediate steps to address human-induced climate change, argues that the increased frequency of droughts, floods and storms will hit the world’s poor the hardest and exacerbate poverty in places like Bangladesh. \nThe agency is due to come out with details in its annual Human Development Report later this month.","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[{"tagged_token_id":"f78bfd26-1e76-4287-9949-e7e59f65b577","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"f8555648-c067-4a0d-b9a6-2de9057bd59d","start":635,"end":640,"tag":"fatalities","tag_id":"69f4e5af-f7a5-4631-aaf4-2f4704e347d5","value":"1,100","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:54:27.944+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"06ff047f-4445-4c30-b7cb-a7b63022f92e","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"f8555648-c067-4a0d-b9a6-2de9057bd59d","start":683,"end":717,"tag":"people displaced","tag_id":"4d4b0aa8-16e5-4874-bd1e-24b9130c8835","value":"650,000 people fleeing their homes","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:54:40.504+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"c524fac1-d0eb-46d5-8257-333a8a3e9e05","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"f8555648-c067-4a0d-b9a6-2de9057bd59d","start":422,"end":425,"tag":"fatalities","tag_id":"69f4e5af-f7a5-4631-aaf4-2f4704e347d5","value":"667","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:53:58.77+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"2b8323e9-8eb9-4168-a89f-33e379b2ae5b","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"f8555648-c067-4a0d-b9a6-2de9057bd59d","start":1531,"end":1556,"tag":"houses affected","tag_id":"b9c0eba3-c255-42cc-af6d-5cd27cb4b73c","value":"5,000 mud homes collapsed","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:55:38.561+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"3c502a2d-837c-4553-9e2d-31a9270d6906","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"f8555648-c067-4a0d-b9a6-2de9057bd59d","start":2301,"end":2336,"tag":"people displaced","tag_id":"4d4b0aa8-16e5-4874-bd1e-24b9130c8835","value":"100,000 people had left their homes","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:55:18.448+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]},{"tagged_token_id":"c6341f79-5472-4121-bd04-58e801722040","definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"f8555648-c067-4a0d-b9a6-2de9057bd59d","start":1480,"end":1489,"tag":"District","tag_id":"88258074-622f-4734-bbe1-382e03091b16","value":"Shatkhira","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"annotated_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:55:45.329+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}],"classifications":[]},{"example_id":"fa94e7e0-bcb4-42d1-9eee-d15b964d5193","content":"RESTAURANTS; Long on Subtlety, Short on Heat\n2001-01-17T05:00:00.000Z\nWHEN New Yorkers brag about the diversity and depth of their international restaurants, they tend to gloss over a couple of facts. The food map contains some very large blank spots. Regional Mexican is one. Indian is another.\nIndian restaurants of a certain kind can be found by the hundreds in Manhattan and Queens. Most fall into the Curry in a Hurry category: small places with very limited ambitions, usually operated by Bangladeshis. What Greek diners are to Mediterranean cuisine, these are to Indian. New York, with very weak historical ties to the subcontinent, cannot approach the richness and variety of a city like London, which offers everything from ghastly curry and chips shops to glamorous showcases for the best of India's cuisines.\nAda (pronounced ah-DAH) takes a step in the right direction. Or rather, two steps forward and one step back, which adds up to progress in the end. The name, in Urdu, means something done with style or flair, and David R. Shah, the owner, has definite ideas about what style can do for Indian food. The decor, for one thing, steers clear of Indian fabrics, ornate brass plates and beaded curtains in favor of cool silver and gray banquettes, cream walls decorated with white plaster bas-reliefs of a disassembled Indian dancer -- the feet look across the dining room at the arms -- and curlicue glass sconces in cobalt blue and blood red. The silverware is French. It's an oddly elegant room, with a wood-burning fireplace near the door, a spiral staircase leading to an upstairs dining room and a subtle aroma of spices in the air.\nMr. Shah is intent on giving the food an upgrade as well. The full name of the restaurant is, after all, Ada: Maison de l'Inde. The chef, Rajender S. Rana, established his reputation at the Hyatt Regency and the Sheraton in New Delhi, where he was a protege of Jigs Kalara, a well-known consultant and food writer. His outlook is Indian but with an international bent, and the dishes at Ada reflect this in conception and appearance.\nEscabeche of rock shrimp and tuna is flavored with a Goanese tamarind marinade and served in a martini glass. White truffle oil subtly suffuses a lighter-than-air biryani, or rice casserole, speckled with perfectly poached shiitake mushrooms. Ingredients like fingerling potatoes, buffalo mozzarella and mesclun greens dot the menu. Little palate fresheners might be a green-apple sorbet in milk foam, or slices of Asian pear topped by a dab of Coach Farm goat cheese and painted with dill-fig vinaigrette.\nThis Westernized reworking of traditional Indian flavors may frustrate purists, but the results, for the most part, disarm criticism.\nMr. Rana uses spices with great delicacy. Goan barbecue ribs, for example, have a down-home immediacy right down to the mango slaw and onion pakora (indistinguishable from a French-fried onion ring), but a dry rub of chilis and garam masala and the tang from an apple-vinegar marinade create a complex swirl of flavors. Crab Malabar looks like a West Coast wrap but tastes perfectly Indian, with a gentle heat supplied by mustard seed and ginger. The wrapper is a pepper-specked papadum.\nOne of the best appetizers is a slow-grilled white-pea and potato cake accented with garam masala, fennel and cilantro, and surrounded by caramelized bananas coated with creme fraiche.\nAnyone who thinks of Indian spices as hot will learn otherwise at Ada. Mr. Rana, without pulling his punches, uses his spices, and herbs, to augment flavors or add complexity to flavor combinations. Curry leaves underline the sweetness in the delicate coconut crust around a sea bass fillet, and the syrupy, sour-sweet tamarind sauce makes the ideal foil for chicken that comes out of the tandoori oven suffused with the flavors of saffron, garam masala, fenugreek and chilies.\nTandoori usually means desiccated, artificially reddened meat. At Ada, the spices and marinades penetrate every fiber of the meats, which arrive in a state of melting tenderness. A kebab does not have to have the consistency of jerky. Mr. Rana's seek kebabs, little cylinders of ground goat, cilantro and tomato baked in the tandoori oven, remain moist and tender after broiling, and marinated lamb, smeared with a ginger-mint paste, achieves a luscious velvety texture.\nMr. Rana makes some odd choices here and there, and some of his dishes misfire through poor execution. Samosas filled with cepes and shiitake mushrooms are tough. So is the fish in his escabeche. Salmon koftas, listed by the French name quenelles, are so lightly flavored that they make virtually no taste impression whatsoever. Dainty and perfectly shaped into ovals, they amount to a grace note to the main themes set down by lemon rice and a rich coconut curry. The wild mushroom biryani, although sublime, should really be a side dish.\nThe dessert menu severs almost all ties to India. Steve Klc (pronounced keltch), the executive pastry chef, uses a few Indian ingredients strategically, with some success. Coconut panna cotta, covered with a slick of ice-wine gelee and tiny apple dice, has a perfect sweet-tart balance, and a surprise at the bottom of the dish, a firm layer of coconut- cardamom rice.\nChocolate chai souffle stumbles at the outset. Chocolate without chai would be fine. Likewise, chai without chocolate. Together, the two make bad company. Mr. Klc recovers nicely with a disc of apple chutney balanced on top of a spongy layer of ladyfingers and topped with saffron cream.\nAda aims to elevate the status of Indian cuisine in New York. But it has chosen a questionable way to do it, giving authentic flavors and techniques a Western spin. It has also priced the product very high, out of fear, perhaps, that diners cannot respect any cuisine unless it carries a French price tag. For hardened veterans of the $15.95 Indian buffet wars, however, Ada arrives like a piece of good news.\nAda\n** [Rating: Two Stars]\n208 East 58th Street; (212) 371-6060.\nATMOSPHERE: In a coolly decorated, luxurious dining room, Indian food is presented in a European style.\nSOUND LEVEL: Quiet.\nRECOMMENDED DISHES: Crab Malabar, white-pea cake with caramelized bananas, Goan barbecue ribs, Kerala fish curry, ginger mint lamb chops, apple with saffron cream.\nSERVICE: Polite but tentative.\nWINE LIST: A spare list of 20 wines that have little to do with the food.\nPRICE RANGE: Lunch: Appetizers, $10; entrees, $16; desserts, $9.

Suzanne Daley (NYT) \n FRANCE: THIRD AIRPORT FOR PARIS \n The government has announced a plan to build a third Paris airport in Chaulnes, in the Somme Valley about 80 miles north of the capital. The issue has caused a serious rift in the governing Socialist-led coalition because many Green Party members believe a new airport is unnecessary, particularly in light of the current decline in air travel. Some war veterans' groups are concerned that the airport may force the relocation of thousands of World War I graves.

Hanging over her head, however, is the threat of widespread protests against a bill to allow her to stay on in her official residence after she lays down office, with special protective measures for her and her sister, Sheikh Rehana.\nThe sisters are the only surviving members of the family of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the architect of Bangladeshi independence from Pakistan. They escaped death only because they were in England 26 years ago when army officers shot dead Sheikh Rahman, his wife, two sons and several other relatives and attendants.\nAware that they cannot evade justice while Sheikh Hasina is around, the murderers have vowed to \"finish the unfinished revolutionary task\" of the massacre. There have been 10 bomb attacks in the last two years and four direct attempts on the prime minister's life.\nSheikh Hasina has two major achievements to her credit. First, her 1996 victory restored parliamentary democracy after 21 years of rule by military dictators or their nominees and a succession of violent coups. Begum Zia is the widow of General Ziaur Rahman, who seized power after Sheikh Mujib's killing but was murdered by another general some years later.\nSecond, the economy has taken an upturn. Bangladesh is no longer the basket case that the United States feared it would be at the time of its bloody birth in a 1971 war.\nSheikh Hasina says she is committed to building up a \"Golden Bengal\" — an allusion to the title of the national anthem — that is \"free from poverty, hunger and illiteracy.\" Numbers below the poverty line have declined from 47 percent to 43 percent since she took over, literacy has gone up from 47 percent to 64 percent, and a crop of 2.5 million metric tons in 1995-1996 bestowed food self-sufficiency on 125 million Bangladeshis.\nBangladesh is the fifth largest exporter of ready-made garments to the United States, and U.S. investment has spiraled from $20 million to $800 million under Sheikh Hasina.\nPresident Bill Clinton spent longer in Dhaka than in Islamabad during his March 2000 trip to the subcontinent, probably in recognition of Bangladesh's potential, especially as an energy source: The country has considerable natural gas reserves.\nBut the other begum is not giving up so easily. Begum Zia has never been reconciled to her 1996 defeat at the hustings. In her bid for power she has shortsightedly allied her party to the Jatiya Party of the former dictator General Hussain Mohammed Ershad, who is in prison for corruption offenses, and — worse — with two fundamentalist organizations that see Pakistan, or even Afghanistan under the Taleban, as their role model.\nEven if such forces helped Begum Zia to garner votes in October, they would give short shrift afterward to such an affront to Islamic orthodoxy as a parliamentary government headed by a woman.\nThe writer, a former editor of The Statesman in India, contributed this comment to the International Herald Tribune.\n[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]","metadata":{},"seen_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"annotator":"shammun"}],"annotations":[],"classifications":[{"definition_id":"6700d0f9-9b2d-4f55-8905-25a29510fff2","example_id":"ffa60cca-2619-49c6-bd05-d370b78c9913","classname":"Not a flood","class_id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","classified_by":[{"annotator_id":2,"timestamp":"2020-05-06T10:57:15.161+00:00","annotator":"shammun"}]}]}],"schema":{"id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0","archived":false,"slug":"bangaldesh-tag-trial-429","name":"Bangaldesh Tag Trial 4/29","tags":[{"id":"6de6f201-e6f3-46be-845f-21a8d8190680","name":"Flood type","description":"","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"88258074-622f-4734-bbe1-382e03091b16","name":"District","description":"","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"5b3702ff-f4d7-4cb5-9d01-4bf5271a9b4a","name":"Upazila","description":"","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"5b8d5be2-b4c6-493e-85b5-ae597b0d6cd2","name":"Union","description":"","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"3bfba612-fab3-44a8-8e2f-9fb4ab18f610","name":"Village","description":"","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"d59b20b0-f04b-4098-8f91-1b1050cdb9bd","name":"Start date context","description":"","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"88cf8c2b-74e5-4ceb-8d00-3c3b56f4dacb","name":"end date context","description":"","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"69f4e5af-f7a5-4631-aaf4-2f4704e347d5","name":"fatalities","description":"","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"b9c0eba3-c255-42cc-af6d-5cd27cb4b73c","name":"houses affected","description":"","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"4d4b0aa8-16e5-4874-bd1e-24b9130c8835","name":"people displaced","description":"","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"5b973923-7df3-47eb-86cb-36014e686cc4","name":"disease","description":"","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"fce0b935-55d6-455e-9373-7b356d2d6f25","name":"crop type","description":"","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"649a6d40-8cca-46ca-a71e-e78ca70f6bb0","name":"crop damage (area)","description":"","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"470795fa-2cb4-455a-bf72-91c70ab74b97","name":"crop damage (taka)","description":"","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"65feb009-90b0-4d3b-aa2c-587669701a70","name":"region/geographic information","description":"","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"}],"project":"0b4b1a93-37f2-4492-b426-928145d4e491","classification_types":[{"id":"d89a6030-48e2-44b1-86d4-e64cfe3abb59","name":"Bangladesh","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"a4fc0707-94d3-4ddb-8b3a-6dd4da2f2e84","name":"Monsoon ","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"c58ff0e2-2ba5-46e6-8685-87bdd1c4306d","name":"Not a flood","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"ee883943-9b84-4b49-b4c3-526588cd6ff7","name":"Urban","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"19acdbd8-42e8-4af4-94e0-3dac707eb42f","name":"Flash","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"5b04cbba-e2ce-4b2b-805e-0d11e29d4c17","name":"River Erosion","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"0f5f3c97-f750-416d-94c3-b1cdb2c50550","name":"Coastal/Storm Surge","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"},{"id":"33eb7922-7c0c-4f3b-8cd7-b24282055058","name":"Not a historic flood (eg. climate change)","schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"}],"project_id":"0b4b1a93-37f2-4492-b426-928145d4e491","models":[{"id":"e2512687-6807-456c-8fce-9baf35690e17","url":"/api/v1/projects/default/schemas/bangaldesh-tag-trial-429/models/bangaldesh-tag-trial-429-ad-hoc-dict/","slug":"bangaldesh-tag-trial-429-ad-hoc-dict","name":"Bangaldesh Tag Trial 4/29 ad hoc dict","metadata":{},"schema_id":"08608232-3a09-4b74-9fd6-c00be813c7e0"}],"editable":false,"classification_mode":"multiclass"},"dataset":{"id":"fed6ab4c-bcb7-4d85-954c-6e6a88b0737a","slug":"new-dataset-ac94a363","url":"/api/v1/projects/default/datasets/new-dataset-ac94a363/","name":"New Dataset -
