Interspersed with this culinary-education tale is Batali’s own story: Buford’s nearly four-year odyssey includes stints with Batali’s former teachers and a sojourn in Italy in search of the techniques and history of Italian cooking. In the Book Review, Julia Reed said Buford’s “deftly intertwining narratives include everything from high-end restaurant gossip and kitchen secrets to a passionate homage to the rapidly declining traditions of handmade food.” \n",
