    "lead_paragraph": "Updated, 5:23 p.m. | Paper or plastic? It\u2019s no longer much of a choice in the United States, where plastic bags \u2014 introduced in 1977 \u2014 make up 90 percent of all grocery bags, according to the Progressive Bag Alliance, which represents plastic bag manufacturers. Now two City Council members, concerned about the number of plastic bags entering the New York City waste stream, say supermarkets should be required to take an active role in recycling them.City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn and Councilman Peter F. Vallone Jr. are proposing legislation today that would require grocery stores to collect, transport and recycle the bags. The bill would put New York near the forefront of a movement to curb plastic bag use. The United States goes through an estimated 100 billion plastic bags a year, as Peter Applebome noted in an Our Towns column in September.",

Interspersed with this culinary-education tale is Batali\u2019s own story: Buford\u2019s nearly four-year odyssey includes stints with Batali\u2019s former teachers and a sojourn in Italy in search of the techniques and history of Italian cooking. In the Book Review, Julia Reed said Buford\u2019s \u201cdeftly intertwining narratives include everything from high-end restaurant gossip and kitchen secrets to a passionate homage to the rapidly declining traditions of handmade food.\u201d ",

    "lead_paragraph": "On June 25, 1980 (a date he would remember), a good-natured Filipino pool-maintenance man gathered his wife and five children for an upsetting ride to the Manila airport. At 36, Emmet Comodas had lived a hard life without growing hardened, which was a mixed blessing given the indignities of his poverty. Orphaned at 8, raised on the Manila streets where he hawked cigarettes, he had hustled a job at a government sports complex and held it for nearly two decades. On the spectrum of Filipino poverty, that alone marked him as a man of modest fortune. But a monthly salary of $50 did not keep his family fed.",
