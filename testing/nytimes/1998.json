(Agence France-Presse)    AUSTRIA: VOTE TO RETURN ART -- The Austrian Parliament unanimously approved legislation allowing works of art seized by the Nazis and later incorporated into state museums to be returned to their rightful owners. Hundreds of Austrian Jews lost valuable artworks confiscated during Nazi rule of Austria between 1938 and 1945, as well as after the end of World War II when the Government imposed an export ban. Research in state archives this year showed that several Austrian museums had called hundreds of objects of doubtful origin their own for more than 50 years.   (Reuters)",
